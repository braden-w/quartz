# Why [[Choice Feminism]] Led to the Decline of [[Feminism]]
1. freedom or liberation is understood as the capacity to choose.
2. a woman cannot choose her oppression we should support any choice she makes.
3. it is based on the idea that the feminist movement fought for our ability to make choices. So it implies that we are in a post-feminist era.
