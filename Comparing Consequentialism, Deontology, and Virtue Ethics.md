# Comparing [[Consequentialism]], [[Deontology]], and [[Virtue Ethics]]
Making the world better — e.g. helping others.
Acting rightly — e.g. respecting the rights of others and not doing wrong.
Being virtuous — e.g. being honest, kind, and wise.

These correspond to [[Consequentialism]], [[Deontology]], and [[Virtue Ethics]], respectively.
