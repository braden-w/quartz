## Highlights
- 11. Remember the human
  There’s a human being behind every professional.
  Never forget that.
  Take care of your people. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TMitrosilis/status/1553366390995881987))
- 10. Be decisive
  Indecision crushes teams.
  Get feedback + perspective.
  But when it’s time to decide?
  Decide.
  An incorrect decision is better than no decision. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TMitrosilis/status/1553366387833323521))
- 9. Believe when nobody does
  Part of a leader’s job is to instill belief.
  In the mission.
  In the person.
  In the team.
  It’s easy when everyone believes.
  It’s hard when others don’t.
  Believe when belief is hard to find. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TMitrosilis/status/1553366349694509056))
- 7. Accept that it’s your fault
  You are accountable for everything.
  Mistakes aren’t “the team’s” fault.
  They are your (the leader’s) fault.
  This is a critical mindset shift.
  Accept it and watch what happens. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TMitrosilis/status/1553366345177333760))
