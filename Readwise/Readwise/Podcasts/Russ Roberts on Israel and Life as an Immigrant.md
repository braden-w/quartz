## Highlights
- Negotiation in Israel
  Summary:
  There's a certain innocence, i think, to the characters in stesel, which makes it so deeply appealing. The only other observation i want to make is it's a show about ultra religious, ultra orthodox jews. There's no judaism in the show. You know, they murmur and mutter blessings under their breath, but there's no glorification of,. say, the religious experience of the chabot. They're just taken as they are. Negotiation is challenging. I think it's prealy hard for my wife, who likes set prices. Te lot of prices here are just kind of suggestions. They're an invitation to negotiate. In america

  Ye,
  Speaker 1
  one of my favourites, an i stises when akeva, and think it's batsheve, or she pretends, or is actually interested in renting a heater fom him, a portable radiator. And he's just started this business. He's put up a sign around town. It's very unthropinertial for him. Doesn't have much to do with himself other than art. And she shows up at the doorway, and it lasts about 30 seconds. There's incredible tension in that scene, romantic and sexual tension. And it's because they can't, they're not going to do anything, and they're good actors. And so it's a very powerful scene. I've also argued, i think part of the appeal of that show, there's a sert f anthropological voiarism. Here's a culture in a community that's very alien to most people, you know, including modern orthodox jews. Tat's a very different form of religious judaism to the ultra orthodox that they're portraying in that show. And, you know, part of the charm of the show is that, all, theyhave the same problems we do. You know, theyhave trouble with their kids. They're not ture, you know, where theyr gong to make a living. And so that's part of the charm. But i think the other part of the charm is what you're talking about. There's a certain old fashionedness there that people may not want to live that way themsel sbut they like watching it the way they're like reading a jane austen novel, where the mores of romance are long gone in the past. And there's a certain innocence, i think, to the characters in stesel, which makes it so deeply appealing. The only other observation i want to make, which i think is so vastithing to me, is it's a show about ultra religious, ultra orthodox jews. Salmhot's no judaism in the show. You know, they murmur and mutter blessings under their breath, but there's no glorification of, say, the religious experience of the chabot. And they don't make fun of it either. There's no mocking of it or of the attitudes. They're just taken as they are. And i think that was a genius moved by the creators to make that show the way it is, which
  Speaker 2
  is really nor is hardest for you to deal with. Negotiation
  Speaker 1
  is challenging. I think it's prealy hard for my wife, who likes set prices. Te lot of prices here are just kind of suggestions. They're an invitation to negotiate. And there are a few settings in america where that's normal. You buy a house or car, you don't expect to pay liss price, but you do expect to pay list price four say, a hair cut, or, i don't know, a repair or something. But at lot of times the price they announce is just like a hint, a suggestion. And it's very hard for americans to respond to that. If you come here and you get off the plane and you get in a cab, i don't tepryand this happens in america, riht prices in americaor in a cab off the meter, are often negotiated. Cab driver will say something and ha bout if we don't use the meter up at a flat rate. ([Time 0:19:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c7bc69ff-38f8-4dac-b86c-ecc5432b2d04))
- What Do You Think About Arabic Cultures Living in Israel?
  Summary:
  I like to think there's a way that the great religions of the world would get along alittle bit better with followers of those religions. I love the religious moslems i've met face to face. Even religious jews, i think, struggle with faith in a way that many moslem, and christians for that matter, don't struggle with. We are both non moslems, ye. What is it you think we can or should learn from the koran? I don't know koran. Not as much as i'd like to yet. There's a lot of it. Partly depends on where you live, of course. But in the parts of jerusalem that
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Not
  Speaker 1
  as much as i'd like to yet. I mean, i've only been here six months. There's a lot of it. Partly depends on where you live, of course. But in the parts of jerusalem that i live in and walk in, near our camp us here, there's a lot of arab israelis. Most people don't know this. I don't know it well, so i may embarrass myself, but people who are born within the borders of the jewish state right now, in the borders of israel, who are not jewish, arab israelis are full citizens. They get full health care. They get to go subsidized to the universities. They vote. They don't serve in the army, which is fascinating. They don't want to serve in the army, incidentally, which i also understandis complicated for them. And those are distinct from the west bank and gazo, who are palestinians. Then there's some special categories of folks who live in east jerusalem, which is a disputed, more challenging, and i don't know all the insedouts of that, but my wife is going to ulpan upanas hebrew lessons. She goes to upan three hours a day, four days a week. 22 of her 23, i think, er 21 of her 23 classmates are rsraelis who think their hebrew is not good. They all speak hebrew. They speak very good english, but the hebrew 's not good enough. So they're improving their hebrew because they want to go to a good university, they want to get a good education, they want to be in business. And they're all young, by the way. They're all in their twenties. I don't have much exposure to the arab is rally population yet, tat's something to find out about. We
  Speaker 2
  are both non moslems, ye. What is it you think we can or should learn from the koran? I
  Speaker 1
  don't know koran. I love the religious moslems i've met face to face. Is upposed to the ones that are called the cultural zitgeist of islam that's in the air in the west, but the actual moslems that i have met face to face a now, i have a lot in common with them. We believe in god. I think they have a very deep, deep faith, which some jews have, but not all. Even religious jews, i think, struggle with faith in a way that many moslems, and christians for that matter, don't struggle with. So i think there's something to learn there. I think it's possible. I'm naive. I like to think there's a way that the great religions of the world would get along alittle bit better the followers of those religions.

- The Case Against Utilitarianism
  Summary:
  Jerusalem tends to be a more religious city than televieve. It's not even an issue for most disraelis to think about, he says. Living in Israel has made him 'not much of a utilitarian' He admires the Israeli policies toward hostages as he understands them.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Well,
  Speaker 1
  it's not accurate. Might be useful. Is it useful? I've never heard that quite that way. Byther way, i think many of the wide range of views about what the role of the state should be in the country, and whether the government should be more sympathetic or less sympathetic to the religious currents here. Jerusalem tends to be a more religious city than televieve. But there're plenty of orthodox people and religious people in televieve, and there's plenty of non observant people here in jerusalem. They tend to have different rules about how the sabbath is kept in terms of public services. And cultural norms also, of course, play a role. But i don't like that idea, as a jew, i don't like that idea. Is a religious person, don't like the idea that this is this implicit bargain that somehow the alta orthodox, but carrying the water, the ballusterand what you call it, the anchoring the jewishness of the country. It's not even i don't think it's an issue for most disraelis to think about. It that way. I don't think it wouldt come natural. I think that's definitely a riceresque. A reference to william riker, whom i got to be a colleague of for about five years at the university rochester. Is a wonderful, wonderful man, very inciteful and a credible twinkle in his eye. And his work, i think you've probably read it, tyler. He was applying a lot of economic stools in his day, long before other folks. He's kind of, i think, forgotten among our colleagues, but i like him a lot. Does
  Speaker 2
  living in israel and being a citizen there make you more or less utilitarian in your moral philosophy? Why
  Speaker 1
  would it turiusr you have someh in mind. Well,
  Speaker 2
  for instance, the israeli policies toward hostages as i understand them, which is fectly, but from what i can tell, i admire these views, the notion that if some one takes hostages, you simply have to look at the longer term calculation, and you can't cave to every demand. You need to play it quite tough. Is
  Speaker 1
  that utilitarian or non utilitarian? From
  Speaker 2
  my point of view, it's utilitarian. But i'm asking you, i'm not insisting you take my point of view. Living in israel, has it made you more or less utilitarian?
  Speaker 1
  Not much of a utilitarian. I think all of us have some utilitarian impulses by certain cases where it's overwhelmingly clear that too many people who benefit from something, or the size of it so large. ([Time 0:31:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/64ad3c3a-f8db-45ec-bdd8-6e6d01a98ea2))
