## Highlights
- Not just Brain with a Body, but Body with a Brain
  Summary:
  I say, be questioned. I somehow left the definition, the very tight definition of it, out for myself because i felt it was starting to constrict me and be around me. And i let the practice itself really define itbut i think em part of our sense of everything is actually a sense of movement and then the stillness in the background of that. So for me, this is the entity that i refer to as movement. By switching these layers and examining it from different places, you get a better and better sense of it. The visuals nowadays and media, are what the finds for people in the beginning things. And then little by little, wit experience, they can dive deeper

  I say, be questioned. I somehow left the definition, the very tight definition of it, out for myself because i felt it was starting to constrict me and be around me. And i let the practice itself really define itbut i think em part of our sense of everything is actually a sense of movement and then the stillness in the background of that. So for me, this is the entity that i refer to as movement. And using that perspective for self evolution development, of course, the physical side, but also movement of emotions, movement of thoughts, em and any other movement streams. And by switching these layers and examining it from different places, you get a better and better sense of it. I think the visuals nowadays and media, are what the finds for people in the beginning things. And then little by little, wit experience, they can dive deeper, which is good. There is some aspects, sexy aspects, or not so sexy aspects. And then you pull on it and you start to examine and dive deeper, n then you receive the gift of a finding out more. I heard
  Speaker 2
  you say once that we are not just a brain with a body, but we are a body with a brain, which i absolutely love. Because as a student and a researcher of the nervous system, i never think about the brain as its own isolated thing. I think about the nervous system and the fact that the brain and the spinal cord are connected to the body and is connected ahs to the brain in every direction. Its everything truly is connected at the physical level, physiological level. ([Time 0:09:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f1b4913e-c4fb-4895-be57-0ff2f7163691))
- Don’t Specialize in Sport too Early
  Summary:
  "We have to be very careful these, these habits and these directions. They come from, many times, good intention, but they are the devil," he says. "Many times they turn into the devil, just like our technology nowadays." 'Our life is one long developmental arc from birth until death,' adds Sach on mention of sports a maybe it was charles palquin, or maybe itw's another trainer'

  So important too, to remind ourselves
  Speaker 2
  a lot can be done with the body and gravity alor
  Speaker 1
  a piece of a piece of wall, a corner of a room, is a beautiful sceneria which you can become discover in and play in. And but we are not so developed, so we don't see those options. And this is something that i tried to stimulate. And that's why i made it a point to avoid of the big sponsorshipan an hitek tools. And i one point brought a stick into, you know, big conventions. And or i sometimes i use a shirt with holes in it. That's just like i used shirt as a point to make when i'm addressing a crowd, to keep thingswr where it's important, and it's important, we are important, and our experience is important. And we have to be very careful these, these habits and these directions. They come from, many times, good intention, but they are the devil. Many times they turn into the devil, just like our technology nowadays. And what is happening with people with depression, with meaning, meaninglessness, also with the body in various perspectives. Or even, i will also flip it into high performance sports and the ther price. Because for me, this is not a movement practice. It erases the person in the centre of it. And then camein places like scade boarding or brake dancing, where somebody with a disability becomes the best in the world, turns it into the biggest advantage. But i would never be accepted into gymnastics class, and i love that. Andnd that that change to place change in the centre. It er. It's important.
  Speaker 2
  Sach on mention of a few sports a maybe it was charles palquin, or maybe itw's another trainer that i heard once say that, you know, for kids, one of the worst things they can do is over specialize in a particular sport, the idea being that it leads to improvements in performance in a very narrow man but they raised the idea that it perhaps also constrains the development of the nervous system, such that certain emotional states, certain intellectual abilities, will forever be shut off because of the intense plasticity that occurs early in life. The more i learn from the more i'm thinking that that statement really should be extended to all of life. And i love to remind people, because i start off as a developmental norbiologist, that development doesn't start and end. You don't have childhood and adulthood. Our life is one long developmental arc from birth until death, however long that might be. So if one is going to be anti specialist, maybe even we call that a generalist, what does that look ([Time 0:29:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/eaa52122-7e90-4ca3-8856-dc1daffc66da))

- All Animals with Language and True Song have Capacity to Dance
  Summary:
  First of all, he said that when you look at the species in the kingdom, animals, including us, that have elaborate language and true song, they all also have the capacity to dance all the it turns out humming birds actually have a dance and a song capacity.

- Movement and Dancing was the Foundation for Language
  Summary:
  Sophisticated brains tend to create clusters of sophisticated capabilities. The ability to have multiple words for the same concept, or to have elaborate articulation of speech may have been a driving force behind language's evolution. I find this incredibly attractive as an idea. where you have song and dance, you always find that those species can generate elaborate language.

  And where you have song and dance, you always find that those species can generate elaborate language. Now, the simple version of this is howk sophisticated brains tend to create clusters of sophisticated capabilities. But the other possibility, and it's the one that jarvis proposes, and i think it's in line with what you're perhaps raising here, is the idea that movement of the body and range and sophistication of movement of the body through all these different systems, may have actually promoted, or even driven, the evolution of the things that we think of as, you know, speech and language, and the ability to have multiple words for the same concept, or to have elaborate articulation of speech. I find this incredibly attractive as an idea. ([Time 1:13:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/09e30d9f-cd15-498c-b05d-8e69aba2e994))
- Advanced Movement Led to Language
  Summary:
  "It makes perfect sense to me that the layers would be built up fundamentally from the body to the mind, and not the other way around," he says. " jarvis told me that when we read, if, and this has been done experimentally, if one records the e m g, the low level muscular activity in the laringand faranx, we are actually repeating the words that we read."

  Speaker 2
  Because certainly, from as a hierarchy of needs, we needed to move first to survive and to made and to flee and to attack, it makes perfect sense to me that the layers would be built up fundamentally from the body to the mind, and not the other way around. So that's one piece. And then the other piece, which i'll just share for any reflect you might have, that i just blew me away, was jarvis told me that when we read, if, and this has been done experimentally, if one records the e m g, the low level muscular activity in the laringand faranx, we are actually repeating the words that we read, but so subtly so that we don't actually speak them out, unless they're some sort of nerologic deficit, which some people have. Some people mumble whye they ([Time 1:14:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bd5c591f-e8bd-45b2-b12f-da96ee1b7507))

- Language is Movement, and Movement is Language
  Summary:
  When we read, if one records the low level muscular activity in the laringand faranx, we are actually repeating the words that we read. Some people mumble whye they read. But what that tells me is that language is movement, and movement is language. So it's not a problem of nerologic deficit unless you have some sort of narcissistic deficit.

- Handshakes Spread Chemical Knowledge of Others
  Summary:
  I love the idea that through the exploration of a range of physical contacts, provided one knows they can always return to their centre, so to speak. I wish there was more of that encouraged in am children's play, but also, as you mention, in adult environments. There're a lot of environments ashe where hugging is not allowed. In the states, many institutions y you're not allowed to touch anyone else's body. Theres es a wonderful study that comes to my frum an israeli laboratory, goim nom sobo s over there,.

  love the idea that through the exploration of a range of physical contacts, provided one knows they can always return to their centre, so to speak, then there's a lot of opportunity that opens up. I wish there was more of that encouraged in am children's play, but also, as you mention, in adult environments. Because a nowadays, for all sorts of reasons that youve touched on, the idea of keeping at least an arm's length distance as become critical. There're a lot of environments ashe where hugging is not allowed. I don't know what it's like in isral, but in the states, many institutions y you're not allowed to touch anyone else's body. Theres es a wonderful study that comes to my frum an israeli laboratory, goim nom sobo s over there, a who has shown that, by recording people's first interactions, that when people meet, if they shake hands, they almost always, i think it's greater than 85 % of the time, they will then wipe the chemicals from the other person onto their own, typically their eyes or their facethis changed a little bit during the whole pendemic thing, but this is thought to be a carry over from what other animals do in terms of exchanging microbiom elements, exchanging chemicals. Ant were constantly feeding or subconscious with the a chemical knowledge of the chemical constituents of other people, right? So it goes way beyond how people smell, how they look, et cetera. More touch seems to me, just as you said, provided it's consensual, seems like just a really good thing over all. ([Time 2:11:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1e781c79-0686-4cba-bdc5-99ff1bb14980))
