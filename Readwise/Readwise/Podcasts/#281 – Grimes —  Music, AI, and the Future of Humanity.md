## Highlights
- Homotechno?
  Summary:
  We are becoming siborgs, like our brains are fundamentally changed. Everyone who grew up with electronics, we are fundamentally different from previous from homo sapiens. I think we have evolved into homotechno, which is like essentially a new species. Go to blenkes dot com slash leks to start yourre seven day trial and get 25 % off of a blinkes premium membership.

  It is true that we sometimes leave the books we meant to read behind just to acquire the new thing. And i don't think it has to be that way. I think what we ultimately seek is to gain the key insides from a book. You know, there's so many amazing books out there, you can't get a chance to fully read all of them. O use blenkes to at least get the insides. Go to blenkes dot com slash leks to start yourre seven day trial and get 25 % off of a blinkes premium membership. That's blinkes dot com, slash lex, spelled b l i n k i s t, blinkes dot com, slash lex. This is the lex freedman podcast. And here is my conversation with grimes.
  Speaker 1
  We are becoming siborgs, like our brains are fundamentally changed. Everyone who grew up with electronics, we are fundamentally different from
  Speaker 2
  previous from homo sapiens. I call us homotechno. I think we have evolved into homotechno, which is like essentially
  Speaker 1
  a new species.
  Speaker 3
  Previous tech logies, i
  Speaker 1
  mean, may have even been more profound and moved us to a certain degree, but i think the computers are what make us homotechno. I think this is what it's a brain augmentation. So like a lows for actual evolution, like the computers accelerate the degree to which all the other technologies can also be accelerated.

  Speaker 1
  don't write their songs.
  Speaker 2
  I understand this, but
  Speaker 3
  but here's, here's a thing i feel ike, tha,
  Speaker 1
  there's this desire for authenticity. I used to be like, really mad when, like, people wouldn't write or produce their music. And i like that' fake. And
  Speaker 3
  then i realized, um, there's
  Speaker 2
  all this like, weird bitterness and like agroness in art about authenticity.
  Speaker 1
  But had this kind of weird realization recently, a were i started thinking that, like,
  Speaker 3
  art is
  Speaker 1
  sort of a decentralized, collective thing. Like, um, like art is kind of conversation with all the artists that have ever lived before. You, you know, like it's like you're really just, sort of, isn't like anyone's re inventing the wheel here, like, you're kind of just taking, you know, thousands of years of art
  Speaker 2
  and a, like running it through your own little algorithm, and then like, making,
  Speaker 1
  you're, like, your interpretation of it. ([Time 0:21:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c9b083ad-6adc-4c5e-ac40-b7bb41c655f0))

  Summary:
  I think art is something tht sort of brings humanity together. It's also kind of the collective memory of humans. When all this is gone, like, the only thing that's really going to be left is the art. The technology will be obsolete. That is true. A good compression of human history is the art we generate across the different ah centuries of diret different millennia.

  and a, like running it through your own little algorithm, and then like, making,
  Speaker 1
  you're, like, your interpretation of it. You just join in the conversation with all the other artists that came before. It's such a beautiful way to look at it, like, and it's, lik, it's lik, i feel lik, everyone's always, like, there's alwhays copyright and ip and this and that, and or authenticity. And it's just like, like, i think we need to stop this as this, ike, h egotistical thing of, like, oh, the creative genius, the loane creative genius, or this or that. Cause it's like, i think art isn't, shouldn't be about that. I think art is something tht sort of brings humanity together. And it's also, art is also kind of the collective memory of humans. It's like we don't, like, we don't give a fuck about whatever ancient egypt, like how much grain got scent that day in sending the recordsn like, you know, like who
  Speaker 2
  went where, and, you know, how many shields needed to be produced for this. Like, we just remember the their art. And
  Speaker 1
  it's like, you know, it's like, in our day to day life, there's all this stuff that seems more important than art um because it helps us function and survive. But when all this is gone, like, the only thing that's really going to be left is
  Speaker 2
  the art. The technology will be obsolete. It's so fastia, like the humans will be dead. That is true. A good compression of human history is the art we generate across the different ah centuries of diret different millennia. So will the aliens come?

  But daniel k was telling me that,
  Speaker 1
  you know, at the cause i, you know, wen, when i met him, i, likeii came in all furious about spot. If iin't, like, i grilled him super hard, so i got his answers. He but, um, he was saying, like, at the sort of peak of the sedy industry, there
  Speaker 2
  was like, 20 thousand artists making millions and millions of dollars, like there was just like a very tiny, kind of one %. Um.
  Speaker 1
  And spotifi is kind of democratized the industry,
  Speaker 2
  because now, i think he said, there's about a million artists making a good living from
  Speaker 1
  spotifi. And when i heard that, i would like, honestly,
  Speaker 2
  i would rather make less money and have just like a decent living,
  Speaker 1
  am
  Speaker 2
  then have more artists to be able to have that, even though i wish it could include everyone. But that's really hard to argue with. You twu is the same is yu tubes mission. They want to basically have as many creators as possible d make a living, some kind ofye and
  Speaker 1
  that that's so hard to argue with its. But i think there's better ways to do it. My manager, i actually wish he was here, like woat would have brought him. My manager is building an ap that m can manage

  likead andle and and legal. It can read the apes building, can read your acton like, tell you about it. Because
  Speaker 1
  one of the issues of music right now, it's not that we're not getting paid enough, but it's that the rt art industry is filled with middlemen, because artists are not good at business. And, you know, from the beginning, like franksanastra, it's all mob stuff, like, it's the music industry a, you know, is run by business people, not the artists. And the artists really get small cuts of, like, what they make. And so, um, i think part of he reason i'm a technocrat, which, i mean, your friends are going to be technocrats, so no one', they're not goin to be mad ot me about this. But, like, my friends hate it when i say this kind of thing. Or
  Speaker 2
  the general public te ont like technocrats. They don't like technocrats, like,
  Speaker 1
  wodnt mean, when i watched am battle angel alida, and they were like, the martian technocracy. And i was liy, martian technocracy. And then they were like, and they're evil. And i was, oh,

- How Did Being a Mother Change A Human Being?
  Summary:
  "I think it's just so trippy watching consciousness emerge," she says of motherhood. "It's like the craziest science fiction novel you could ever read." She also believes that being a mother makes her more creative.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Would you say, i
  Speaker 1
  think it's just realy real orient my priorities. And at first i was really fighting against that, because i somehow felt it was like a failure of feminism or something like. I felt like it was like bad if, like, my kids started mattering more than my work. Am and then ke, more recently, i started sort of analyzing that a thought in myself, and being like, that's also kind of a construct. It's like we've just yevalued motherhood so much in our culture that, like, i
  Speaker 2
  feel guilty for
  Speaker 1
  caring about my kids more than i care about my work. So feminism
  Speaker 2
  includes breaking out of whatever the construct is. So, yes, continually breaking s freedom empower you to be free. And that means
  Speaker 1
  butbut it also like being
  Speaker 3
  a
  Speaker 2
  mother, like, i'm so much more creative. Like, i cannot believe the massive amount of great brain growth. Buti d you think that is just caust like the stakes are higher. Somehow. I
  Speaker 1
  think it's, like, it's just so trippy watching consciousness emerge. It's just like it's like going on crazy
  Speaker 2
  journey or something. It's like the craziest science fiction novel you could ever read. Is just so crazy, watching consciousness
  Speaker 1
  come into being. And then at the same time, like, you're forced to
  Speaker 2
  value your time so
  Speaker 1
  much. ([Time 0:49:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1540c6f4-b72e-47b8-a534-a79ddebdda85))
- Art should be Optimistic. Are We Going to End Up With Blade Runner?
  Summary:
  Having kids just makes you want to be an optimist so bad that i feel moral responsibility to make more optimistic things. I get a lot of shit for it, ecause everyone's like, you're so privileged. But if we don't ideate about futures that could be good, we won't be able to get them. If everything is blade runner, then we're going to end up with blad runner. We really need more protopian or utopian art. Am, i think this is incredibly essential for the future of humanity.

  world. And it was just, like, it was like dark, and it was like a study in villainy, and it was sortf just like, like,
  Speaker 1
  i, you still, i have no problem just making cynical,
  Speaker 2
  angry, scary art,
  Speaker 1
  uh. And not that there's anything wrong with that, but
  Speaker 2
  i think having kids just makes you such an optimist. It just inherently makes you want to be an optimist so bad that, like, um, like, i feel moral responsibility to make more optimistic things.
  Speaker 1
  And i get a lot of shit for it, ecause everyone's like, you're so privileged. Stop talking about like, pie in the sky, stupid concepts and and focus on, like, the now. But it's like, a, i think if we don't ideate about, um,
  Speaker 2
  futures that could be good, we
  Speaker 1
  won't be able to get them. If everything is blade runner, then we're going to end up with blad runner. It's like, as we
  Speaker 2
  said earlier, life imitates art, like, life really does imitate art. And
  Speaker 1
  so we really need more protopian or utopian art. Am,
  Speaker 2
  i think this is incredibly essential for a the future of humanity. And i think the a, the current discourse where
  Speaker 1
  am that's sen as a, thinking about protopia,
  Speaker 2
  utopia is seen as a dismissal of the problems that we currently have. I think that is an
  Speaker 1
  incorrect mind set. Am, and
  Speaker 2
  like, having kids just
  Speaker 1
  makes me want to imagine amazing futures that, like,
  Speaker 2
  maybe i won't be able to build, but they will be able to build if they want to. ([Time 0:51:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0f9cc3bd-ec86-4a30-96fa-8381c1787d19))

- The Switch to Intelligent Design and Choose Nonviolence 
  Summary:
  "I don't think we can eradicate violence from our species, because i think we need it a little bit," he says. "We can choose to really reorient our primitive brains that are fighting over scarcity and fight and ind am, that are so attack orientednd." He also criticizes the internet for not having student dets or job qualifications. 'You just take tests when you apply for a job, and if you're qualified, then you can work therethe i tis dislike, now, this, i don't know how anything works'

  Speaker 3
  now,
  Speaker 2
  this, i don't know how anything works. I'm just randomly ranting, but, ah, i like the humility. Ah, you youve got to think from just basic first principles, like, what what is the problem? What's broken? What are some ideas? That's it. And get excited about those ideas, and share your excitement, and don't tear each other down. Like, it's
  Speaker 1
  just, when you kill things, you often end up killing yourself, like, war. War is not a one sided lik, you're nt going t goin and just kill them, like, you're going to get stabbed. It's like, and i think hat, when i talk about this nextus, point of em that we're in, this a point in society where we're switching to intelligent design. I think part of our switch to intelligent design is that we need to choose non violence. And we need to, like, i think we can choose to start. I don't think we can eradicate violence from our species, because i think
  Speaker 2
  we need it a little bit. But i i think we can choose to really reorient our primitive brains that are fighting over scarcity and fight and ind am, that are so attack orientednd, and move into

  after watching totera. And he wants to watsh it all the time. And i was like, man, why isn't there an industry of this? Like, why aren't our best artists focusing on making art, like
  Speaker 2
  for
  Speaker 1
  the birth of consciousness? Like an a n, that's one of th things i've been thinking i really want to start doing. You know, i don't want to speak before i do things too much, but like, like, i i'm just like, ages one to three, like we should be putting so much effort into that. And the other thing about totero is, it's like,

  Speaker 2
  um surrounding the emergence of silicon valley. Like, i think they're, like,
  Speaker 1
  a lot of things were very irresponsible during that time. And, um, you know, like even just this, this current whole thing with twitter and everything, it's like, like, there has been a lot of negative outcomes from, ah, the sort of technocracy
  Speaker 2
  boom. But,
  Speaker 1
  ah, one of the things that's happening is that, like, it's alienating people from wanting to care about technology. And i actually think technology is probably some of the better, probably the best. I think we can fix a lot of our problems more easily with technology than with a, you know, fighting the powers that be, as, you know, not to go back to the star warsor that buck mister fler. Let's

- Finding the Happy Medium And epistemic modesty
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  history. Yes, itsand it's like we're in this really weird middle ground where it's like we are not finding the happy medium between mis wisdom and
  Speaker 2
  fresh ideas, and they're fighting each other. And it's like like really, like
  Speaker 1
  what we need is like, like
  Speaker 2
  the fresh ideas and the wisdom to be like collaborating. And it's like what the fighting, in a way, is the searching for the happy medium. And in a way, maybe we are finding the happy medium. That maybe that's what the happy medium looks like. And for a i systems, there has to be its. You know that yo reinforcement learning, you have the a dance between exploration, exploitation, sort of doing crazy stuff to see if there's something better than what you think is the optima, and then doing the optimal thing, and dancing back and forth from that, you would a sea rustle enough. You know, that is a ai guy with a thinks about sort of coto control, superintelligent ai systems. And his ideais that we should inject uncertainty and sort of humility into ai systems, that they never, as they get wiser ad wiser and wiser and more intelligent, they're never really sure. They always doubt themselves. And in some sense, when you think of young people, that's a mechanism for doubt. It's like how society doubts whether the thing it has converged towards is the right answer. So that the voices of the young people is a society asking itself a question, the way i've been doing stuff for the past 50 years, maybe it's the wrong way. And so you can have all of that within one a i system. ([Time 1:42:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4ce33edb-9103-43a0-b639-1bde06c4f62f))

I have al these faked twitter accounts where i like gointo different algarythmic bubbles to try to, like, understand. I'll keep getting in fights with people and realize we're not actually fighting.

  Speaker 2
  we kind all got fed the same thing, so we were all speaking the same cultural language. But

And we're like punishing each other for not using the correct verbiage. And we're completely misunderstanding, like, people are just like misunderstanding what the other people are saying. And klike, i just got in a fight with a friend am, about like, anarchism and and and communism and ship for like two hours.

What do you make of the fact you mentioned rise and fall of the third rike? I just, you read that. Read it twice. And so read it twice.

  Speaker 3
  tried really hard for this to not happen. People
  Speaker 1
  tried, they almost reinstated a monarchy at one point to try to stop this from happening. Like they almost, like,
  Speaker 2

At least, the way makes me feel is that there's a bunch of small moments on which history can turn, yes, like small meetings, yes, human interactions. And that's both terrifying and inspiring, ecause it's like, ah, even just attempts at assassinating hitler, like time and time again, failed, and they will sak falkry.

- The Role of Leaders to Stand Up to Evil
  Summary:
  There's a bunch of small moments on which history can turn, yes. And that's both terrifying and inspiring,. Even just attempts at assassinating hitler, like time and time again, failed. We tend to, you know, and modern discourse kind of call people evil too quickly. I think one of the things we've been successfully doing in our slow move from survival fof the fittest to intelligent design, is we've kind of been eradicating like, you look like ancient assyria and stuff like that.

- There are lots of Hitlers (the norm). We just usually stop them
  Summary:
  We've designed mechanism tatd lessen and lessen the capability for the destructive athere. We're trying to go country by country, like we're moving past this. But i stil think we're at high, high risk for it. I tink that's one of the big, the big risks, right? So inate natural state of being for humans is for there be a lot of hitlers,. which has got really good at making it hard for them to emerge.

  Speaker 1
  And then,
  Speaker 2
  um, we sort of, like recovered from the bronze age
  Speaker 1
  age collapse.
  Speaker 2
  Empire re emerged, writing and trade and everything re emerged,
  Speaker 1
  um, you know. And then we, of course, had the contemporary dark ages, a and
  Speaker 2
  then overtime, we've designed mechanism tatd lessen and lessen the capability for the destructive
  Speaker 1
  athere. There's o centrs to energeer. There. There's more recording about the the more contemporary dark ages. So i think we have like a better understanding of how to avoid it. But i stil think we're at high, high risk for it. I tink that's one of the big, the big risks, right?
  Speaker 2
  So inate natural state of being for humans is for there be a lot of hitlers, which has got really good at making it hard for them to emerge. We've got better collaboration, yes, and resisting the power, like
  Speaker 1
  authoritarians to come to power. We're trying to go country by country, like we're moving past this. We're kind of, like, slowly andcrementaly, like moving, like, moving to wards, like not scary, old school war stuff. And i
  Speaker 2
  think seeing it happen in in some of the countries that, at least nominally, are like supposed to have moved past that, that's scary, because it reminds us that it can happen, like, in an in the places that have made, like, moved, supposedly, as hopefully moved past that.

  this is the evolution of
  Speaker 1
  the little, literal universe herself. Like, we are not separate from the universe. Like, this is the universe waking up. This is the universe seeing herself for the first time. Like, this is a, the
