- Speaker 0: Obviously one of the things you really have to get right on keto is the electrolytes. Um Andrew Huberman, you should listen to his podcast called The Huberman Lab podcast talks about the importance of magnesium quite a bit. So this just takes out the thinking out of getting your magnesium supplementation right by going with the magnesium breakthrough. That's what I do because thinking is hard.

- Speaker 1: vision for tomorrow. He spent the 1st 11 of his 16 minutes describing the injustice of today as communication expert nancy Duarte explains, you have to show people what's unacceptable about what is before. They'll get excited about what could be as a job applicant instead of leading with what makes you a strong candidate start with what the company needs as a leader rather than opening with your vision, tell us what the market demands. 
  Speaker 4: There's actually very little data around couples therapy around couples who want to go to couples therapy. We had this moment of well we could actually go do that survey and we could go find that data. And so to be honest, that's the reason why is you we wrote this email before we realized that and before we started going out there to find the data. 
  Speaker 1: Have you, have you done that survey yet? 
  Speaker 4: It's in progress right now. ([Time 0:06:56](https://www.airr.io/quote/6282822a3782e70d24190a64))

But in a study of a business plan competition, the amount of passion that founders showed had no bearing on whether judges decided to fund their pitches. It didn't matter how much excitement they expressed.

  Speaker 1: allows us to develop 
  Speaker 0: to develop the division of labor, 
  Speaker 1: which would not be possible 
  Speaker 0: at any kind of sophisticated level without money. 
  Speaker 1: So 
  Speaker 0: If, you know, if we live in a small society of 10 people then think about all the things that we can make, all the things that we can produce. Uh if we're only 10 
  Speaker 1: people isolated from the world, there's 
  Speaker 0: only very few things that we can make and 
  Speaker 1: therefore um we can exchange those things directly 
  Speaker 0: with one another. 
  Speaker 1: But as 
  Speaker 0: you know, if we get in contact with other societies that have more people, then 
  Speaker 1: the opportunities for 
  Speaker 0: specialization increase. 
  Speaker 1: You know, there's 10 people. 
  Speaker 0: The only thing that you can make is 
  Speaker 1: the very basics 
  Speaker 0: you need for your survival. 
  Speaker 1: But if you're part of an economy 
  Speaker 0: Of 10 million people, ([Time 0:08:50](https://www.airr.io/quote/6282822a3782e70d24190a75))
- Speaker 1: In another study of over 1400 pitch videos, founders who showed too much joy were less likely to get funded. They weren't taken seriously and in a controlled experiment delivering a more animated pitch didn't increase the odds of success. But having a high quality business plan did, it's helpful to feel passion. But what you need to show most is preparedness. The most important step in convincing people to bet on you isn't to express enthusiasm is to prove that you've done your homework. Think about the most impressive entrepreneurs you've seen on shark tank or dragon's Den. They're not always the most entertaining ([Time 0:09:17](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e8663782e70d241fe121))

The most important step in convincing people to bet on you isn't to express enthusiasm is to prove that you've done your homework. Think about the most impressive entrepreneurs you've seen on shark tank or dragon's Den. They're not always the most entertaining presenters. They're the founders who know their numbers cold. It gives you confidence that they'll make smart decisions and be ready for any crisis in Jessica's situation. I wanted to see what her team knew about counseling or about providing ([Time 0:09:32](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e8693782e70d241fe373))
- Speaker 1: Think about the most impressive entrepreneurs you've seen on shark tank or dragon's Den. They're not always the most entertaining presenters. They're the founders who know their numbers cold. It gives you confidence that they'll make smart decisions and be ready for any crisis in Jessica's situation. I wanted to see what her team knew about counseling or about providing services to couples online, especially if they consider themselves one of the first to market. 
  Speaker 4: I guess I would pose the question to you. Like what would we have said besides a description of the team to ease that concern, 
  Speaker 1: what I can't see in your pitches, What do you know about relationship health? Has ([Time 0:09:53](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e8723782e70d241fe9d1))
- Speaker 1: a huge concern, privacy is a major issue. And there are all these open questions, right. That would have signaled to me is okay, You've identified a gap in the market. What I want to know is have you really done your homework and demonstrated to me that you're the team that's going to fill that gap most effectively. 
  Speaker 4: Yeah. So believe it or not, there were several versions of this email that we iterated on that we drafted and I think whether right or wrong in our minds, we said, let's just get enough info there to open the door. And at that point we thought that the external metrics of fundraising would be enough to say, hey, ([Time 0:10:47](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e8863782e70d241ff966))
- Speaker 1: that investors typically ask male founders about upside potential, how will you win? But female founders about downside risk, how will you make sure you don't lose. So for better or worse, a lot of advisors told Jessica that it was critical to express confidence. 
  Speaker 4: One of the things that really came across was this idea of be more confident means speaking in grand terms, 
  Speaker 1: I definitely had an allergic reaction to the best team in the world. I'm like on what standard, what are your data? I think I might have called it self 
  Speaker 3: aggrandizing. I 
  Speaker 4: clearly see how in writing that sounds very egotistical and I see that, you know, there's ([Time 0:12:54](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e8b73782e70d24202124))
- Speaker 4: and I didn't realize until just now how much pressure there was to feel like we have everything figured out and we have this plan and it's going to be really successful because there's a lot that we don't know yet. The second thing is it dawned on me as you were saying this, like we were emailing you to be an advisor and to get your advice and of course asking a question or showing where we have gaps is the best way to show you that we know that you would add so much value. 
  Speaker 1: Okay, I have to ask do you want to try your pitch again, 
  Speaker 4: I was afraid you would ask 
  Speaker 3: me that 
  Speaker 4: as you know, we have ([Time 0:18:08](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e9303782e70d24207cde))
- Speaker 4: year, Adam Liz Tyler and I and our team have piloted several different approaches to couples therapy and what we found is that this hybrid approach to couples therapy and relationship health, incorporating both the magic of a therapist relationship with their couple and the power of technology and content enables us to provide couples with proactive relationship health at any life stage in an effective and truly transformational way. Our model also helps alleviate the therapist capacity problem in the US by amplifying the therapist efforts and making their relationship with their couples ([Time 0:19:13](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e9493782e70d24208cee))
- Speaker 1: now pitching her to take me on as an investor and advisor. If you only have one shot to give your elevator pitch, it helps to lead with the problem before the solution, Focus more on signaling preparedness than passion and show receptivity along with confidence but what if you're pitching is part of an ongoing interaction like you want your boss to agree to a new project or your mentor to co author an article with you. If you have a whole meeting instead of a cold email, how do you get your ideas heard and if they get rejected, how do you revive them more on that after the break? 
  Speaker 3: Mm hmm. Mhm. 
  Speaker 1: Okay. This is going to be a different kind of ([Time 0:20:30](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e9683782e70d2420a107))

  Speaker 3: Mm hmm. Mhm. 
  Speaker 1: Okay. This is going to be a different kind of ad I play a personal role in selecting the sponsors for this podcast because they all have interesting cultures of their own. Today we're going inside the workplace at U K G.

- Speaker 1: And for the past 17 years it's become an annual list of Hollywood's uncut gems. Sometimes literally franklin has made a huge mark on the industry. The films he spotlighted have been nominated for more than 275 Oscars and won over 50 Including for the last 13 best pictures And 10 of the last 26 best screenplays. 
  Speaker 5: Slumdog Millionaire, The King's Speech promising young woman the year before that jojo Rabbit Argo and spotlight 
  Speaker 1: today. The blacklist also serves as an online marketplace where writers can get feedback and get discovered. So franklin has deep expertise in what it takes to make a successful pitch, especially when that pitch is ([Time 0:27:06](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e9fe3782e70d24211892))
    - Note: The Hollywood Blacklist
- Speaker 1: and impractical. An analogy can make them feel more concrete and feasible. In tech, many investors didn't get Airbnb until it was described as Ebay for homes in Hollywood titanic made a lot more sense to studios when it was presented as Romeo and Juliet on a sinking ship, although I still don't get why there wasn't room for leo on that raft. Franklin has found analogy is helpful when explaining his own vision for the blacklist. 
  Speaker 5: You're trying to communicate a series of ideas to another person. So if I say google for screenplays, if you know what a screenplay is great, if you know what google is great, you can probably put those things together and understand what I mean. Now if you don't ([Time 0:29:38](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283ea393782e70d24214540))

Now if you don't know what google is, that's not an effective analogy because then have to explain again what that thing is, but it's, it's ultimately about efficiency. You want those analogies to be specific and and evocative like I've used the analogy of like imagine trying to put together the Lakers roster but only from people that jerry buss personally knows or the people that he knows personally ([Time 0:30:02](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283ea423782e70d24214bac))
- Speaker 5: or that the thing that you're trying to do is dead. It means that you probably need to do it a little bit differently 
  Speaker 7: is a bit about reimagining the idea. But it's also about asking questions to help people think differently about the idea. So knowing what all the pushback is going to be, all the issues we're going to be and developing asking questions about, you know, how this would work, why it 
  Speaker 5: would work 
  Speaker 1: a second strategy is what franklin calls, re contextual ization, 
  Speaker 5: context changes. All of a sudden Hollywood knows this kind of movie works and they didn't have that information a year ago when the Hunger Games manuscript went out. I remember reading the book in manuscript form and being ([Time 0:35:35](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283eac33782e70d2421bb8e))
- Speaker 5: said, wait a minute. If you if you make these movies well you make a lot of money enter patty Jenkins is a wonder woman, enter captain marvel, enter any number of other female driven action movies that have come about as a result of that. And that is because the industry now said, oh wait a second, we have new information and we need to change our behavior 
  Speaker 1: with this new information. You're showing that what seemed impractical yesterday is practical today. 
  Speaker 7: Yeah, it is, it is, it's showing that what once was deemed unfeasible all of a sudden is actually doable. That's a huge kind of paradigm shift for people. You could ask yourself, can I think of a situation where I have seen this idea work, Can I personally vouch for this ([Time 0:36:38](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283eadf3782e70d2421d4cb))
- Speaker 1: a strategy, it seems like a lot of people hesitate to amplify other people's ideas, especially after they've been rejected because the thought is, well, I don't want to stick my neck out if that person already got shot down, this is a risk to my career. And yet I recently read some evidence showing that amplifying other people's ideas doesn't just help them get hurt. It also makes you look good. 
  Speaker 7: It does, it makes you seem like a team player, it makes you seem like you were paying attention and it makes you, um, you know, sound caring and concerned for others because this is not about me and what benefits me, this is me thinking about the team, thinking about the organization and if other people see it framed that way, it actually reduces the risk quite a bit to you ([Time 0:38:25](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283eb093782e70d2421f810))

  Summary:
  The amount of passion that founders showed had no bearing on whe judges decided to fund their pitches.

  You're absolutely right. It starts with the problem and then a survey of what's happening right now, and then a solution. And i can very much see why that's more compelling than just, we can revolutionize everything, right? And what i'm hearing is, why does this need to be revolutionized?
  Speaker 1
  Yes, i can see your pachet abo proving relationships.

  I think that that passion is what fuels need.

But in a study of a business plan competition, the amount of passion that founders showed had no bearing on whe judges decided to fund their pitches. It didn't matter how much excitement they expressed. The founders who got investments were the ones who were rated as thoughtful, logical and fact based. In another study of over 14 hundred pitch vidios, founders who showed too much joy were less likely to get funded. They weren't taken seriously.

  That
  Speaker 1
  brings us to a second myth. That a great pitch is filled with passion. I see this in so many founders. They want to electrify the room with their energy. But in a study of a business plan competition, the amount of passion that founders showed had no bearing on whe judges decided to fund their pitches. It didn't matter how much excitement they expressed. The founders who got investments were the ones who were rated as thoughtful, logical and fact based. In another study of over 14 hundred pitch vidios, founders who showed too much joy were less likely to get funded. They weren't taken seriously. And in a controlledx rment, delivering a more animated pitch didn't increase the odds of success, but having a high quality business plan did. It's helpful to feel passion, but what you need to show most is preparedness. The most important step in convincing people to bet on you isn't to express enthusiasm. It's to prove that you've done your home work. Think about the most impressive entrepeners you've seen on shark tank or dragons den. They're not always the most entertaining presenters. They're the founders who know their numbers cold. It gives you confidence that they'll make smart decisions and be ready for any crisis. In jessica's situation, i wanted to see what her team knew about counselling or about providing services to couples on line, specially if they consider themselves one of the first to mark it. I
  Speaker 3
  guess i would pose the question to you like, what would we have said, besides a description of the team, to ease that concern? ([Time 0:09:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a8b8536e-d5b9-4e44-9925-b8f3d62728d9))
- Don't Project Confidence, but Collaboration
  Summary:
  The key task in a pitch is to project confidence. Evidence shows that when people are considering working with you, they care at least as much about whether you're collaborative as whether you're capable. In her pitchy mal jessika did highlight the strength of her team. She said: We have the best team in the world to build a brand that makes relationship health accessible.

  So, believe it or not, there were several versions of this emal we iterated on that we drafted. And i think, whether right or wrong, in our minds, we said, let's just get enough in foe there to open the door. And at that point we thought that the external metric of fund raising would be enough to say, hey, we we showed all our astors that we have the chops, that we have identified the opportunity. In

  Which takes us to our third myth. The key task in a pitch is to project confidence. Evidence shows that when people are considering working with you, they care at least as much about whether you're collaborative as whether you're capable. And i've found that one of the ways to signal that you're collaborative is to talk about some of your shortcomings. It shows you're receptive to input and op to learning.

- Upside potential versus downside risk for male versus female founders
  Summary:
  The key task in a pitch is to project confidence. Evidence shows that when people are considering working with you, they care at least as much about whether you're collaborative as whether you're capable. It might sound like a lack of confidence, but it actually takes confidence to admit what you don't know. For better or worse, advisers told jessica that it was critical to express confidence.

And i've found that one of the ways to signal that you're collaborative is to talk about some of your shortcomings. It shows you're receptive to input and op to learning. You might do that by seeking advice on one of your drawbacks, sharing how you've grown from your mistakes, admitting some of your uncertainties or asking a question. It might sound like a lack of confidence, but it actually takes confidence to admit what you don't know. Of course, this is tricky for female leaders, who unfairly face plenty of barriers and stereotypes. For example, research shows that investors typically ask male founders about upside potential, how will you win? But female founders about downside risk. How will you make sure you don't lose? So for better or worse, a lot of advisers told jessica that it was critical to express confidence. ([Time 0:12:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9fde1e8d-f056-46f4-a5ec-5a84692b8da2))
- Confidence is Overrated And Humility Is Underrated
  Summary:
  All we talk about, in a lot of ways, is how to pitch more like a man. But i think that confidence is overrated and humility is underrated. I'm not saying you should come into the pitch and say, we are completely fied to be running this company. You've heard of impostor sindram but we are actual impostors.

  I have this group of female introupeters iam in many what's at groups,
  Speaker 5
  all we talk about,
  Speaker 3
  in a lot of ways, is how to pitch more like a man, and that that translates into be more confident. Yes, men might tend to do that more, and men are getting more funding, but it doesn't mean that, like one causes the other. And i think that was, i misinterpreted that and found kind of like a short cut to o be more successful is to speak, in this case, overly confident way. That decreases my credibility en.
  Speaker 1
  It shouldn't be your responsibility as a woman founder to have to figure out, ok, what kind of contortion act do i have to master to come across as appropriately confident, but not arrogant, and to show that i am warm, but not pollyanna? I'm
  Speaker 3
  s to hear like, how do you advise people on having that humility and being that gentle leader, or learning, open curious leader, admitting what i don't know, and also iffusing strength and credibility and inspiration? It's
  Speaker 1
  a really good question. I'm not saying you should come into the pitch and say, we are completely fied to be running this company. You've heard of impostor sindram but we are actual impostors. But i think that confidence is overrated and humility is underrated. I think that the kind of confidence i want to see is what read hoffman described to me once as confidence in your ability to learn, as opposed to trying to show that you've already figured it out.

  Very much makes sense. It kind of like makes my team more rigid than fluid.

- The Black List

  I
  Speaker 2
  was working for leonard de caprio's film and television production company as a junior executive, and my job was to find great screen plays when
  Speaker 1
  franklin, leonard was starting off his film production career. He read hundreds of pitches for the next hollywood hit.
  Speaker 2
  And most of the things that i was reading were not great. And around that time, i got a incoming phone call from a manager, i believe, who was pitching me on a movie. It would have been lenard caprio. I think he waesan esa oil industry lobbyist. And then he discovers that there is a a long dormant, though now active volcano in the atlantic, and a storm is going to pass over that volcano. The volcano is going to launch like toxic fume into the air, and this giant storm would destroy the entire eastern seaboard. I remember asking the manager, lake, are you pitching me leo ses the toxic super storm? And i remember him saying, well, when you pit it like that, it sounds ridiculous, en. I think i read mavy 30 pages and was like, yat. This is as bad as i thought it was. But
  Speaker 1
  franklin also read some exceptionally good screen plays that never saw the light of day. Eventually, he decided to email a bunch of hollywood insiders asking, what's your favorite unproduced screen play? Then circulated the list of their topics. That's when he founded the black list. And for the past 17 years, it's become an annual list of hollywood's uncut gems, sometimes literally. Franklin has made a huge mark on the industry.

- Making Your Audience a Partner in the Story You're Telling
  Summary:
  Research shows that when screen writers are handed ideas late in the process, their films end up being less creative and coherent. When they have a hand in developing the idea, they become motivated to invest in it. One of my favorite examples of that actually comes from apple. They said, yes, the smart phones for the pocket protector crowd are clunky, but how beautiful would they be if apple made one?

  Another
  Speaker 1
  strategy is to think of yourself as a pitcher. You're tossing a ball to a catcher, and you want them to throw it back. When that doesn't happen, things go wrong. Research shows that when screen writers are handed ideas late in the process, their films end up being less creative and coherent. They don't feel a sense of ownership over them. When they have a hand in developing the idea, they become motivated to invest in it. It becomes theirs. One of my favorite examples of that actually comes from apple. When the team finally got steve jobs interested in making a phone. It wasn't a full blown pitch. It was a half baked idea they tossed over that he could catch and toss back. They said, yes, the smart phones for the pocket protector crowd are clunky, but how beautiful would they be if apple made one?
