## Highlights
- Speaker 1: what if we started off sleeping and it was from sleep, that wakefulness emerged? Why do we assume that it's the other way around? And I think there's probably some really good evidence that sleep may have been the proto state, that it was the basic fundamental living state. And when we became awake as it were, we always had to return to sleep. ([Time 0:08:58](https://www.airr.io/quote/6131ec528c08ad000f63ab49))
