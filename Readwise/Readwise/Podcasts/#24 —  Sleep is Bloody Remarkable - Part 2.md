## Highlights
- Human Sleep Sticks Out Like a Sore Thumb (Shorter asleep and more REM)
  Summary:
  Human sleep sticks out like a proverbial sore thumb in terms of slumber. Compared to old and new world monkeys as well as apes such as chimpanzees and gorillas. We typically average around eight hours relative to somewhere between ten to 15 ous of sleep that we've measured in all other primates.

  Hiter, it's mat here again, and welcome back to yet another one of those quirky episodes entitled sleep is bloody remarkable. Nowin last such episode, we spoke at length about one a bloody remarkable thing called half brain sleep. Well, to day is all about the equally remarkable fact that when it comes to dream sleep, we humans are special. And i mean very special indeed. I'm even going to propose that this unique aspect of human sleep is one of many reasons that justifies our homined name. Because the term homo sapiens is derived from the latin root meaning wise person. And i'll come back to that in just a second, but let's return to sleep. Here is how we are special. Compared to old and new world monkeys as well as apes such as chimpanzees and gorillas. Human sleep sticks out like a proverbial sore thumb in terms of slumber. Or i should actually say two sore thumbs. As first, we are unique in the sense that the total amount of time that we spend asleep is significantly shorter than all other primates. We will typically average around eight hours relative to somewhere between ten to 15 ous of sleep that we've measured in all other primates. The second thing, however, is that, in striking contrast, we humans have a staggering and disproportionate amount of rem sleep, of dream sleep. Because if you look all other primates, if you average them together, will come in at around about nine % of the sleep time dedicated to rem sleep. But in humans, that number is somewhere between 20 to 25 % of all our sleep time being dedicated to rem sleep, dreaming.

- Sleeping in Trees Meant Less REM Sleep
  Summary:
  Sleeping in trees was an evolutionary wise idea up to a point. It provided a safe haven from largeg ond hunting preditors such as hyaenas. But if you become too relaxed in your sleep depth, it may be all the invitation that gravity needs to bring the rest of you hurtling back down into earth. This concern is especially true for the stage of rem sleep - which paralyzes your body and leaves you utterly limp. And it was this danger, the danger of sleeping high up in the trees, that put a limit,. that put a constraint on the amount of time that our primate, forbears, could gravitationally stay in this dangerous state of

  And you'd have to do that each and every night. Oh, my goodness. To me, that sounds like utter torture. That's the equivalent of furniture assembly pur tory in my mind. But let me come back to the explanation. Sleeping in trees was an evolutionary wise idea up to a point. Because sleeping in trees provided a safe haven from largeg ond hunting preditors such as hyaenas, as well as small, blood sucking anthropods, including lice and fleas and ticks. But here's the problem, if you're sleeping 20 to 50 feet up in the air, let's just that you have to be a tad curfl if you become too relaxed in your sleep depth, and, let's say, an arm or a leg will slide down or drop down, it may be all the invitation that gravity needs to bring the rest of you hurtling back down to earth in a life ending fall, and therefore popping you out of the jean pool rather quickly. This concern, this problem, is especially true for the stage of rem sleep. Because, as you will remember from our past podcast episodes, when you go into rem sleep, your brain paralyzes your body, leaving you utterly limp, a literal bag of bones. And it was this danger, the danger of sleeping high up in the trees, that put a limit, that put a constraint on the amount of time that our primate, forbears, could gravitationally stay in this dangerous state of rem sleet paralysis.

- Homo Erectus - The First Ground Sleeper
  Summary:
  Homo erectus was the predecessor of us, homo sapient. They were first obligate biped meaning they could walk freely upright on two legs. And we believe that it was homo erectus that was the first dedicated ground sleeper. With the advent of fire to deter large carnivore predators, and also the smoke from the fire, which pro ded a night time fumigation that repelled small insects, it enabled homo erects to come out of the trees and sleep safely at night.

  This concern, this problem, is especially true for the stage of rem sleep. Because, as you will remember from our past podcast episodes, when you go into rem sleep, your brain paralyzes your body, leaving you utterly limp, a literal bag of bones. And it was this danger, the danger of sleeping high up in the trees, that put a limit, that put a constraint on the amount of time that our primate, forbears, could gravitationally stay in this dangerous state of rem sleet paralysis. And this is where homo actus enters our story. Homo erectus was the predecessor of us, homo sapient. And homo erectus was the first obligate biped, meaning that they could walk freely upright on two legs, rather than mbering along on their hands and feet. And we believe that it was homo erectus that was the first dedicated ground sleeper. And with the advent of fire to deter large carnivore predators, and also the smoke from the fire, which pro ded a night time fumigation that repelled small insects, it enabled homo erectus to come out of the trees and sleep safely on the ground at night. Now, fire was not a perfect solution, however, ground sleeping would have remained somewhat risky. ([Time 0:07:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/10c03fd9-1ea2-4c8d-8e36-f64f9ba5523e))
