## Highlights
- Speaker 2: wow, this is how you do it. There's something about being original, there's a value to that, that I can continue to develop. That's what took me into the path of being a musician. The fact that I could make it my own, if I could make it my own. That's what really drew me in. 
  Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about that skill of being original. I have a former student Justin bourque who is now a stanford professor who just finished a study on one hit wonders versus repeat hit makers. And he found that that one hit wonders basically started out with songs that were similar to each other and fairly typical for their time, which allowed them to take off early but limited the range over a longer period. And that the people who made repeat ([Time 0:12:53](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283f4a73782e70d242922c6))
- Speaker 2: work really hard on it and you work on the skills and you work really hard to be able to execute. But then when you get inspiration and you want to capture a moment, the moment is all there is. You can't make it be anything more and less than what it is. 
  Speaker 1: Well, clearly I need to spend more time listening to the moment. I'm normally trying to force my plan into whatever moment is free on my calendar. 
  Speaker 2: Man. I I feel you, I feel you. It's a practice. I'm not the one to say that that doesn't work either because sometimes that works. But I do believe in the power of the moment overall and if I can stay in the moment, everything will be great. That's something that's really hard for young musicians to learn that.

I always try to teach. That's the only thing. Play the moment, that's it. And if you do that, then it has the opportunity ([Time 0:22:26](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283f5833782e70d2429c160))

If you've worked on the craft and developed it enough to actually execute that. 
  Speaker 1: I want to talk about one of the places where you get to work on your craft quite a bit, which is of course on Colbert, you have a front row seat to something that's really fascinating to people, which is a creative process in a different realm, which is comedy. And I'm curious about what parallels do you see between the comedic ([Time 0:22:49](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283f58c3782e70d2429c6ac))
- Speaker 2: the late Kobe Bryant on the show and it was a moment that made me realize that the full range of who I am as a person could exist in this role. I realized that there was room for my my whole being and by the way, steven is a genius because he's able to have that range himself as the host. 
  Speaker 1: You mentioned this range on the show and there was a moment a few weeks ago that I thought was profound. Andrew Garfield was on. And Stephen Colbert was asking him about the loss of his mother and he said that he started to see grief as unexpressed love and that he didn't want to let all his grief go ([Time 0:24:24](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283f5b03782e70d2429e3b1))
