## Highlights
- Speaker 1: hardness and the scarcity and choose this as money, but I think what's more important is just a natural evolutionary process whereby people choose all kinds of random things as money, bananas, maybe even, but then the people who end up making these bad choices 
  Speaker 0: don't end up with any 
  Speaker 1: wealth left, whereas the people who store them on their 
  Speaker 0: wealth in the things that 
  Speaker 1: are hard to make, end up acquiring, end up maintaining their wealth 
  Speaker 0: and maybe even increasing it over 
  Speaker 1: Time. And of course this culminated in the 19th century, in the end of the 19th century by the basically the entire planet being on a gold standard, what 
  Speaker 0: is the gold standard? 
  Speaker 1: The gold standard is basically when money is gold or 
  Speaker 0: at least government 
  Speaker 1: currencies backed by gold, but the reason 
  Speaker 0: gold ([Time 0:20:21](https://www.airr.io/quote/62826de13782e70d2409d125))
- Speaker 1: that are 
  Speaker 0: monetary. So 
  Speaker 1: this is the money, This 
  Speaker 0: is this is the official money that you should be using 
  Speaker 1: if you live in this country. Yes. Although I would say it's more like the 
  Speaker 0: other way around. It's not that the 
  Speaker 1: government's established gold as money. It's 
  Speaker 0: more like the 
  Speaker 1: it's more like gold gave the government's the credibility for their currencies. So governments were not the ones that made gold money. Gold has been money before States were invented. 
  Speaker 0: Um States, 
  Speaker 1: if you have a 
  Speaker 0: government and you'd like to have some 
  Speaker 1: legitimacy and you'd like to be able to deal with other governments on an equal footing, you had to go by the gold standard, you have to have a currency that was redeemable in gold 
  Speaker 0: so that you could trade with the 
  Speaker 1: rest of the world so that people could um 
  Speaker 0: in your country ([Time 0:27:01](https://www.airr.io/quote/62826e843782e70d240a4af3))
- Speaker 1: you 
  Speaker 0: can't smoke it, 
  Speaker 1: you can't eat it. 
  Speaker 0: It's just 
  Speaker 1: it's supposed to 
  Speaker 0: represent, it's supposed 
  Speaker 1: to just be the medium 
  Speaker 0: of exchange. And 
  Speaker 1: um in that 
  Speaker 0: sense, 
  Speaker 1: what role 
  Speaker 0: does collective 
  Speaker 1: hallucination 
  Speaker 0: play in 
  Speaker 1: the effectiveness of money? Exactly 
  Speaker 0: zero. 
  Speaker 1: Because all of the paper money, first of all, there's never been an instance. And again um This is uh flies in the face of a lot of what a lot of people like to think about money. There's never been an instance where a government came out and said, alright, we're printing out these 
  Speaker 0: pieces of paper, used them 
  Speaker 1: As money and this one is worth 10 apples or use 
  Speaker 0: it for buying things. 
  Speaker 1: And here's the piece of paper. This has never happened. They've always ([Time 0:33:58](https://www.airr.io/quote/62826e843782e70d240a4b1f))
- Speaker 0: it. If you're very stressed about some sort of information or a deadline or you're very, very excited about something, you'll find that you can focus instantly just within a moment and that's because of the deployment of neurochemicals like dopamine and norepinephrine that bring about our levels of alertness. However, most of us, including myself, will go to begin a work about and we'll find that our mind doesn't quite engage at the level of depth and focus that we would like right off the bat. I've timed this and other studies have timed this in a more rigorous way. Mine is just what we call an IQ data, but so I've timed it for myself. But there are studies that have looked at this and the data point to the fact that even at our most heightened levels of focus, most people can only maintain focus before switching tasks for about three minutes, which is depressingly short ([Time 0:34:36](https://www.airr.io/quote/628271c43782e70d240cef9a))
- Speaker 1: is one scientist to show that this relationship does not hold to do an experiment that shows that this does not hold and it stops being a law of chemistry and it's and it's broken where? Whereas 
  Speaker 0: in 
  Speaker 1: economics, what they've 
  Speaker 0: done is they've 
  Speaker 1: copied the superficial shape of this without any 
  Speaker 0: of the 
  Speaker 1: scientific rigor that was used to build it. There's no experiments. You can't experiment on economies. We don't 
  Speaker 0: have the ability 
  Speaker 1: to establish laws and all the laws that we 
  Speaker 0: established are just models that get 
  Speaker 1: people published and get them on the media to say, 
  Speaker 0: my model 
  Speaker 1: says we need to print more money, but it's never subject to actual scientific scrutiny. 
  Speaker 0: If it were, they would all be rejected in 15 
  Speaker 1: minutes ([Time 1:10:00](https://www.airr.io/quote/628272773782e70d240d70d8))
- Speaker 0: is unlike 
  Speaker 1: physics, you know, which is let's force a bunch of particles to sit in the lab so that we can study them 
  Speaker 0: in 
  Speaker 1: economics. You're forcing people to do things, you know, let's stop these 
  Speaker 0: people from doing this job 
  Speaker 1: because it's bad for the economy. And let's get them to do that job. Let's force them to pay this price. Let's tax them this much. Let's prevent them from using gold 
  Speaker 0: as money and force them to 
  Speaker 1: use our credit as money. So it has to rely on coercion. There's no central planning without coercion. And coercion is a crime, in my opinion. There's no way that it is justifiable morally 
  Speaker 0: or ethically from a politics, from an ethical perspective. Um, your view is the I mean, perhaps 
  Speaker 1: the broadly speaking to the 
  Speaker 0: libertarian view is 
  Speaker 1: coercion 
  Speaker 0: is unethical. ([Time 1:15:38](https://www.airr.io/quote/628272873782e70d240d7def))
- Speaker 0: Now, freedom is 
  Speaker 1: essential. What is what are the pros 
  Speaker 0: and cons of government intervention in 
  Speaker 1: the economy? So, 
  Speaker 0: can you steal me? Can you 
  Speaker 1: provide pros 
  Speaker 0: you just kind of 
  Speaker 1: provided arguments 
  Speaker 0: against? 
  Speaker 1: Is there 
  Speaker 0: any arguments to be 
  Speaker 1: made for government 
  Speaker 0: intervention for the 
  Speaker 1: role of government in 
  Speaker 0: society? Speaking from a political 
  Speaker 1: or from an 
  Speaker 0: economics perspective, 
  Speaker 1: what is a positive 
  Speaker 0: role of government that you 
  Speaker 1: can imagine, you can 
  Speaker 0: speak to. I can 
  Speaker 1: repeat many other cases, but I don't find any of them 
  Speaker 0: compelling for the reason that I 
  Speaker 1: mentioned, which is that 
  Speaker 0: ultimately they all 
  Speaker 1: rely on putting a gun to somebody's head and using the threat of force. So that's, for 
  Speaker 0: me, it can never be 
  Speaker 1: justifiable whatever the ends are. If the ([Time 1:16:23](https://www.airr.io/quote/628275753782e70d240fe98f))
