## Highlights
- General Factor (G Factor)
  Summary:
  In the vernacular, what i mean by intelligence is just being smart. If you want to do research on intelligence, measuring something that you can study scientifically is a little trickier. I really started with a charles spearman. He noticed when you tested people with different tests, all the tests were correlated positively. So he was looking at student exams and things, and he invented the correlation coefficient. And when he used it to look at student performance on various topics, he found that all the scores were correlated with each other,. All positive correlations. The general factor. B was such a funny word for such a fundamental human thing.

  Everybody
  Speaker 1
  has an idea of what they mean by intelligence. In the in the vernacular, what i mean by intelligence is just being smart, how well you reason, how well you figure things out, what you do when you don't know to do. Those are just kind of everyday common sense definitions of how people use the word intelligence. If you want to do research on intelligence, measuring something that you can study scientifically is a little trickier. And what almost all researchers who study intelligence use is the concept called the g factor, general intelligence and that is what is common. That is a mental ability that is common to virtually all tests of mental abilities. What's
  Speaker 2
  the origin of the term g factor? B was such a funny word for such a fundamental human thing. The general factor. I really started with a charles spearman.
  Speaker 1
  And he noticed, this is like a boy more than a hundred years ago, he noticed that when you tested people with different tests, all the tests were correlated positively. And so he was looking at student exams and things, and he invented the correlation coefficient, essentially. And when he used it to look at student performance on various topics, he found that all the scores were correlated with each other, and they were all positive correlations.

- The G Factor is the Most Stable and Survives Replication
  Summary:
  There is no replication crisis when it comes to studying the existence of this general factor. It looks like it's universal in that you find it in all cultures. Good scientists are a very intuitive they're not just he h, these are the numbers. There's a lot about research in general, not just intelligence research, that is poetic.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  We can't. There's a lot about research in general, not just intelligence research, that is poetic. Science has a pon aspect to it. Good scientists are a very intuitive they're not just he h, these are the numbers. You have to kind of step back and see the big picture when it comes to a intelligence research. You ask, how well has this general concept held up? And i think i can say, without fear of being empirically contradicted, that it is the most replicated finding in all psychology. Now, some cynics may say, well, big deal of psychology. We all know there's a replication crisis in psychology and a lot of the stuff doesn't replicate. That's all true. There is no replication crisis when it comes to studying the existence of this general factor. Let me tell you some things about it. It is. It looks like it's universal in that you find it in all cultures. The way you find it, step back one, one step. The way you find it is to give a battery of mental tests. What battery you choose? Take a battery of any mental tests you want, give it to a large number of diverse people, and you will be able to extract statistically, the common, the commonality among all those tests. It's done by a technique called factor analysis. People think hat that this may be a statistical art o fact of some kind. It is not a statistical art of fact.

- The G Factor is the Most Stable and Survives Replication
  Summary:
  Factor analysis is a way of looking at set of data and look at correlation among the different test scores. It's very hard to change the g factor with training or drugs or anything else. Don't know how to increase the g factor. Said a lot of really interesting things there. I'll get you.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It's done by a technique called factor analysis. People think hat that this may be a statistical art o fact of some kind. It is not a statistical art of fact. What is factor analysis? Factor analysis a way of looking at set of data and look at the correlation among the different test scores, and then find empirically the clusters of scores that go together. And there are different factors. So if you have a bunch of mental tests, there may be a verbal factor, there may be a numerical factor, may be a visual, spatial factor, but those factors have variants in common with each other, and that is the common ah, that's what's common among all the tests, and that's what gets labelled the g factor. So if you give a diverse battery of mental tests, and you extract a g factor from it. That factor usually accounts for around half of the variance. Its the single biggest factor, but it's not the only factor. But it is the most reliable. It is the most stable. And it seems a to be very much influenced by genetics. It's very hard to change the g factor with training or drugs or anything else. Don't know how to increase the g factor. I'll get you. Said a lot of really interesting things ([Time 0:13:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7f62e272-a5a3-4afe-af8b-00f5c3f7b8fe))
- G Factor = General Intelligence
  Summary:
  G factor is what we mean. So often, asa, this term used i c, which is the wayi i c is used. They really mean g factor in regular conversation,. Cause we what we mean by a cue, we mean intelligence. And general intelligence in the human mind, from a psychology, from a serious, rigorous scientific perspective, action, means g factor. so g factor equals intelligence, just in this conversation to define terms and get people used to it.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  there. So
  Speaker 2
  a first o get people used to it, in case they are not familiar with this idea. G factor is what we mean. So often, asa, this term used i c, which is the wayi i c is used. They really mean g factor in regular conversation, the way, cause we what we mean by a cue, we mean intelligence. And what we mean by intelligence woul mean general intelligence. And general intelligence in the human mind, from a psychology, from a serious, rigorous scientific perspective, action, means g factor. So g factor equals intelligence, just in this conversation, to define terms, i'l get. So, so there's this stable thing called g factor. You said it now, factor, you said factor many times, means a measure that this potential could be reduced to a single number across the different factors mentioned anda, what you said accounts for half half ish a accounts for half ish of what ofvariance across the different set of tests?

- Short Term Memory is Correlated with G Factor
  Summary:
  G factor is what we mean. So often, asa, this term used i c, which is the wayi i c is used. They really mean g factor in regular conversation. What else is there besides the raw horse power of the engine inside your mind that generates intelligence? There are test taking skills. There are specific abilities. Some people are much better than others. You might know people who can memori and short ter memory is another aa component of this. A short term memory is one of the cognitive processes that's most highly correlated with the g factor. All those things like memory, a taste, test taking skills, account for variability across the test performances.

So iyo do for some reason well on some set of tests. What does that mean? So tha, that means there're some unique capabilities outside f the g factor that might account for that. And what are those? What else is there besides the raw horse power of the engine inside your mind that generates intelligence? There are test taking skills.
  Speaker 1
  There are specific abilities. Someone might be particularly good a at mathematical things, mathematical concepts, even simple arithmetic people. Some people are much better than others. You might know people who can memori and short ter memory is another aa component of this. A short term memory is one of the cognitive processes that's most highly correlated with the g factor. Ah, so

  Summary:
  Each one of us has a g factor. are specific abilities. Someone might be particularly good a at mathematical things, mathematical concepts or simple arithmetic people.

  o, all those things like memory, a taste, test taking skills, account for variability across the test performances. But you see, you can, you can run, but you can't hide from the thing that god gave you, the genetics. So that g factor. Science says that g factors there, each one of us have. Each
  Speaker 1
  one of us has a g factor. Oh, boys, some have more than others. Getting uncomfortable already? Well, ic is a score. ([Time 0:16:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9a6f43cf-958c-480d-b884-19dcb2f43777))
- IQ Tests and G Factor (IQ Tests Allow Us to Estimate G Factor)
  Summary:
  Science says that g factors there, each one of us have. Each one of us has a g factor. You can't measure g directly. There's no direct measure. But an i c score is a good estimate. Why? Because a standard ic test is a battery of different mental abilities. That score is highly correlated with the g factor. Even if you get better scores on some sub tests than others,. because, again, it's common to all these mental abilities.

You can't measure g directly. There's no direct measure. You estimate it from these statistical techniques. But an i c score is a good estimate. Why? Because a standard ic test is a battery of different mental abilities. You combined it into one score, and that score is highly correlated with the g factor, even if you get better scores on some sub tests than others, because, again, it's what's common to all these mental abilities.

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You know, i get that a lot, about being uncomfortable talking about this. Let me go back and just say one more pirical thing. A, it doesn't matter which battery of tests you use. So there are countless tests you can take. Any 12 of them at random, extract a g factor, and another 12 at random, extracta g factor. And those g factors will be highly correlated, like over point nine, with each other. That very so it is ubiquitous. It doesn't depend on the content of the test, is what i am trying to say. It is general. ([Time 0:20:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0c73de86-0bdc-4d65-b0dd-3372aefc4dbe))
- Any Selection of Tests Correlates to G Factor
  Summary:
  There are countless tests you can take. Any 12 of them at random, extract a g factor and another 12 at random, extractsa g factor. Your skill at poker is not unrelated to g.

- What's the Relationship Between IQ and G Factor?
  Summary:
  An i ciss is a score. People use the word i c to mean intelligence, but i c has a more al meeting for people who work in the field. An i it's an ic score, a score on a test that estimates the g factor. This where there's a lot of controversy about whether ecu tests are biased toward any one group or another.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Ok, so what's
  Speaker 1
  the difference, if you can elaborate a little bit further, between i c and g factor? Just because it's a source of confusion for people, an i ciss is a score. People use the word i c to mean intelligence, but i c has a more al meeting for people who work in the field. An i it's an ic score, a score on a test that estimates the g factor. Ah, and the g factor is what's common among all these tests of mental ability. So if you think about it's not a ven diagram, but, ah, i guess you could make a ven diagram out of it, but the g factor would be really at the core what, what's common to everything. And i what i c scores do is they allow a rank order of people on the score. And this is what makes people uncomfortable. This where there's a lot of controversy about whether ecu tests are biased toward any one group or another. And a a lot of the answers to these questions are very clear. But they also have a technical aspect of it. ([Time 0:22:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7bb7ec96-53ef-44cc-9d15-33a20ed6c11f))
- IQ Doesn’t Scale (They Are Percentiles)
  Summary:
  Ic scores are interpreted really as percentiles, so that if you have an ece of a hundred and forty, and somebody else has 70. That would require a ratio scale with an absolute zero. Now you may think you know people with zero intelligence, but in fact, there is no absolute zero on on an icu scale. It's relative to other people.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Thit's
  Speaker 2
  not so easy to explain. Wet. We'll talk about the fas and the difficult things about all this, but a, so by the way, when you say rank order, that means you get a number, and that means one perso. You can now compare like a. You could say that this other person is more intelligent than me. Whatis
  Speaker 1
  a you can say is ic scores are interpreted really as percentiles, so that if you have an ece of a hundred and forty, and somebody else has 70, the metric is such that you cannot say, the person with an ece of a hundred and forty is twice as smart as person with an ece of 70. That would require a ratio scale with an absolute zero. Now you may think you know people with zero intelligence, but in fact, there is no absolute zero on on an icu scale. It's relative to other people. So rel to other people, somebody with an ic score of a hundred and forty is in the upper less than one %, whereasa somebody with an i c of 70 is two standard deviations below the mean. That that that's a different per centile. ([Time 0:23:41](https://share.snipd.com/snip/05d4c445-65cc-480e-aaab-0821b42966e8))
- Correlation Between IQ and Health / Life Expectancy
  Summary:
  In the 19 thirties, some researchers decided to get an ic test on every single child age 11 in scotland. Those records were discovered in an old storeroom at the university of edinburgh. One of the most interesting things they found is a very trong relationship between i c measured at age 11, and mortality.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  on? Anow, there
  Speaker 1
  are a number of statistical properties of any test, are called psychometric properties, yet, validity, you have ity, reliability. There are many different kinds of reliability. They all essentially measure stability. And icu tests are stable within an individual. There are some longitudinal studies where children were measured at age 11 and again when they were seven t years old. And the two ic scores are highly correlated with each other. This comes from a fascinating study from scotland. In the 19 thirties, some researchers decided to get an ic test on every single child age 11 in the whole country, and they did. And those records were discovered in an old storeroom at the university of edinburgh by a friend of mine, ean deary, who found the records, digitized them and has done a lot of research on the people who are still alive to day from that original study, including brain image ind research, by the way, really it's a fascinating groupof of people whor or studied. Ah, not to get ahead of the story, but one of the most interesting things they found is a very trong relationship between i c measured at age 11, and mortality. So that in 70 years later, they looked at the survival rates, and they could get death re sfrom everybody. And scotland has universal health care for everybody. And it turned out, if youd divide the people by their age 11 ic score into quartiles and then look at how many people are alive 70 years later, the i know this is in the book, i have the graph in the book, but there are essentially twice as many people alive in the highest ic quartile than in the lowest ic quartile. It just ruind men and women. Ah, interesthing. ([Time 0:25:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/430dd9ec-0915-4e38-9262-5a4296477824))

- Minnesota IQ Test
  Summary:
  A battery of tests to a diagnose personality disorders has been around for decades. The content of the items on that test are essentially true false items. Nobody knows why these items, in aggregate, predict anything, but empirically, they do.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  decades. I've heard this test recently because of the johnny de and amber herd trial. I don't know if you've been paying attention to that, but they a had acknowledged een paying attention hat thehad psychologists on theonthestand, and they were talking pantly to psychologist did a, again, i'm learning so much from this trial, that they have a, they did differentat a battery of tests to a diagnose personality disorders. Apparently there's that systematic way of doing so. And the minnesota one is one of the ones that there's the most science on. There's a lot of grade papers which were all nously cited on the stand which is fuss to wat was i a little bit of aca.
  Speaker 1
  And this is interesting, because you're wriht. It's been around for decades. There's a lot of scientific research on the psychometric properties of the test, including what it predicts with respect to different categories of person disorder. But what i want to mention is the content of the items on that test. All the items are essentially true false items. True or false. I prefer a shower to a bath. True or false. I think con was a better president than washington. What of all these? What does that have to do? The point is the content of these items. Nobody knows why these items, in aggregate, predict anything, but empirically, they do. It's a technique of choosing items for a test that is called dust bowl empiricism, that the content doesn't matter, but they're, for some ([Time 0:29:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2dc67023-7c95-494e-bf2a-d012d651c20f))

  Summary:
  i consider myself part psychologist, because i love human robot interaction. Half of that problem is a psychology problem. So designing these tests to get at the question is the fascinating part. When we talk about the items on an icu test, many of those items in the dust bowl empiricim method have no face validity. In other words, they don't look like they measure anything,. Whereas most intelligence tests actually look like their measuring some mental ability.

Nobody knows why these items, in aggregate, predict anything, but empirically, they do. It's a technique of choosing items for a test that is called dust bowl empiricism, that the content doesn't matter, but they're, for some reason. When you get a criterion group of people with this disorder and you compare em to people without that disorder, these are the items that distinguish, irrespective of content. It's a hard concept to grasp. Will fars a it's fascinating.
  Speaker 2
  But fora ecause i, i consider myself part psychologist, because i love human robot interaction. And that's problem. Half of that problem is a psychology problem. There's a human a. So designing these tests to get at the question is the fascinating part. Like, how do you get to a like, what is dust boll empiricism referred to? Does it refer to the final result? Yes, so it's the test, this dustboll empiricism. But how do you arrive at the battery of questions? I presume one of the things, now, again, i'm going to the excellent testimony in that trial, the explanation also, the they explain the tests a, that a bunch of the questions ar kind of make you forget that you're taking a test like it makes it very difficult for you to somehow figure out what what a
  Speaker 1
  you're supposed to answer, yes, calld, social desirability. But we're getting a little far afield, cause i only wanted to give that example of dust bowl empiricism. When we talk about the items on an icu test, many of those items in the dust bowl empiricim method have no face validity. In other words, they don't look like they measure anything,

  It's a little box, and there're a series of lights arranged in a semicircle at the top of the box. And then there's a home button that you press when one of the lights goes on. You take your finger off the home button, and you just press the button next to the light that goes on. That reaction time doesn't really correlate with icue very much. But if you change the instructions and you say, three lights are going to come on simultaneously. Your reaction time to that is highly correlated with the g factor.

  Speaker 1
  And it's not verbal at all. It's a little box, and there're a series of lights arranged in a semicircle at the top of the box. And then there's a home button that you press. And when one of the lights goes on, there's a button next to each of those lights. You take your finger off the home button, and you just press the button next to the light that goes on. And so it's a very simple reaction. Time light goes on, as quick as you can, you press the button and you get a reaction time from the moment you lift your finger off the button to when you press the button with where the light is. That reaction time doesn't really correlate with icue very much. But if you change the instructions and you say, three lights are going to come on simultaneously. I want you to press the button next to the light that's furthest from the other two. So maybe lights one and two go on and light six goes on simultaneously. You take your finger off, and you would press the button by light six. That's that reaction time to a more complex task. It's not really hard. Almost everybody gets it, all right? But the your reaction time to that is highly correlated with the g factor. This
  Speaker 2
  is fascinating. So reaction time sas the temporal

- Why There is a Time Limit on IQ Test
  Summary:
  Some of the best ic tests have a time limit. If you have no time limit, people can do better. So that adding the time element is portant. And reaction time is a measure of speed of information processing,. turns out to be related to the g factor.
  Transcript:

  So what wot woll be time prosing, it's the speed of processing. Is
  Speaker 2
  this also true for ones that take longer, like five, ten, 30 seconds? Ah, is time part of the measure wit some? Yes, yes.
  Speaker 1
  That is why some of the best ic tests have a time limit. Because if you have no time limit, people can do better. But it doesn't, it doesn't distinguish among people that well. So that adding the time element is portant. So speed of information processing. And reaction time is a measure of speed of information processing, turns out to be related to the g factor.

We'll find if you're really anxious during the test, the score will be a bad estimate of your g factor. Ye, it doesn't mean the g factor isn't there. That's at by the way, standardized tests like the s a t they're essentially intelligence tests. They are highly g loaded. Now, the the people who make the s a t don't want to mention that, for they have enough trouble justifying standardized testing. But to call an intelligence test is really beyond the pale. But in fact, it's so highly correlated because it's a reasoning test. S a t is a reasoning test of verbal reasoning, mathematical reasoning. And if it's a reasoning test, it has to be related to to g but if people go in and take a standardized test, whether it's an icute test or the s a t, and they happen to be sick that day with a hundred and two fever, the score is not going to be a good estimate of their g if they retake the test when they're not anxious, or less anxious, or don't have a fever, the score will go up, and that will be a better estimate, but you can't say their g factor increased between the two tests.

- College Admissions
  Summary:
  There are two ways to approach the very real problem that some people just get anxious, or not good test takers. Part of part of testing is you know the answeror you can figure out the answer, or you can't. For an individual to interpret your scores as an individual, whoever is interpreting the score has to take into account various things that would affect your individual score.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Well,
  Speaker 1
  let me say this, there are two ways to approach the very real problem that you say that some people just get anxious, or not good test takers. By the way, part of part of testing is you know the answeror you can figure out the answer, or you can't.
  Speaker 2
  If
  Speaker 1
  you don't know the answer, there's many reasons you don't know the answer at that particular moment. You may have learned it once and forgotten it. You may it may be on the tip of your tongue, and you just can't get it because you're anxious about the time limit. You may never have learned it. You may never, you you may have been exposed to it, but it was too complicated and you couldn't learn it. I mean, ther 're all kinds of reasons here. But for an individual to interpret your scores as an individual, whoever is interpreting the score has to take into account various things that would affect your individual score. And that's why decisions about college admission, or anything else where tests are used. Are hardly ever the only cri erian to make a decision.

- Why Use SAT With GPA
  Summary:
  It really comes down to which piece of information maximises your decision making ability. If you just use high school grades, itso k, but you will miss some people who just don't do well in high school. And the teir high school g p a isn't that good, so you will miss them. This is why you make decisions with taking in a variety of information.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  yes. And i it's possible, but it's statistically unlikely. So thatqu so it really comes down to to which piece of information maximises your decision making ability. So if you just use high school grades, itso k, but you will miss some people who just don't do well in high school, but who are actually pretty smartand smart enough to be bored silly in high and they don't care. And the teir high school g p a isn't that good, so you will miss them. In the same sense that somebody who could be very able and ready for college just doesn't do well on their s a t. This is why you make decisions with taking in a variety of information. The other thing i wanted to say, i talked about when you make a decision for an individual. Statistically, for groups, there are many people who have a disparity between their score in their verbal score. ([Time 0:46:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/049c9ae7-1086-4966-8772-a929b9a6c200))

The other thing i wanted to say, i talked about when you make a decision for an individual. Statistically, for groups, there are many people who have a disparity between their score in their verbal score. That disparity, or the other way around, that disparity is called tilt. The score is tilted one way or the other. And that tilt has been studied empirically to see what that predicts. And in fact, you can't make predictions about about college success based on on tilt. And mathematics is a good example. There are many people, especially non native speakers of english who come to this country, take the s a ts, do very well on the math, and not so well on the verbal. Well, if they're applying to a math programme, the professors there who are making the decision, or the admission officers, don't wait so much the score on verbal, especially if it's a non native speaker. Wells

- Intelligence Is Not Just A Number, But a Number Reflecting How You Navigate Life
  Summary:
  "Intelligence is not just an ic score. It's what those numbers reflect about your ability to navigate everyday life," he says. " personalitys all into that in some, in some, some deep, fundamental way."

  Personality is stable. Personality does impact the way you navigate life. There's no question.
  Speaker 2
  Should say that he g factor in intelligence is not just about some kind of a number on paper. It also has to do with how you navigate life, how a easy life is for you in this very complicated world. So personalitys all into that in some, in some, some deep, fundamental way. But
  Speaker 1
  now you have hit the key point about why we even want to study intelligence. Inpersonality, i think, to a lesser extent, but that's my interest. It is more on intelligence. I went to graduate school and wanted to study personality, but that's kind of another story, how i got kind of shifted from personality research over to intelligence research. Because it's not just a number. Intelligence is not just an ic score. It's not just an s a t score. It's what those numbers reflect about your ability to navigate everyday life.

And pretty smart people by and large, have enormous difficulty understanding what the world is like for people with eyecues of 80 or 75. It is a completely different everyday experience, even it t scores of 85, 90. You know, there's a popular television programme judge judy whi. Judge judy deals with everyday people with every day problems. And you can see the full range of problem solving ability demonstrated there. And sometimes she does it for laughs, but it really isn't funny, because people who who ar are there are people who are very limited in their life navigation, let alone success, by having by by not having good reasoning skills, which cannot be taught. We know this, by the way, because there are many efforts, you know, the united states military, which excels a training people. Ii don't know that there's a better organization in the world for training diverse people. And they won't take people with ecues under, i think 83 is the cut off, because they have found they are unable to train people with lower e use to do jobs in the military. So

  Speaker 2
  No, it's just intuitively, i i can see that life becomes easier at the lower end, yet if it's increased, it becomes less and less, it is an empirical, scientific question, but it becomes less and less obvious to me that more intelligence is better at
  Speaker 1
  the high end. It not because it would make life easier, but it would make whatever problems you're working on more solvable. And if you are working on artificial inte ence, there is a tremendous potential, too good for for that to improve society, i

It has a statistical analyses of very large data bases that show that, essentially, i c scores, or their equivalent, are correlated to all kinds of social problems and social benefits. And that in itself, is not where the controversy about that book came. The controversy was about one chapter in that book, and that is a chapter about the average difference in mean scores between black americans and white americans. And these are the terms that were used in the book at the time, and are still used to some extent. A and historically, really for decades, a it has been observed that disadvantaged groups score, on average, lower than caucasians on on academic tests, tests of mental ability, and especially on ec tests. And the difference is about a standard deviation, which is about 15 points, which is a substantial difference. ([Time 1:07:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a40a41c7-2582-4095-a7ec-e2728421a53a))

And they found the most predictive variables of education outcome were the variables the student brought with him or her into the school, essentially their ability. And that when you com ind the school and the teacher variables together, the quality of the school, the funding of the school, the quality of the teachers their education, you put all the teachers in school variables together, it barely accounted for ten % of the variants. And this has been replicated? Now no. So the best research we have shows that school variables and teacher variables together account for about ten % of student academic achievement.

Those are two different things here. And now we have if you work hard, you can be anything you want to be. This is completely unrealistic. I'm sorry, it just is. Now, you can work hard and be successful, there's no question. But you know what? I could work very hard, and i am not going to be cessful a theoretical physicist. I'm just not

- Genetic Influence on Intelligence and Flynn Effect
  Summary:
  The flin effect can affect the non genetic aspects of intelligence, because jeans account for maybe 50 % of the variants. The scale of natural selection is much, much longer than a couple of decades ago. It's been used to try to undermine the idea that there can be genetic influence on intelligence. But certainly it can be.
  Transcript:

  And this
  Speaker 1
  has presented intelligence researchers with a great mis two questions. First, is it effect on the 50 % of the variants that's the g factor, or on the other 50 %? And there is evidence that it is a g factor effect. And second, what on earth causes this? And doesn't this mean intelligence and g factor cannot be genetic because the scale of natural selection is much, much longer than a couple of decades ago. And so it's been used to try to undermine the idea that there can be genetic influence on intelligence. But certainly it can be. The flin effect can affect the non genetic aspects of intelligence, because jeans account for maybe 50 % of the variants. Maybe higher, could be as high as 80 % for adults, but that's just say 50 % for discussion. ([Time 1:59:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7288c34f-79c8-42fe-86f6-d99ed8f5e040))

Maybe higher, could be as high as 80 % for adults, but that's just say 50 % for discussion. Ah, so the flinn effects, it's still a mysterys. Still a mystery. Its still a mystery, although the evidence is coming out. I told you before, i edited a journal on intelligence, and we're doing a special issue in honor of james flynn. So i'm starting to see papers now in really the latest research on this a. I think most people who specialize in this area of trying to understand the flynn effect are coming to the view, based on data, that it has to do with advances in nutrition and health care.

  Ha, the etisit ofa variance can you apportion to either? Ye, most of the people who work in this field say that is the framing of that. If the question is framed that way, it can't be answered. Because nature and nurture are not two independent influences. They interact with each other. And understanding those interactions is so complex that many behaviora geneticists say it is, to day impossible, and always will be impossible, to disentangle that, no matter what kind of advances there are in dna technology and genomic inpormatic informatics.

But pre pre kinder, it's always an infinite well, maybe we didn't get it right, but after decades of trying, 50 years, 50 or 60 years of trying, surely some in would have worked to the point where you could actually see a result, and not need a a probability level at point o five on some means. So that's why i i that's the kind of evidence that would change my mind.

  and they grow up in another family, and you find out when those adopted kids are adults, their ic scores don't correlate with the i c scores of their adoptive parents, but they do correlate with their icue scores of their biological parents, whom they've never met. I mean, these are important. These are powerful observations. And

- Why Number of Books in a House Is Correlated to Intelligent Children
  Summary:
  More intelligent people have more books in their house. If you're more intelligent, and there's a genetic component to that, the child will get those geans, or some of those geans,. as well as the environment. But it's not the number of books in the house that actually directly impacts the child.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Is there data on the intelligence the ic of parents as
  Speaker 1
  it relates to the children? Yes. And there is some evident genetic evidence of kind ofr of of an interaction between the parents, ice and the environment. Tha hih icu, parents provide an enriched environment, which then can impact the child, in addition to the genes its that environment. So there there are all these interactions that, you know, ah, but it's not, you know, think about the number of books in a household. This was a variable that's correlated with i cd, and it is, yes. Well, wat, well, why? Especially if the kid never reads any of the books, it's because more intelligent people have more books in their house. And if you're more intelligent, and there's a genetic component to that, the child will get those geans, or some of those geans, as well as as the environment. But it's not the number of books in the house that actually directly impacts the child.

A aha, ha a a aa, prolems like a walk together holding hands, kind of kind of kind of idea. You may not know this, but i did some of the early research on anaesthetic drugs with brain image, trying to answer the question, what part of the brain is the last to turn off when someone loses consciousness? And is at the first part of the brain to turn on when consciousness is regained. And i was working with an anesthesiologist named mike alkir, who was really brilliant at this. These were really the first studies of a brain imaging a using positronmission tomography, long before a f mri. And you would inject a radioactive sugar that labelled the brain. And the harder the brain was working, the more sugar it would take up, and then you could make a picture of glucose use in the brain. And we he, he was amazing. He managed to do this in normal volunteers. He brought in and anatnotized as if they were going into surgery. Ah, he managed all the human subjects qirements on this research. And it was even brilliant at this. And, and what we did is, we had these normal volunteers come in on three occasions. On one occasion, he gave them enough anaesthetic drug so they were a little drowsy. And on another occasion, they came in and he fully anatmotized them. And, you know, he would say, you know, mike, an, can you hear me? And the person would say, a yees. And then though we would scan people under and under no anaesthetic conditions, the same person. And we were looking to see if we could see the part of the brain turn off. He sub uenly tried to do this with ampamara, which has a faster time resolution, and you could do it in real time as the person went under and then regain consciousness wher you couldn't do that with pet ye ta vry ret te aent.

So to this day, that the the simple question, does it take more anaesthetic drug to put someone under if they have a high e cue? Or less or less? It could go either way beause our early petskin studies of intelligence found the unexpected result of an inverse correlation between glucose metabolic rate and intelligence.

  So i don't lose my train of thought, i couldn't find in the text books anything about dosing by intelligence. I asked my friend, the anesthesiologist. He said, no, he doesn't know. I said, can we do a chart review and look at people using their s of education as a proxy for i c? Because if someone's gone to graduate school, that tells you something. You can make some inference, as supposed to someone who didn't graduate high school? O can we do a chart review? And he says, no, thy they never really put down the exact dose. And no, he said, no. So to this day, that the the simple question, does it take more anaesthetic drug to put someone under if they have a high e cue? Or less or less? It could go either way beause, by the way, our early petskin studies of intelligence found the unexpected result of an inverse correlation between glucose metabolic rate and intelligence. It wasn't how much a brain area lit up. How much it lit up was negatively correlated to how well it did on the test. Which led to the brain efficiency hypothesis, which is still being studied to day. And thereis more and more evidence that the efficiency of brain information processing is more related to intelligence than than a thenwith just more activity.

So like things we've never seen before, we're able to use that. I mean, that's, i've talked to a few people that design ic tests, sort of on line. They write, i coutest, and i was trying to get some questions from them, and they spoke to the fact that we can't really share questions with you, because part of the a, like first of al it's really hard work to come up with questions. I gess it's really, really hard work. It takes a lot, a lot of research, but it also takes a lot o novelty, generating your constanly coming up with really new things. And a part of the point is that you're not, they're not supposed to be public, that they're supposed to be new to you when you look at them. It's interesting, the noveltyis fundamental to the hardness of the problem, at least a part

You know things, but can you use those things to solve a problem? ([Time 2:35:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bb9ebde0-fdf7-43df-ab1c-b4ad0b7b8c4f))
- Fluid versus Crystalized Intelligence
  Summary:
  Do you think one day we'll be able to modify y, the biology of the genetics of a person, toa modify their intelligence? We started this conversation by talking about a pill you could take do you think such a pill would exist? Metaphorically? I do. And i am supremely confident that i's possible, because i'm supremely ignorant of the complexities of nero biologys. "I don't want to miss te opportunity to talk about the newr biology," he says.

  That's called fluid intelligence, as opposed to what's called crystallize intelligence, which is your knowledge of facts. You know things, but can you use those things to solve a problem? Those

  are two different things. Do you think we'll be able to, because we spoke, i don't want to miss te opportunity to talk about this, spoke about the newr biology, about the molecular biology of intelligence. Do you think one day we'll be able to modify y, the biology of the genetics of a person, toa modify their intelligence, to increase their intelligence? We started this conversation by talking about a pill you could take do you think such a pill would exist?
