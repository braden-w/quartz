  And so when you guys walk out of here. That's what you've got to ask. This whole theme of pivoting, this whole theme of keeping your centre, is about knowing what you want and believing you can make it a reality. But the only way to make it a reality is to put in the work. You've got to put in the work. The change is hard. The change is difficult. The change will demand everything of you. But man, if inside you really believe in what you're doing, you really see how you can get to that goal that you want, if you really see how you can serve other people doing you do with this skill set that you've worked your ass off to acquire, then you can actually make change in people's lives. And that's what motivates me. Getting the skills has real world implications. It took me from scrounging in my couch cushions to find enough change to put gas in my car to building a billion dollar business. It is absolutely limitless what you can accomplish. Now think about that. If that's really true, if what i just said is true, that human potential is limitless, then how you spend your time becomes a spiritual consideration. You're the average of the five peope you spend the most time with. That's just true. And but now it's become so common to say, and it's like every instagram post that i fear it's going to lose its meaning. Who are you spending time with? Because if you're spending time with people like you, you're spending time with people like me, i'm raising you up, or i'm just not going to spend time with you. So it's like, now, if you get in a mix of people like that, who are like men, we'd love for you to raise up to this level. But if you don't, it's fine, but we're just not goin tospend time with you. All of a sudden that desire to belong to something powerful that you can see is going to lead you to your dreams. And i remember saying to my wife over and over and over, they are the surest path to my success. I don't know anything else. I just know if i can hang on to these guys, they're going to make me better. And so that was through all the years of being embarrassed and developing, actually, massive anxiety, because i was always behind. I was always the dumbest person on the phone. I was always the dumbest person in the room. And it was like, was i going to be willing to emotionally go through that to get great? And most people can't. So here's a thing. Now, imagine i'm not the only person they said, hey, this is the start of m you know, any job you want. They i saw 12 people, maybe more, come and go over the years. B u. They just couldn't emotionally deal with it. And so i remember thinking to myself, why is it that i'm able to do this? And the answer was, i could self soothed faster than anyone else. So i would get kicked in the face and i would do something really dumb. I'd be called an idiot, told how stupid i was, and then i'd just be like, r i need to re center. And that just became my obsession. I need to be able to emotionally get back to complete neutral so fast that you don't even see it register on my face. How' you do it? How do you do literally practising. So remember, the same time, i'm reading about the brain voraciously. I'm reading about people that understand human behavior. I'm getting into cognitive science, noral science, like really going into it. So i'm reading all the stuff going wo we're just a chemical processing plant. There are physiological hooks into these chemicals. So hey, if you're ad, scared, whatever, but you force yourself to laugh out loud, you will change your neuro chemical state. And you literally, your experience is the neuro chemistry. So i like woe. So i could get i could be in a situation where 'm being beraded, or i legitimately mess up and it costs money, and it's like, woe. That's on me. And it is. Nobody's bad but my on. And i realize that what most people do, their strategy is to deflect. It is your fault, not my fault. Yes? So i started thinking of this as a metaphor. People are throwing gold at me. They're throwing it really hard, and i can put a shield up and deflect it, but then i lose that piece of gold. If i drop my shield and just take the pain, let it hit me in t head, then i bend down ad go this thing, which was me being ([Time 0:30:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/746db95f-4aa8-40b1-9441-7c8d0a96943c))
- Becoming So Good That They Can't Stop You
  Summary:
  When you have the skills, no one and nothing can stop you. Becoming so good they can't stop you. That's the greatest joy you're ever going to experience in life - being truly and uniquely yourself. Through a cruel twist of fate, the only way for man to really develop themselves is through suffering. And as ralph waldo emerson said, unless you try something beyond what youhave already mastered, you will never grow.

  Speaker 1
  What do you want badly enough to suffer for what price are you willing to to become the person that you want to become? When you do that, when you have the skills, no one and nothing can stop you. Really think about that for a second. There is a level of lity, a level of steel set where you can get so good at something, no matter how much people hate you, no matter how much they want to bring you down. No matter how actively they come for you, you can stand before them and say, i will not fall because you can out perform. It's not about convincing, it's not about politicing. It's about getting betterand when you understand that that is what the human animal is capable of, when you understand thut that's what you're capable of, everything in your life changes.

  a cruel twist of fate, the only way for man to really develop themselves and to become what they're capable of becoming is through suffering. It's by pushing yourself. And as ralph waldo emerson said, unless you try something beyond what youhave already mastered, you will never grow. But to push yourself beyond what youhave already mastered, is to really embrace tis. It's to push yourself to the edges of what you can take. It's to go beyond the physical, emotional and intellectual limits. It's about re defining who you are. ([Time 1:28:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5a90c7ac-05ed-4c1c-bf16-24b66a303c24))
