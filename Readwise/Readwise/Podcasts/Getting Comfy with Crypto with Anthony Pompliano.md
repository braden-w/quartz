## Highlights
- Do You Think Fiat Currencies Will Go Away?
  Summary:
  I do not think that the fiat currencies end up going away for my lifetime. What i think will end up happening is people will digitize them, and start to understand how to send Fiat value across the bit coin rails.

What i think will end up happening is people will digitize them, and will start to understand how to send fiat value across the bit coin rails. And so then all of a sudden you start using bit coin as a payment rail to send fiat currencies. And ultimately the digitization of fiat currencies will coexist with coin as additional currency. I just think that the incumbents are going to hold on for as long as they can. And similar to how bill gates said, you know, you cannot over estimate what you can do in one year and under estimate what you can do in ten, i think that we drastically underestimate just how long a government can hold on to a failing currency. And we also probably overestimate how quickly people are willing to throw their hands up with their existing currency and move over a hundred % to a new

  ni. Mean, look, there's an adoption cycle to everything, right? And if you would have asked, like i said earlier, three years ago, if youw'd have asked me, what's the adoption cycle? I would hve said, what adoption cycle? No, i don't get it yet, right? And nobody else gets it yet either. We are very obviously now in the adoption cycle, but that cycle takes a while.
