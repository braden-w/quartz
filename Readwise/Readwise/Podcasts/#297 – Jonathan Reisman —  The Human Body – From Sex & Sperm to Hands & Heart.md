## Highlights
- Is the Human Body a Feature or a Bug?
  Summary:
  I think that most of the time, the way the body works is the best solution. I haven't seen many alternatives, so it's hard to compare. But a, i think there's some parts of the body that make more sense than others. One thing i talk about in the book, there's some other body parts that seem to be lacking that kind of brilliant design.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Great question. I think that most of the time, the way the body works is the best solution. I haven't seen many alternatives, so it's hard to compare. But a, i think, you know, there's some parts of the body that make more sense than others. You know, the way our hands work, for instance. Ah, you know, the muscles are up in the forearm, and the tendons kind of come down likea strings on a puppet. And just the dexterity it gives our hands is just really amazing. And it's hard to imagine a better, a better tool than the human hand to do everything, from, you now, hold things, to play piano and do a million other daily activities that we do. One thing i talk about in the book, there's some other body parts that seem to be lacking that kind of brilliant a design, such as the throat. You know, where thea food drink are swallowed and air is inhaled. And they kind of, those two paths come within millimeters of each other, and you slip up once you laugh while eating, or you speak while trying to swallow, and you die from choking. So it seems less than optimal, though i'm not sure it could be better. From the way we're kindof formed in the womb as a beginning as the tiny little tube. I don't think it could have been done any better, or there's any other way to do it. But it is an unfortunate thing that ou kno, does lead to some problems.

- The Thumb, Is It Fundamental To Humanity?
  Summary:
  A lot of people think the thumb is foundational to a to human civilization. In most cases too, just daily life, and your ability to get around,. take care of yourself an others. So in that way, i do think the thumb, you know, does seem like the most important many ways.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So,
  Speaker 2
  the hand, if i could just linger on that for a second. Youd talk about the wisdom of a design in the book. What are the important things about the hand? It seems like very useful for many things, and it seems to be quite effective. A lot of people think the thumb is foundational to a to human civilization. Ah, is there any truth to that? I
  Speaker 1
  think that is true. Actually, one of the ways in which the importance of individual fingers comes to attention is when people have severe injuries to their fingers. For instance, i have a story in the book about a guy whose thumb is nearly ripped off by his dog's leash. And you know, when we when plastic surgeons, wo are often the ones to repair thatome the dorothopetic surgeons. They will debate, you know, how important is it to save this finger, or how important is it to save, you know, let's say, the kind of tip, the one third, the tip, one third of one of your fingers. You know, t depends on the length that you'll lose, it depends on which finger. And so the thumb really is them crucial a just, you know, for your occupation. In most cases too, just daily life, um, and your ability to get around, take care of yourself an others. So, you know, theye'll be more, they're willing to go further, do more surgeries, more aggressive therapy to save a thumb, let's say, a then, you know, the tip of your pinky fingers. So in that way, i do think the thumb, you know, does seem like the most important many ways. ([Time 0:08:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/284280d5-1f66-4140-8339-03a3ef996ca3))
- The Kidneys are a Underrated Organ
  Summary:
  The most obvious one is the brain, partly because it's so poorly understood. I would say that kidneys are an underappreciated organ. The way they tinker with the blood stream and our entire lives from inside the womb until we die was just really incredible.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yet
  Speaker 2
  maybe the roots of it makes sense, but the way propagates, especially as the times change, might not cause you could wash your hands. Ah, but the taboo remains. Rit society is very slow to change. What is the most fascinating part, function or concept in the human body? So youav something that fills you with awe? I
  Speaker 1
  guess the most obvious one is the brain, partly because it's so, you know, sort of poorly understood. Though we understor understand more than we ever have in the past, there's still so much that we don't understand about how the lump of matter in our skulls kind of creates this subjective experience that we all kind of understand quite this really. That's an easy one. I would say that kidneys are an underappreciated organ. Ah, they the way they tinker with the blood stream, raise levels of this, lower levels of that, kind of, our entire lives from inside the womb until we die, is just really incredible.

- Value of Blood Testing and Opiods Without Addictive Qualities
  Summary:
  Te thernos is a company that was basically started to revolutionize the way medical blood tests are done, both to use a whole lot less blood in doing it. You know, if anyone's ever been to the doctor and had five to ten tubes of blood removed from them, it can be quite surprising how much they take outd. In children we do draw much less blood. They have a much low blood volume, and we use these tiny little tubes to draw their blood. And we seemingly get equivalent information out of the larger tubes we draw from adults.

  Te
  Speaker 1
  thernos is a company that was basically started to revolutionize the way medical blood tests are done, both to use a whole lot less blood in doing it. You know, if anyone's ever been to the doctor and had five to ten tubes of blood removed from them, it can be quite surprising how much they take outd and it's, you know, that's the limitation of our technology, that we need those volumes of blood to all the tests that we want to and so the promise of theranos was that perhaps with a single drop of blood, we would be able to know as much about the persons, the condition of their body, and without drawing all that blood. And thereby, you know, there would be these devices she was going to create that would sort of do it, you put a drop of blood in and spits out thing you ever wanted to know about what's in your blood stream. And in a way, that would make it so much easier. You know, it could be, you could have one in your home, theoretically. And you i don't know why you'd wonder what your potassium level is on any given day, but you could check if you wanted to. Ah, and so that that goal is very worthy. You know, i put that goal up there with a the frontier of making pain killers that are as good as opioids, without the addictive quality. You know, that would be such a huge revolution if we did have that in medicine. But, and particularly for me, cause i trained in both pediatrics and internal medicine, so i learned to care for both children and adults. In children we do draw much less blood. They have a much low blood volume, and we use these tiny little tubes to draw their blood. And we seemingly get equivalent information out of the larger tubes we draw from adults.

- The Medium of the Craft (Blood, Feces, Urine)
  Summary:
  "I wanted to throw the reader right into the brutal honesty of death," she says. "When you trained to be a doctor, everything is on the table, literally in the cadaverle" The book includes chapters about feces and genitals as well as blood-spattered fingers and toes.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So i do think that things can leave a mark, but i don't think that initial cadaver would be the most dramatic,
  Speaker 2
  yes, but maybe some of that drama the demons make you a better surgeon, just like a some of your own psychological tromment might make you a better psychiatrist. Returning to the ordering, is it order is a chaos to the ordering of the chapter s from throat, throat and heart and feces and genitals, all the way to fingers and toes and blood. So
  Speaker 1
  i did mention that, you know, the throat was the first one, cause i kind of wanted to throw the reader right into the brutal honesty of death. And i followed it up with feces as the third chapter. And in a way, partly to also throw them right into the deep end of how i like discussing parts of the body and revealing their gross and fascinating aspect. So i didn't want to hide anything. You know, when you trained to be a doctor, everything is on the table, literally, in the cadaverle but also just, you know, you deal with blood and pis and vomit and fises, and that kind of the medium of your craft. And, yes, n, the medium of the craft, that's right. Right.
  Speaker 2
  Like, if you're a painterth, this is the paint youwe exactly. Andrn, then you have to create a masterpiece with it. ([Time 0:33:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2d41bcd5-a9c9-4ed3-b88e-79210c6adde7))
- Are We Just a Fancy Tube?
  Summary:
  We seem to be motivated by what comes out of the tube as well. Seemingly like we're also motering the functioning of the output. I think people have gone to wars over the put and maybe sometimes the lack of the output, or the desire for output with other humans.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  We are. And we sprout eyes and a brain and a sense of smell and taste, pretty much to regulate what comes in the front of the tube. You know, we don't want to eat anything dangerous, poisonous, you know, we want to choose what we eat, even choose who eat castl
  Speaker 2
  we seem to be motivated by what comes out of the tube as well. In part that's not just output. It's a feedback mechanism. Seemingly like we're also motering the functioning of the output. We're not just obsessed about the input.
  Speaker 1
  We're very obsessed with the output. You're absiutly right about that. Peopleo know, have medical complaints about their output. Very often. Thet are, you know, i'm never, i never cease to be surprised by a new kind of complaint or observation about the output. I think people have gone to wars over the put and
  Speaker 2
  maybe sometimes the lack of the output, or the desire for output, with particular other humans, a that yo, you fancy the brain and the eyes that sprouted somehow convinced the rest of the body that this one particular other tube is fanciful. So your going to go to major wars and lead global suffering because because of the fancy and the desire for additional output with the other a tube.

- Blood is Cycling about Every 5 Minutes
  Summary:
  The main function of the heart, basically is to push blood through the carti vascer system. To get blood to your brain, you need a certain amount of pressure to get it up there. They say every red blood cell takes about five minutes tor late and come back to the heart in order to mend circulation. The biggest disconnect between how organs talked about in poetry and through history versus is actual function is probably the heart.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I
  Speaker 1
  mean, the main function of the heart, basically is to push blood through the carti vascer system, through the branching blood vessels, to feed every cell in the body. You know, when r believe our ancestors started off as single celled organisms floating in some ancient brew, and they were surrounded by the medium that would bring them all the nutrients they needed, so there's no issues there. Then once you start getting multi cellular organisms, the kind that are thicker, and the ones on the inside are in contact with that sort of nutritious brew that they're growing in, ah, you kind of need a way to distribute those nutrients to every cell. And so that's what the heart and the branching vascular tree do. So the heart, you know, it's, it's the most, the biggest disconnect between how the organs talked about in poetry and through history versus is actual function is probably the heart, cause we ascribe all these things, love and passion and life itself, sometimes, to the heart. But actually, it's just a simple mechanical pump, you know, that's all it is. I don't wan to down playht, it's amazing, but, you know, it just pushes, it fills theth blood and then squeezes, it fills the blood and squeezes it. And just that squeezing, that pushing, creates the blood pressure that you need to blood to every cell in your body, especially when you're standing upright? To get blood to your brain, you need a certain amount of pressure to get it up there?
  Speaker 2
  Isn't it amazing to you how much volume of blood just gets pushed through by this, by this pump?
  Speaker 1
  Absolutely. They say every red blood cell takes about five minutes tor late and come back to the heart mend that circulation kind that, you know, starts in the womb and continues and kind of until the moment that we die. But the volume is tremendous, and it can never, you know, take a break, basically. ([Time 0:48:15](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8efd4417-18bf-4af1-a222-388db095bf63))
- Blood is the Most Important Medium
  Summary:
  Every cell in the body needs a flow of blood to bring it oxygen and nutrients. Blood is also used by doctors to evaluate the body. Every red blood cell takes about five minutes tor late and come back to the heart mend that circulation. It's sort of the fresh water and the sewage system in one so about blood? What? What use fastening about blood?
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Absolutely. They say every red blood cell takes about five minutes tor late and come back to the heart mend that circulation kind that, you know, starts in the womb and continues and kind of until the moment that we die. But the volume is tremendous, and it can never, you know, take a break, basically. And
  Speaker 2
  it's sort of a propagating all kinds of stuff throughout the body, t delivery ism blood for all kinds of good stuff and bad stuff. Nutrition, drugs, all
  Speaker 1
  that rate. Medications too, medications.
  Speaker 2
  Such a fascinating design.
  Speaker 1
  And it also takes the waste away, you know, it kind of brings the nutritious stuff, brings the nutrients, specially ygen, but many other things. And then it also, as it passes the cell, takes the cells waste. So it sort of the the fresh water and the sewage system in one
  Speaker 2
  so about blood? What? What use fastening about blood? So we talk about the pomp that spreads the blood, but the blood itself, right?
  Speaker 1
  So the blood itself is sort of, i mean, it's the most important bodily fluid. Of course. You know, from moment to moment, every cell in the body needs a flow of blood, a to bring it, most importantly, oxygen, but also, again, all the other nutrients and to take away waste. And if that stops for even a few moments, you can be in big trouble. Am. So blood is sort of, you know, the most important medium. It's also doctors use it to kind of evaluate the ([Time 0:49:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/414cb573-5b84-44d7-8d2a-de9e012dde0e))
- Is there a Difference Between the Penus and the Vagina?
  Summary:
  The penus and the vagina are very important body parts. The chemical reactions that create sperm function best at a few degrees cooler than body temperature. In cold weather, they scrunched themselves up to get closer to the body to maintain that ideal temperature.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Not us. Not us. Is there any improvements to the design? So a lot of people are very interested in these particular body parts. If you were to sort of step back as as a genetiis, biological designer, maybe a computer scientist, computer engineer, trying to build a human two point o, or maybe a robot, how would you improve the penus and the vagina?
  Speaker 1
  Well, the penus for starters. I mean, let's also discuss the testicle. You know, they're very important too. I mean, ce yes, ough, they're fragile and they're important, and yet they're hanging off the body, in danger, basically. So, um, does that make sense? You know, they begin in the womb, they begin inside the abdomen, and they slowly descend and n sometimes before birth, sometimes in the first year of sometimes never. They pop out of the body and an up hanging in the scrotum. There's a reason, because the chemical reactions that create sperm function best at a few degrees cooler than body temperature. And so that's why you might notice in the warm weather, they might hang further down, and in the cold weather, they scrunched themselves up to get closer to the body to maintain that ideal temperature a few degrees cooler.

- Artificial Womb
  Summary:
  In the mouth of certain balene whales, there's a similar kind of rectile tissue that helps cool them off. Because they have so much blubber and creates so much heat in moving around and feeding, it makes them too hot. So as a compensation, they have this kind of a rectile organ in their mouth. You know, tt be great if the uterus, where the growing foetus is a sort of even more protected from those things.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  But, you
  Speaker 1
  know, that's also a bit unique. I suppose that in other wayts, it has this rectile tissue, actually, they're similar. In the mouth of certain balene whales, there's a certain, similar kind of rectile tissue that helps col cool them off, because they have so much blubber and creates so much heat in moving around and feeding, that they have actually a similar, similar to the penist organ in their mouth that helps cool their bodies. Because it's a big problem. They have to store all that blubber for fuel, but it makes them too hot. So as a compensation, they have this kind of a rectile organ in their mouth.
  Speaker 2
  Ok, ah, what about vagina?
  Speaker 1
  You know, the fact that, a, miscarriages sometimes happen because of sexually transmitted diseases, because of drama. You know, tt be great if the uterus, where the growing foetus is a sort of even more protected from those things. A, you know, i guess that that's a side effect of the fact that people still have sex when they're pregnant. Are still, you know, exposed to injury. There is a way to make it more protected, perhaps that would be even better. I did see an article recently about artificial womds, which are rapidly becoming a reality. And in animal studiesh able to prolong the justation of a foetus by a month in an artificial womb. ([Time 1:01:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/73bd0378-c3c7-4b8d-9776-e535ac0299ea))

  you explain the artificial aspect of the artificial womb? Sure, it's a, i

  believeit it acts almost like a heart lung bipast machine. So when someone's getting like bipast surgery, their heart is stopped, literally, they throw ice in the chest, and they um give a potassium infusion through the blood, which stops the heart. Am, but the blood is run through a machine that basically does the work of the heart and lungs together, gets oxygen into the blood and then pushes it back into the body. So i believe it's a similar mechanism to keep blood and nutrition flowing to this fetus. Ah, and so it's just not inside the body of a parent, it's in some kind of other device. But i think that science is going to rapidly improve. One benefit is, you know, babies are born premature. ([Time 1:01:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b5e68c02-0af1-40e8-a9bd-70043990bfcb))

And a while, you know, neonatologyis able to continuously kind of lower the age of iability through better technology and understanding how what you can medicines and other things, you can do premature babies when they're born. You know, ideally, if, let's say, premature labor begins, you can't stop it, that baby's coming out one way or the other. If you could just then stick it into an artificial womb where it can continue its development, that would save a whole host of problems off. And those babies born very early suffer from damage to various organs, including the brain, ina, for the rest of their life. So that could be a very important technology. U

And it's not the fastest, so apparently there's some kind of slaughter that happens early on. People will correct me, but it's not the fastest. Theres a aspect of it's the luckiest. It really is, like the body tries to make it a random selection. They try to make it fair, in making it as random as possible. Interesting. And allso interesting that they're fuel by frut dose.

  Summary:
  War and medicine has a very intricate and complex relationship.

  Definitely.
  Speaker 1
  War and medicine has a very intricate and complex relationship. I don't know if it was walt whitman who said it, though he was a nurse during the civil war, that war is the best medical school. But some people have said that em and, you know, even advancements in medicine are come from war. You know, the wars in arac and afghanistan have, in some ways, really revolutionized certain aspects of the way we treat trama patients in the civilian world as well, the importance of tourniquits a, the importance of transfusing whole blood instead of, you know, red blood cells slated from serum and platelets, et cetera. The importance of pain control in the battlefield. That's changed dramatically, everything from kedamine injections to fenton e lollypops in the battlefield. So war has really improved medicine in many ways. In another way, you know, the department of defense spends alot of money on medical research and kind of really pushes the envelope, you know, darpa is a one aspect of the military budget that really funds these moon shot experiments that are really fascinating and really push ([Time 1:49:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/237a3aa8-ee4c-4573-9528-c9e273d46b1d))

- The Use of Laxatives Based Off the Aniquated Notion of Balancing Fluid
  Summary:
  Laxatives were used for a surprising number of ailments where they probably did not help at all. But that being said, they were probably not eating very high fibre food on the expedition so perhaps laxatives could have been helpful. You know, thoe's lot of seal, a penguin, and seal meat being eaten, which is not superin fibre. So i don't wan to discount the importance of laxitives in that setting, but that wouldn't be the essential thing. think the difference is unimaginably stark.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I
  Speaker 1
  think the difference is unimaginably stark. One thing i do want to point out is that the use of laxatives early in the twentieth century, and before that, they were used for a surprising number of ailments where they probably did not help at all. But i think that was hold over from sort of the old theory of medicine, the humoral theory, where you have to balance the fluids in the body, and so causing people to vomit, causing them to have diare or purposely taking blood out of them in blood letting was a big part. And i think the crazy use of laxatives was maybe a hold over from that time. But that being said, they were probably not eating very high fibre food on that expedition, so perhaps laxatives could have been helpful. You know, thoe's lot of seal, a penguin, and seal meat being eaten, which is not superin fibre. So i don't wan to discount the importance of laxitives in that setting, but

If i could just return to thit. you humans, your human attachment sex and death. if you just put more priority on the death than sex, well be, ah, better off. No, i would love to go to mars.

  you humans, your human attachment sex and death. If you just put more priority on the death than sex, i think, well be, ah, better off. No, i would
  Speaker 1
  love to go to mars. And actually, you know, i practise high altitude medicine, and a pall space medicine is sort of an extension of, you know, the air is just much thinner, like non existent, you know, as you go higher in the mountains, the things that happen to human physiology are very bizarre and strange and still not well explained by science. And in space, it's just like a crazy extension of high altitude.
  Speaker 2
  If i could just return to thit. We didn't really, i think we mentioned a little bit about the food you had. Just if a go high level, say, what is the greatest meal you've ever had? So your last meal, let's go. If one more meal, i get toa murder you after this. This is your last day. We got to spendit the where in the world would you go? What would you eat? I would say the most delicious thing is
  Speaker 1
  bone marrow. And i would love a full meal of bone marrow for my last, last dish. I did on my birthday in two thousand two at a kilogram and a half of crab meat and kamchatka. And that was also amazingly delicious. A the king crab, they have theirs, incredible a. But i would go with bone marrow, which is a, i think, just one of the most delicious ([Time 1:58:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d531221b-0bf0-4224-af6e-71c53548cc2b))
- What Do You Like About Mathematics?
  Summary:
  The shapes that you see ono the wafe action, just eating away at these pieces of ice. I mean, it's just like geometry. The geometry alone is amazing. And i also just love how it's sort of constant shedding from our antarctic continent, from greenland. You knotice this constant process of snow falling inland and pushing the glaciers further out to sea and them breaking loose.

  Speaker 1
  I think it's a few things. One is just the shapes that you see ono the wafe action, just eating away at these pieces of ice, you get these arches and just these shapes. I mean, it's just like geometry. The geometry alone is amazing. I studied math as an underground and i've always appreciated geometry a and just the shapes alone, ar just look like brilliant works of modernist art. And just obviously, no two are ever the same. Not to mention a lot of them are this unearthly blue color that is just a really startling and fastening, the same color of glaciersa, you know, in various parts of the world, that blue color is just really amazing. And i also just love how it's sort of constant shedding from our antarctic continent, from greenland. You knotice this constant process of snow falling inland and pushing the glaciers further out to sea and them breaking loose. I mean, obviously it seems to be happening faster these days, but it' sort of this constant shedding and sort of, i always like thinking bout how the body has something similar, you know, constantly shedding and renewing and rebuilding everything. And so ice is sort of this constant, similar process.
  Speaker 2
  Yes, i did not know you were a math underground so that, i mean, you just keep getting more fascinating. You maybe take a small step in that direction. What do you find beautiful about mathematics? Why did you journey into that part of the world for a time? So,
  Speaker 1
  i liked math. I especially liked so college math. I did some calculus in high school. When i got to college math, i was amazed that there were no numbers, you know, the digits disappeared. It was just variable concepts, you know, there was almost no more numbers at all. It was like this totally abstract a, you know, kind of way of ([Time 2:03:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1386cf23-989e-4b2b-a405-826baa75c302))

- Is Medication Really Good For You?
  Summary:
  We convince ourselves, s human civilization, that something is true. Thereis just self delusion. There's a scientific community that believes a certain thing. Ah, sometimes the scientific communi rites. Sometimes the conspiracy theories, theorists a right through all human history. I mean, and we now think the scientific community will now the science is really figured out. Were in way smarter than we were in the past.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  All kinds of narratives swimming around. We convince ourselves, s human civilization, that something is true. There's a propaganda machines. Thereis just self delusion. There's a centralized communities like this. There's a scientific community that believes a certain thing. There's e conspiracy theories that believes a certain thing. Ah, sometimes the scientific communi rites. Sometimes the conspiracy theories, theorists a right through all human history. I mean, and we now think the scientific community will now the science is really figured out. Were in way smarter than we were in the past. And then thereis these, like, interesting studies that think, robin hanson mentioned it to me that if you look at the entirety of medication, like the effect of medication on human health, if you do those kinds of broad studies, does it actually help, like toes quality of life, live a certain measures of well being, does iin look at human society as a whole, does taking medication or not actually help? And those studies find thereis no positive or negative effect if medication. And that's a very, kind of o interesting perspective. You could probably argue in a lot of ways. But the point is a cause. Cause you can bring up literally a billion cases where medication has significant positive impact on a particular patient. But you have to kind of zoom out and honestly look at possitive effects of medicine of life styled choices die, choicesof exercise or not.
