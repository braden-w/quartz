## Highlights
- Why Do You Go to War?
  Summary:
  There's a ton of evidence that humans evolved in the context of small groups and with a fair amount of small group warfare. Napoleon chagnon, who studied the anamamo for many, many years, asked them why do you go to war? A. It has been advantageous from a purely reproductive standpoint, to conquer a neighboring group, kill the males and get whatever resources they have,. And so i think that we have of courset, it's typically males, ah, who do that.

  There's a ton of evidence that humans evolved in the context of small groups and with a fair amount of small group warfare. So intertribal warfare a werea. And this is a harsh realization, but there historically, this is part of our bad evolutionary history. It has been advantageous from a purely reproductive standpoint, to conquer a neighboring group, kill the males and get whatever resources they have, including females and an sexual resources, tools as well as tools, weapons, territory and so forth and so ah. And so i think that we have of courset, it's typically males, ah, who do that. I mean, yes, some females have participated in warfare, but as far as i know, there's never been a single case in all o human recorded history of women forming a war tribe with other women to attack another group of women and kill them and capture the men as husbands. But these, this phenomenon is common in the ethnographic record and small group of studies. A. It's part of our common thing. So just one concrete example, nfortunately he's dead now. We passed away. Napoleon chagnon, who studied the anamamo for many, many years. When he first started viewing them, he asked them, why do you go to war?

We passed away. Napoleon chagnon, who studied the anamamo for many, many years. When he first started viewing them, he asked them, why do you go to war? A. And they said, well, to o capture women, of course, but it's the only sensible reason. They said, why? Why does your culture go to war? However they phrased it. And he said, well, you mould go to war for to spread democracy and ideas and everything. They pysically fell off their logs, laughing at such a stupid reason. Because why risk your life for anything other than women? Of course, it's more complex than that, because some go to war for a reputational reasons. They sayif if we don't retaliate, cause we've been attacked and they've stolen three of our women, if we don't retaliate, then we will get a reputation as exploitable, and then other groups will start to attack us as well. And so they get into these cycles of a, you know, like the hatfields of moys, of attack, counter attax, retribution. And part of it is is a reputation management a.

- Desirable Mates are Rare
  Summary:
  Mating is inherently a competitive process. desirable mates are in scarce supply relative to the numbers of who want them. That's why there's mate poaching. Mate poaching is one of the strategies that we, and my lad with david schmidt, have studied.

  Speaker 1
  Yes. And i mean, if you go to even things like a how we compete for mates, and this is another kind of strange for some people angle on it, but mating is inherently a competitive process in that desirable mates are in scarce supply relative to the numbers of who want them. And so even even post mating, after that, is after mate selection, mate attraction and mutual mate choice a desirable mate. That's why there's mate poaching. Mate poaching is one of the strategies that we, and my lad with david schmidt, have studied. A and so a. But one of the unique aspects of humans is that we compete using language. And that is, we have reputations. And humans devote a lot of effort to maintaining their reputations, to building their reputations, toa trying to recover our reputations after a loss of reputation for various reasons. But we compete for mates using language. And that includes sending signals to the persons that we're trying to attract using language, a a verbal fluency, and obviously some more recent things like poetry. But also, we use language to derogate our competitors. So one of the papers i published early on i was a research project on derogation competitors, the ways in which people impune the status, ([Time 0:21:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e6d0dab7-7a88-4cc5-9aca-f4a1cd7195e5))
- Mate Poaching
  Summary:
  We compete for mates using language. And that includes sending signals to the persons that we're trying to attract, and obviously some more recent things like poetry. But also, we use language to derogate our competitors. So it's an interesting thing, theere male competitions. We are talking about the yana mamo earlyer. Some of these some overt physical,. what what animal biolarts call contest competition, where there's a physical battle. Males do that. males do that. females do that. Females don't have as much ostentatious over battles in contest competition but we compete through language.

  But we compete for mates using language. And that includes sending signals to the persons that we're trying to attract using language, a a verbal fluency, and obviously some more recent things like poetry. But also, we use language to derogate our competitors. So one of the papers i published early on i was a research project on derogation competitors, the ways in which people impune the status, character and reputations of their rivals with the goal of making them less desirable to other people. And humans do that, and women and men both do that. So it's an interesting thing, theere male competitions. We are talking about the yana mamo earlyer. And some of these some overt physical, what what animal biolarts call contest competition, where there's a physical battle. Males do that. And so a lot of the early attention on mate competition was focused on the sort of ostentatious over battles in contest competition. But we compete through language and and so there is this big overlooked domain of women, the ways in which women compete with each other using language. And one of the things that astonish me is how a observant women are about the subtle imperfections in their rivals, and take pains to point them out.

- Why Women Derogate Other Women On Appearance
  Summary:
  Women are observant about the subtle imperfections in their rivals, and take pains to point them out. Who we have as mate is also a reflection of our own status. The attentional field magnifies what could be very small deviations from perfect symmetry or whatever they are.

So, just as as a random examples, wewent to a party thi, back in n my youth. But went to a party with a my girl friend at the time. And and i got into thi conversation with another woman who happened to be very attractive, but wethen we leave the party, and she said something just casually, off handed, like, aid, did you notice that her thighs were heavy? And i hadn't. But next time i saw her, this other woman, hat found my atten nbeing drawn to check out her, thought well. And originally it puzzled me why women would derogate other women on appearance. Well, they do it, of course, because men prioritizea appearance. But i thought, well, the man can see the woman directly with his own eyes. Why would verbal input alter his perceptions of how attractive he was? And i think that part of it is, i think there are ex cup two quick answers to that. One is the attentional one. So our attentional field, when they draw attention to it, the those, what could be very small deviations from perfect symmetry, or whatever they are, become magnified in our attentional field. But the other is that, um, who we have as mate is also a reflection of our own status. ([Time 0:24:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ad9f3e6c-e555-4ed7-ba25-fefa8f8cfa74))
- Long Term Pair Bonding
  Summary:
  i think it's an adaptation in women, that women have evolved concealed obulation. If you can't know when when a woman is fertile, then you have to stick around a lot longer. And so i think long term par bonding co evolved with concealed ovulation,. and with that also  concealed Ovulation. It gives more, would it give more power for women to select, ah, a mate? There are a couple different hypotheses about it, but the one that i think is most plausible is that of chimps.

  ah, a mate? There are a couple different hypotheses about it, but the one that i think is most plausible is that, you know, i again, comparing it to chimps. Tema goes into estrus, the male just has try to monopolize her while she's in that estros phase, and then they basically ignore the females after that. If you can't know when when a woman is fertile, then you have to stick around a lot longer.

- Concealed Ovulation
  Summary:
  Long term par bonding evolved with concealed ovulation, and with that a very different form of sexualy. We have sexed throughout the the obvos wora cycle, and chimps don't. There's little bit of making, little bit of sex toward the edges of the extra cycle, but but very little. That actually makes meeting a more fundamental part of an interaction between humans than it does for chimps. O meaning, like year round, every day, consaly selecting mas in terms biologically speaking.

- Why Men Prefer Physical Attraction More Than Women
  Summary:
  Physical appearance and youth are the two real big ones. Men prioritize those more than women do. And so that's why you have phenomena such as a th love at first sight, where sometimes men canan walk into a party and they see a woman across the room and that i'm going to marry that woman. That's the woman for me. They're in long term flection there.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  variable? Well,
  Speaker 1
  they're in long termates flection there. There's a lot of overlap. Sure. Ok um. So things like intelligence, um, good health, sense of humor, um, agreeable personality, someone who's not too neurotic or moody or or emotionally volatile. But there are key differences as well. And the differences stem frombasically fallen the limited number of domain so for men, its physical attractiveness. Physical appearance and youth are the two real big ones. Men prioritize those more than women do. And so that's why you have phenomena such as a th love at first sight, where sometimes men canan walk into a party and they see a woman across the room and that i'm going to marry that woman. That's the woman for me. Women very rarely do that. Most men don't do that either. But men are much more inclined to fall in love at first sight. That's because they prioritize physical appearance. Why? Because physical appearance provides that this wealth of information about a woman's fertility status. And this is from an evolutionary perspective, from a purely reproductive perspective. In an business school, they would call it job one. Job one is you have to select a fertile mate. So those who in our evolutionary past who selected infertile mates, so postmen pas women, for example, did not become our ancestors. So we are all the descendants of this long and unbroken chain of ancestors who, all of whom succeeded in selecting a fertile mate. But fertility cannot be observed directlycuse exactly? And and ther are cus that are probablistically related to this underlying quality of fertility that we can't observe directly.

- Why Women Have Affairs?
  Summary:
  Women have affairs because they're trying to get good jens from one guy. But when women have affairs, a 70 plus % tend to fall in love with or become attached to their affair partner. For for women, short termating is not one night's stand mading so, but rather it's a fair mading.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And what they used as markers of good genes are things like symmetrical features and masculine features. So, strong jawline, high shoulder to hip ratio, a on other other sorts of masculine features. But i started to doubt this explanation for what women want in the short term, ah, because of some other finding. So for for women, a lot of short termating is not one night's stand mading so, but rather it's a fair mading. So so if you ask the question, why do women have affairs? So let's restrict the question for the moment, my colleagues would argue, well, have affairs because they're trying to get good jens from one guy while they're getting investment from the regular partner, the husband. But the problem is that when women have affairs, a 70 plus % tend to fall in love with or become attached to their affair partner. Now, asi t 70, yes, 70, not a large majority, 70 or more. In contrast to men, where it's more like 30 % of men who have affairs fall in love with or become attached to their affair partner. So, but from a design perspective, a an engineering perspective, if you will, that's a disastrous thing if you're just trying to get good ([Time 0:41:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1e0c25b6-482a-4040-a767-ac23ea13eb33))

- Mate Switching Hypothesis
  Summary:
  These are probably the two leading hypotheses about why, why women have affairs. divest themselves of a cost inflicting partner, or partner who things aren't working out well with. And it's a way to either transition back into the mading market, or to or to trade up in the mating market. But i think the evidence for the good genus hypothesis is starting to look shakier than initially. I mean, made swishing sounds like a so from a game theory perspective, from an engineer in porspectis, seems to make a lot more sense.

And so anyway, so these are, these are probably the two leading hypotheses about why, why women have affairs, and i'm putting my money on the mate switching hypothesis, on my esteem. Colleagues are putting their money on the good genus hypothesis. But i think the evidence for the good genus hypothesis is starting to, am look shakier than initially.

- We Might Not Be Evolved for Lifelong Relationship
  Summary:
  We put a lot of value in life long, sort of in the long termiating some kind of value in the a lifelong, singular relationship like monogamy. Ye, it maybe we do psychologically. Maybe theres a big evolutionary advantage to that, and we do. But we also know that divorce is, you know, m and break ups also common and occur in all cultures. So we're just not very good at this thing. This is a heat of debate. I mean, made swishing sounds like a so, so from a game theory perspective, from an engineer in porspectis, seems to make a lot more sense.

  advantage to that, and we do. But we also know that divorce is, you know, m and break ups also common and occur in all cultures. So
  Speaker 2
  we're just not very good at this thing. Well, either we're not good at the mate selection such that a maybe were, we're not incorporating all the variables well, or we're just not good at monogamy, period
  Speaker 1
  fom an evolutionary bres well, i think there that resiate. No. That raises an interesting set of questions so i think that, i mean, one issue is is longevity. So, i mean, we didn't live to be 70, 80 years old in over 99 % of human evolutionary history. And so we didn't necessarily evolve to be mated monotomously with one for decades and decades and decades. But i also think that a long tempear bonding is a critical strategy, but mate switching is also a critical strategy.

- How to Stockpile Resources in the Body of Others
  Summary:
  In traditional cultures, that boils down to hunting skulls. Wellwoll: " wealth is, resources have always been important, especially to women" And when you have cash economies, you have both the ability to stock pile resources, but also this kind of explosion and a inequality of resources. That's evolutionarily recent.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Well, wealth is,
  Speaker 1
  resources have always been important, especially to women. So is a man able to acquire resources, and is he willing to dispense them to her and her kids? So that's always important. In traditional cultures, that boils down to hunting skulls. So if a tiostope colleage friend, kim hill, who's probably the world's leading expert on the ache of paraguay. And and you ask him, like, what what leads to high status in the ache, in mals? Hunting skills. That's that one, the one thing, the big variable, and that's resources. That's resources. Now, what's, what's interesting about modern culture s, we have cash s, but cash economies are relatively recent. And, you know, historically, that's over the vast 99 % of human evolutionary history, you weren't able to stock pile resources in the way that you are to day. Although there are, interestingly certain ways you can do it. So ou you kill a large game animal, o, you bring it back, you get some status points because you give some to your family. You can sharei more widely with the group, et cetera. A. But a, but it's going to go bad, right? You can't just xagn to keep this carcass around for the next several months. But, andnd, i think, can't think it's o steve panker who might have used to coin this phrase, tat they store the meat in the bodies of other people. And so, for example, they store it in their friends. So you know, a hunting success is a, you know, it's, it's a hit or miss kind of thing. So you might come back empty handed four times out of five. But but when you do, you share your meat with others. And then when you know, and then they reciprocate by sharing their meat with you, and so and so you can store resource in the bodies of other people. So i think an interesting way to think about it. But that can only go so far. And when you have cash economies, you have both the ability to stock pile resources, but also this kind of explosion and a inequality of resources. And that's evolutionarily recent. ([Time 0:49:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/25b9ee0d-3816-4d81-8f26-d364ebca3339))
