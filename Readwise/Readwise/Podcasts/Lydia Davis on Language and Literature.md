## Highlights
- Can a Translation Succeed in Fragmentation?
  Summary:
  I would be very cautious about accusing another language of heaving deficiencies. But i do think english has a wonderful advantage in having the doubled vocabulary, the anglo saxon vocabulary and the latin vocabulary. And not all languages, or most, don't have that advantage so we can play with the different vocabularies. You don't speak more plainly when you're speaking English. I'm going to revisit hanke by peter Hanke also gives that pression of fragmentation. In his case, i think it may be a combination of actually trying to retrieve memories that he had trouble retrieving, and allowing the book to work that way and be that way. The end of the story

  think it can succeed. In fact, not to bring it back myself, necessarily, but obviously i'm so well acquainted with my own work, pretty well acquainted anyway. But i think of the novel i wrote, the one novel, the end of the story was meant to geve the impression of fragmentation, because the narrator is trying to remember incidents, and so the memories come back in fragments. But i was thinking, even first, of a book that influenced me a lot in my writing of that, and that was elizabeth hardwick's sleepless nights, which i haven't revisited in a while. But that too gave the impression of being fragmented. But was written that way deliberately. And i think also a sorrow beyond dreams by hanke, which i'm about to revisit, by peter. Hanke also gives that pression of fragmentation. In his case, i think it may be a combination of actually trying to retrieve memories that he had trouble retrieving, and allowing the book to work that way and be that way.

  Do you worry, as a translator that some languages are a word poor thi charge is sometimes levelled against french and spanish, relative to english and german? Or do you think that not correct?

  I would be very cautious about accusing another language of heaving deficiencies. But i do think english has a wonderful advantage in having the doubled vocabulary, the anglo saxon vocabulary and the latin vocabulary. Examples being, you know, underground would be the anglo saxon version, and subterranean would be the latin of the same idea. And not all languages, or most, don't have that advantage, so we can play with the different vocabularies, and you don't speak more ([Time 0:12:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8ca09ddf-2a8e-4067-a7e8-b9f8c72b5e04))

And not all languages, or most, don't have that advantage, so we can play with the different vocabularies, and you don't speak more plainly or speak more abstractly and intellectually, we have that great facility because of our vocabulary. As
  Speaker 2
  a translator, why do you think that film sub titles are so often so bad? Certainly enough money and cinema, compared to literary translation,
  Speaker 1
  that's kind of fun. I mean, are they pressed for time? I'd have to guess, because often people press translators to get things done overnight and more and more. ([Time 0:14:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4bbc1a48-d0b9-4b45-8bc9-37f590d79956))
