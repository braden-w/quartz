## Highlights
- Speaker 1: to conquer a neighboring group, kill the males. Uh and uh get whatever resources they have, including females and and sexual resources tools as well as tools, weapons territory and so forth. And so um and so I think that we have and of course it's it's typically males um who do that. I mean, yes, some females have participated in warfare. But uh, as far as I know, there's never been a single case in all of human recorded history of women forming a war tribe with other women to attack another group of women and kill them and capture the men as husbands. But these uh this ([Time 0:09:44](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a4e8683f707348d6986497))
- Speaker 0: that that that resolves some kind of issue. 
  Speaker 1: Well yeah, it's important to establish status hierarchies, you know. Um, but um, but also, and here's, here's just another one more concrete point on on that. The Yanomami, we don't have this in our language. We just have one word for kill or murder. But your mama have um, you're either and you know, if you're a male, you're an, you know chi or a non, you know chi the non in okay are men who have not killed. If you're an, you know chi that means you have killed someone. And the, you know chi among the Yanomamo historically had higher status and more wives. So they're a religionists uh ([Time 0:13:27](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a4e8bd3f707348d69879bb))
- Speaker 1: know chi or a non, you know chi the non in okay are men who have not killed. If you're an, you know chi that means you have killed someone. And the, you know chi among the Yanomamo historically had higher status and more wives. So they're a religionists uh society, which is, which has been 
  Speaker 0: true of 
  Speaker 1: Um something like 83-85% of traditional societies or actually I was just corrected by an anthropologist. He said we no longer call them traditional societies. We call them small scale societies. 
  Speaker 0: So nothing can be called traditional, 
  Speaker 1: I don't know, 
  Speaker 0: traditional society. 
  Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. I think it's just one of these things, the ([Time 0:13:52](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a4e8c63f707348d6987b83))
- Speaker 0: that kind of 
  Speaker 1: thing. Yeah. Well I think it's hard to isolate one factor. I know I know you've had Richard Wrangham on this podcast. It was a wonderful, wonderful interview and uh he used to be a colleague of mine when I was a professor at michigan and um I've stayed in touch with him. Uh I don't know if he's a brilliant, brilliant guy and he thinks fire and cooking has been one of the key things. But I think it's hard to isolate. I would trace at least part of our uniqueness to uh the uniqueness of our mating system. So we have in in mating unlike chimpanzees who are our closest primate relatives of which Richard Wrangham is is a world's expert. But ([Time 0:15:11](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a4e8e43f707348d698805b))
- Speaker 1: through language. Um, and uh, and so there's this big overlooked domain of women. The ways in which women compete with each other using language. And one of the things that astonished me is how um, observant women are about the subtle imperfections in their rivals and take pains to point them out. So just, this is um, random examples went went to a party, 
  Speaker 0: this 
  Speaker 1: is back in my youth, but I went to a party with my girlfriend at the time and uh and I got into this conversation with another woman who happened to be very attractive. But um and then we leave the ([Time 0:24:02](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a4e9b13f707348d6989e9b))
- Speaker 1: those what could be very small deviations from perfect symmetry or whatever, they are become magnified in our attentional field. But the other is that who we have as a mate is also a reflection of our own status. Um and and and when you saw this in a kind of overt and uh way in the earlier, the last presidential, not the last part of the uh 2016 presidential election where uh donald trump was saying this was when he was in competition with Ted Cruz, I think in the primary said, look, look at my wife, look at Ted Cruz, his life and his wife and he really importuned the ([Time 0:25:35](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a4e9d53f707348d698a325))
- Speaker 1: skin deep. Uh, you know, don't judge people on the superficial characteristics, but in fact physical appearance provides a wealth of information about the health status of someone there. Uh in the case of males, their physical formidability and we have formidability assessment adaptations. And then fertility as well. So there are a very predictable set of accused of fertility that have evolved to be part of our standards of attractiveness. And and they're not arbitrary. There are some culturally arbitrary ones. So like you go to the Maori in New Zealand for example, and they find tattoos on their lips to be very ([Time 0:28:57](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a63dc43f707348d6c89000))
    - Note: Predictors of fertility (symmetrical features, waist to hip ratio)
- Speaker 0: is that is that a cool in a powerful invention for the human species? 
  Speaker 1: I think it's it's an adaptation in women that women have evolved, concealed ovulation. Uh And I think it's a feature, not a bug that 
  Speaker 0: gives more. Would it give more power for women to select a mate? 
  Speaker 1: There are a couple of different hypotheses about it, but the one that I think is most plausible is that, you know, again, comparing its chimps, the female goes into estrus. The mail just has to try to monopolize her while she's in that estrous phase. And then they basically ignore the females after that ([Time 0:33:07](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a4ea823f707348d698b7c0))
    - Note: Concealed Ovulation
- Speaker 1: ovulation. Uh And I think it's a feature, not a bug that 
  Speaker 0: gives more. Would it give more power for women to select a mate? 
  Speaker 1: There are a couple of different hypotheses about it, but the one that I think is most plausible is that, you know, again, comparing its chimps, the female goes into estrus. The mail just has to try to monopolize her while she's in that estrous phase. And then they basically ignore the females after that if you can't know when, when a woman is fertile, then you have to stick around a lot longer. And so I think long term pair ([Time 0:33:16](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a4ea863f707348d698b879))
- Speaker 1: again, comparing its chimps, the female goes into estrus. The mail just has to try to monopolize her while she's in that estrous phase. And then they basically ignore the females after that if you can't know when, when a woman is fertile, then you have to stick around a lot longer. And so I think long term pair bonding co evolved with concealed ovulation. Uh and with that also very different form of sexuality, which is that we have sex throughout the regulatory cycle. Um and chimps don't, you know, there's there's a little bit of mating, a little bit of sex toward the edges of the um estrous cycle, ([Time 0:33:39](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a4ea8f3f707348d698b981))
    - Note: Long term pair bonding co evolved with concealed ovulation.
- Speaker 1: reproductive perspective in in business school they would call it job one Job one is you have to select a fertile mate. So those who in our evolutionary past who selected infertile mates. So postmenopausal women for example, um did not become our ancestors. So we are all the descendants of this long and unbroken chain of ancestors who all of whom success succeeded selecting infertile mate. But fertility cannot be observed directly. It can 
  Speaker 0: use some cues 
  Speaker 1: exactly. And and there are cues that are probabilistic lee related to this underlying quality of fertility that we can't observe ([Time 0:38:29](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a4eafe3f707348d698c95b))
- Speaker 1: uh and masculine features, so strong jawline, high shoulder to hip ratio. Um You know, other other sorts of masculine features. But I started to doubt this explanation for what women want in the short term. Um because of some other findings. So for for women, a lot of short term mating is not one Night stand mating. So, but rather it's a fair mating. So, uh so if you ask the question, why do women have affairs? So let's restrict the question. For the moment, my colleagues would ([Time 0:41:19](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a4eb3f3f707348d698d215))
- Speaker 1: term mating is not one Night stand mating. So, but rather it's a fair mating. So, uh so if you ask the question, why do women have affairs? So let's restrict the question. For the moment, my colleagues would argue, well, women have affairs because they're trying to get good genes from one guy, while they're getting investment from the regular partner, the husband. Okay. But the problem is that when women have affairs 70-plus% tend to fall in love with or become attached to their affair partner. Now, 
  Speaker 0: what percentage, 70? 
  Speaker 1: Yeah, 77 
  Speaker 0: majority, 
  Speaker 1: 70 or ([Time 0:41:46](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a4eb4a3f707348d698d316))
    - Note: 70%+ of women fall in love with their affair partner.
- Speaker 1: good genes. Surreptitiously from this, you know, a guy who presumably has more falling in love with him becoming a catch. That's that's not a feature. You want 
  Speaker 0: bad engineering. 
  Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly. It's bad engineering. And so and so I developed an alternative hypothesis that I call the mate switching hypothesis, which is that um Affairs are one way in which women um divest themselves of a cost inflicting partner or a partner who things aren't working out well with. And it's a way to either transition back into the mating market or to or to trade up in in the mating market. Uh And and so ([Time 0:42:54](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a4eb643f707348d698d7f7))
    - Note: Mate Switching Hypothesis as a Means to Trade Up the Market
- Speaker 1: Affairs are one way in which women um divest themselves of a cost inflicting partner or a partner who things aren't working out well with. And it's a way to either transition back into the mating market or to or to trade up in in the mating market. Uh And and so and anyway, so these are these are probably the two leading hypotheses about why why women have affairs. And I I'm putting my money on the mate switching hypothesis. Um my esteemed colleagues are putting their money on the good genes hypothesis, but I think the evidence for the good genes hypothesis is starting to um 
  Speaker 0: look 
  Speaker 1: shakier than initially. ([Time 0:43:16](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a4eb6c3f707348d698d8e4))
    - Note: Mate Switching Hypothesis as a Means to Trade Up the Market
- Speaker 0: maybe we're we're not incorporating all the variables well or we're just not good at monogamy period from an evolutionary perspective. 
  Speaker 1: Well I think there that's raising know that raises an interesting set of questions. So I think that I mean one issue is longevity. So I mean we didn't 
  Speaker 0: live to 
  Speaker 1: Be 70, 80 years old 
  Speaker 0: and 
  Speaker 1: Over 99% of human evolutionary history. And so we didn't necessarily evolve to be made it monogamous lee with one person for decades and decades and decades. But I also think that 
  Speaker 0: um 
  Speaker 1: long term ([Time 0:44:47](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a4eb8f3f707348d698dc51))
    - Note: Longer lifespans challenge 
      relationships. We didn’t necessarily evolve to be monogomous for 70, 80+ years.
- Speaker 0: um 
  Speaker 1: long term pair bonding is a critical strategy but mate switching is also a critical strategy. So if you have a mate for example who becomes cost inflicting or becomes sufficiently debilitated or who um suffers an injury. Such that like in hunter gatherer societies where the mate can no longer hunt can no longer provide resources for their kids. And and and the woman this becomes this becomes a problem. And so uh and so I think that we have adaptations to mate switch and to divest ourselves from some partners and trade up in the mating market under certain conditions. ([Time 0:45:30](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a4eb933f707348d698dd1f))
    - Note: Long term pair bonding and mate switching are both important strategies.
- Speaker 3: The effects of learning, um, what you made in comparison to what other people made depended on whether you are a high earner or a low earner to begin with. So people who were below average when they learned that other people were making much more than them, they felt very dissatisfied people who uh, were higher up when they found out how well they were doing compared to other people, ironically, it didn't have the same effect. They didn't feel overjoyed at the fact that they were doing so well, their reaction was just sort of neutral. So, uh, they weren't any happier, but the people at the bottom were made more unhappy. 
  Speaker 0: So when you look at the example of the sacramento bee and, and, and the publication of the ([Time 0:45:44](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a4ebce3f707348d698e2b3))
    - Note: We have evolutionary to trade up in the mating market
- Speaker 3: and pay itself is necessarily a good outcome or a bad outcome. But what I think transparency shows is, uh, the underlying assumptions that we have. So if you think that incentivizing good performance with very high pay is a good thing, then you would want your company to have full transparency. So everybody in the company could see that the superstars were getting paid a lot and that other people weren't getting paid so much and the people who are the poor performers are getting paid very poorly. If if your idea is that pay inequity increases performance, you should want total transparency and yet, what we have is a system in which most companies, most organizations want to keep their pay ([Time 0:46:50](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a4ebce3f707348d698e2a7))
    - Note: Physically fit , taller , shoulders, not muscle bound
- Speaker 0: no just a little bit, a little bit of a cushion for the pushin. I don't know what the kids call it these days but just a little bit a little bit of a fat. So what's why do do they not want you guys to be obsessed with their body? Is that or is there some evolutionary thing? 
  Speaker 1: Yeah. I think that um women might interpret a guy who is so obsessed with his body that he's uh they might view that as a sign of dark narcissism. Um And that's not a good 
  Speaker 0: trade. Huh? What about like cultures where large sort of overweight men are valued? Is that how do you explain like how much can we ([Time 0:48:16](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a54bf33f707348d6a5c8fd))
    - Note: People might view caring about your body too much as narcissism
- Speaker 1: There's evidence that um it hurts women's self esteem. So here's just another uh factoid or fact if you will that at least in Western cultures, males and females have roughly the same overall average levels of self esteem. But once puberty hits all of a sudden women's self esteem starts to drop. And I think it's because when they enter make competition, then they start um uh elevating the importance they attached to physical appearance. And then as you point out the the tremendous objectification that it saturates social media and media in general is um it's ([Time 1:02:25](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a6423a3f707348d6c939a4))
    - Note: Men and women tend to have similar levels of self esteem until puberty. Then, the objectification of women drops their self esteem.
- Speaker 1: these say nine figures that vary from very, very thin to average two to plump men give it the midpoint. They say the midpoint is in relative thinness or plumpness is what I value. And you ask women, what is your ideal body type for you? They give it, they say thinner. But then if you ask them, what do you think males ideal body type is? They put it in exactly the same spot that they put their own ideal, which is thin. And so there's actually an inaccurate perception of how thin men desire women to be. Uh and I think that's partly exacerbated by the fashion industry, where ([Time 1:05:10](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a6423c3f707348d6c93a0e))
    - Note: The innacurate perception of how thin men desire women to be.
- Speaker 1: lure is that clothes hang better on thin models and then on TV they say you gain £15 over what you really are or whatever. But for whatever reason women misperceive how thin men want them to be. And so you have, this is another huge sex difference. Is eating disorders. Um Anorexia. Uh for example, bulimia binging purging. Where these these disorders, eating disorders are 9 to 10 times more common in women than men. 
  Speaker 0: Can I just take a small tangent because it was such a beautiful the sunscreen song. Such a beautiful one. If I can read some of the words from it, I really enjoy it. 
  Speaker 1: It's ([Time 1:06:00](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a6423b3f707348d6c939f6))
    - Note: Eating disorders are much more common in women.
- Speaker 0: those words, whereas sunscreen, if I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. A long term benefits of sunscreen have been proven by scientists. Whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they've faded. But trust me in 20 years, you'll look back at the photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You're not as fat as you imagine. Don't worry about the future or worry. But know ([Time 1:07:04](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a6423b3f707348d6c939e9))
    - Note: Why you should wear sunscreen.
- Speaker 1: one of the interesting things is that uh it's called the people's thing dimension. So do you want an occupation? You want a job that involves um people social interaction or are you happy with the job that just involves things, mechanical objects or computer code or whatever? And this is one of the largest psychological sex differences that that exists. And it's true in every culture. So uh in terms of, I don't know, um magnitude of effects, it's an effect size of more than a standard deviation difference between the means um on this psychological sex difference. And so one of the ([Time 1:15:36](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a6423c3f707348d6c93a00))
    - Note: People things dimension (sexual differences), and its presence in even the most egalitarian societies.
- Speaker 1: and this is than a sound strange or and hopefully not offensive to people. But um if you ask the question, why are why is it the case that men are in positions of power so much more so than women? Well, in part it can be traced to women's mate preferences. So it's one of the sex differences that women have over evolutionary time preferred men who had power, status, resources um etcetera. And what that has done is it's created selection pressure on men to attach a high motivational priority to clawing their way up the status hierarchy. Um And and uh studies of time allocation distribution show this where men are they're more willing to sacrifice their their friends, their grandmother, their kin or whatever to claw their way up to the top of status hierarchies. Women much less women uh spend more effort maintaining relationships with their kin, their friends, their friend that works and so forth. And so um and and so in a way, uh so so you could say not only are you not only our men in positions of power more than women now you're blaming women for why they are. And it's not it's not a matter of blame, but I think that that what I just outlined is an essential part of the causal process. The co evolution of women's mate preferences with men's motivational priorities. ([Time 1:29:07](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a6423b3f707348d6c939bb))
    - Note: Why are men in positions of power more than women? A possible evolutionary answer lies in women’s mating preferences for men who have power and status from the status hierarchy, which selects for men who have high motivation to climb the ranks. In contrast, women spend more time with relationships.
- Speaker 0: to the light, 
  Speaker 1: right? Well it can be addictive but um it's not good for long term relationships. I mean that characteristic and and there there is a stable personality characteristic. It goes under different names, anxiety, neuroticism, emotional ability, etcetera. But that's the single personality characteristic that's 
  Speaker 0: that is most 
  Speaker 1: predictive of breakups and divorces. Um And and in studies that I've done 
  Speaker 0: predictive 
  Speaker 1: of conflict in couples, people who are emotionally unstable, they just get into a lot of conflict with their partner. They 
  Speaker 0: create create 
  Speaker 1: havoc. Um So um 
  Speaker 0: and they they 
  Speaker 1: can be exciting but ([Time 1:44:38](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a642fd3f707348d6c95425))
    - Note: Neuroticism is the single biggest predictor of relationship breakup.
- Speaker 1: of a bond. And so he asked the question like why do people inflict costs on their part? Like even like kissing your, you're introducing, you know, it's a disease vector, You know why do people do these weird things um inflicting costs or emotional liability is a way of inflicting costs. And what he argues is it's it's the testing of a bond if the person is willing to tolerate, you know this level of stress, this level of cost and position, then that means they must be very committed to me. And so uh and I think that's something people do in romantic 
  Speaker 0: relationships 
  Speaker 1: as they they do test the strength of the bond. They they test the the commitment of the person. And 
  Speaker 0: I think it's ([Time 1:46:00](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a642fd3f707348d6c95439))
    - Note: People inflict costs (kissing, disease transfer) as a test of commitment.
- Speaker 1: where both of you are unfamiliar 
  Speaker 0: or something like that. 
  Speaker 1: Yeah. So where where you you experience unexpected things, stresses, uh you get a flat tire or whatever you encounter and you see how the person deals with stress and you see how you deal with each other under stress. And I think that that that's um unless you have put stress tests on relationships, you really don't know where things stand. 
  Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a beautiful way to put it. I'm a huge fan of that like road trip and not just late in a relationship blake Day one road trip, not day one day negative one before it even happens to see stress test uh because it makes everybody better, it creates ([Time 1:47:20](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a642fd3f707348d6c9542f))
    - Note: Try exploring a foreign country with your partner. Seeing your partner react to stress is a good way of testing them.
- Speaker 0: role of jealousy? Something you also written about in a relationship is uh, is that a feature or a bug? You can't you started to speak about it, but it's is it good to be jealous of your partner inside of a relationship? How does it go wrong? How the pros and cons. 
  Speaker 1: So, uh I've written a whole book on this called the dangerous passion, um why jealousy is as necessary as sex and love. And I think that one cut at your question is that a moderate. So, first of all, I think it's it's a feature, not a bug in in most cases, so in the in the sense that you you have to have an adaptation that is sensitive to threats to a valued relationship. Okay, because and I think I alluded to this earlier, that just because you're in a relationship and you're in a relationship with a desirable partner doesn't mean that, you know, you've finished solving the problems of mating that you need to solve because there are threats from the outside. So mate poachers, people who try to lure your partner away for either a sexual encounter or more committed romantic relationship, and then there's also dissatisfaction within the relationship. So your partner might become tempted to be sexually unfaithful or romantically unfaithful or emotionally unfaithful. And so, and so we need humans with the evolution of long term pair bonding. We need adaptations to guard the relationship and be sensitive to threats to the ([Time 1:50:26](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a642fc3f707348d6c953ea))
    - Note: The role of jealousy in relationships.
- Speaker 1: is intersects with this topic in that um men sometimes women to a lesser degree developed homicidal ideation about people who are trying to poach their mates or who do poach their mates successfully poached their mates. So what jealousy does is it is it alerts you to a threat to the relationship and it motivates um checking out the source of the threat. How threatening is this? So people tend to increase vigilance of their partner in the modern world includes, you know, hacking into their cell phone or computer monitoring them. Um uh Sometimes stalking them. Uh But also can ([Time 1:52:58](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a647e43f707348d6c9fcb2))
    - Note: The role of jealousy in relationships continued.
- Speaker 1: errors in mate selection which they do. So sometimes you think this person is well matched on mate value but they're not. But then things change. So a let's say uh they're the same. You have two sixes and then all of a sudden the woman's career takes off all of a sudden she's, you know getting promotion. She's acquiring wealth. She's attracting men who are of a different mate value than she previously did. Well that triggers jealousy and the guy, even if she swears she's going to be totally loyal and she has no signs of leaving or no signs of infidelity, a mate value discrepancy is going to trigger jealousy. Now what can it do? Well, it can do in ([Time 1:54:33](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a647e43f707348d6c9fcc2))
    - Note: Mate value discrepancy can trigger jealousy.
- Speaker 1: I need to devote more attention to my partner, I need to up my game when it comes to resource acquisition. I need to lavish more attention and gifts on her. And so there's a whole suite of benefit provisioning things that can help to reduce that mate value discrepancy. And then there's also cost inflicting things that and and and humans unfortunately do both both sets of things. 
  Speaker 0: Yeah. There's also this uh maybe that's love. I notice um the people I especially love or have a connection to romantically or otherwise there's a feeling like I don't deserve you so ([Time 1:55:28](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a647e43f707348d6c9fcd2))
    - Note: Jealousy from mate value discrepancy has pros and cons (more gifts, but also ideation).
- Speaker 1: you go to a party with your partner and then you leave the room for some reason you come back and your partner is passionately kissing someone else and it doesn't bother you at all. Um that might be a cue to the partner that maybe you're not very in love with that person or not very committed to them. And so 
  Speaker 0: it's a good way to, it's a good way to test that said. I mean, I love the term mate poaching by the way, I believe here in texas, mate, poaching is official legal. So, one of my favorite songs by Hendrix's hey joe. Um hey joe. Where you going with that gun in your hand? And yeah, I actually, I always wanted to play that song, but I get it. I start to think about guns and so on. I think it's supposed to capture a feeling. It's not actual violence. It's saying I'm going to shoot my old lady. I caught her messing around with another man. That's um, that's a blues type of feeling like of anger. Of um, I guess from mate poaching for mate switching performed by the partner and then the, the frustration and the anger that's resulting, that I always wondered why the violence is directed towards the partner versus the person who did the 
  Speaker 1: yeah, it's the 
  Speaker 0: other male tends 
  Speaker 1: to be evenly split. Um, So sometimes, and that's, I mean, men, especially when someone poaches on their made, they have homicidal fantasies 
  Speaker 0: which explored 
  Speaker 1: the mate poacher. Yeah, but, but, but equally split. So, so it's uh, um, I think ([Time 1:58:24](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a647e53f707348d6c9fcec))
    - Note: Mate poaching and homocidal ideation.
- Speaker 1: in someone else and you discover that they have had a passionate sexual intercourse with this person and they've gotten emotionally involved with them. They've fallen in love with them. Which aspect of the infidelity upsets you more and when you And that's why it's called the Sophia shorts both terrible choices? Uh but men much more likely to say the sexual infidelity is what upsets me more women. It's like why are you even asking me? It's a no brainer. 85% of the women say the emotional infidelity is what bothers me more. Former student of mine. Barry Cooley did a really interesting study of analysis of this reality show called cheaters. I've ([Time 2:06:28](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a647e53f707348d6c9fcfc))
    - Note: Men are more upset by sexual infidelity and women are more upset by emotional infidelity. (Universal Sex Difference)
- Speaker 1: scientific questions that I wouldn't have thought of necessarily. Um and so um and so anyway, so it turned out to be a good collaboration, I will I will say that we co wrote it and that I did contribute uh especially the the the evolutionary insights. 
  Speaker 0: So is there a good few words you can say uh to why women have sex? What are some primary motivations? 
  Speaker 1: Well, we we originally came up with a list of 237 reasons for why uh why humans have sex. And they range from, you know, some of the obvious ones because it feels good uh because I wanted to relieve stress uh be to relieve menstrual cramps to get rid of a headache uh to get my boyfriend off my back so I could get some work done. Um So things like that to to others like um there's another one so that he'd take out the damn garbage one, but another one that was kind of interesting that someone, one nomination was to get closer to God. So there there were some that were kind of spiritual spiritual motivations for having sex. And then some of the nastier ones like to get revenge my my, you know my partner or to get revenge on arrival. So that's sleeping with my, you know rivals boyfriend. You know, so there's some nasty stuff and some good stuff in there. 
  Speaker 0: It's so fascinating because yes, sex has such a powerful role in our psychology but also in our culture. ([Time 2:16:15](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a647e53f707348d6c9fd1a))
    - Note: Why women have sex
- Speaker 1: more prone to those than females, 
  Speaker 0: she said. Almost 
  Speaker 1: all fetishes and males are overrepresented and I think it's partly because there's some evidence that they're classically conditioned. So I think that first or early sexual experiences that people have kind of conditioned them to the cues that are present during those early ones. And so if your first sexual experience happened to be, you know, um 
  Speaker 0: involved visual 
  Speaker 1: images of shoes, or you haven't been looking at shoes when you first had sex, That's just an example. We're leather or zippers or whatever the case is um that people develop these very ([Time 2:19:46](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a647e53f707348d6c9fd0f))
    - Note: Men are overrepresented in fetishes.
- Speaker 1: that's going to lead to 
  Speaker 0: sex 
  Speaker 1: because whereas women don't 
  Speaker 0: have to be 
  Speaker 1: from male perspective because of women's greater investment because the nine month pregnancy, etcetera 
  Speaker 0: in 
  Speaker 1: order to reproduce, women have to invest this tremendous amount. Men Don't, one Act of sex can produce an offspring. And so uh for men, but not for women. And so this huge asymmetry and investment means that the payoff matrix of different sexual strategies differs for the sexes. In that context, women become the valuable and scarce resource over which men compete. So anything that at least a successful 
  Speaker 0: sex is 
  Speaker 1: going to be selected for it. And so men are very sensitive to being sexually conditioned. That's what's called sexual conditioning to whatever accuse are associated with sex happening. Um from a woman's perspective, sex is not a um a scarce resource. So a woman could go out here in in Austin Um any night or probably any day on 6th street and have no problem having sex 
  Speaker 0: uh 
  Speaker 1: With a guy within 10 minutes. Okay, the guy would have more difficulty, uh he's not going to go out, you know, unless he's unless he's johnny Depp er really, really charming. 
  Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a fascinating dime, or fascism, or asymmetry ([Time 2:21:31](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a647e53f707348d6c9fd25))
    - Note: Men are selected for “Sexual Conditioning” because sex is a scarer resource for them (a possible explanation for fetish overrepresentation).
- Speaker 0: either self identified as in cells or who had mentioned in self-related names and writings in their private writings or internet postings insult communities have been criticized by researchers and the media for being misogynistic, encouraging violence, spreading extremist views and radicalizing their members. Is there some insight that you draw from this connection of sex and lack of sex to violence? 
  Speaker 1: Well, I think sex and violence are linked and in various ways. Uh, and uh, it's, it's, it's not just, it's not just in cell. So, uh, uh, if you look at, ([Time 2:30:23](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a647e53f707348d6c9fd3b))
    - Note: Relationship of lack of sex (incels) and violence.
- Speaker 1: interest, 
  Speaker 0: super fancy word for hobby. I got it. Uh, 
  Speaker 1: that's like, like Ted Bundy. Um, he was actually very charming and, and didn't have any trouble attracting women, but his killing spree started shortly after he was rejected by a very high status, attractive woman. Uh, and he felt a rage about being rejected by her. Now who knows? That's an end of one. And we don't know if, you know, you know, being rejected, um, causes serial killing per se, but sex and violence are related in different ways. Um, I, uh, ([Time 2:31:26](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a64aa03f707348d6ca7222))
    - Note: Ted Bundy’s killing spree allegedly started becaues he was rejected by a high status woman.
- Speaker 0: know the story throughout all that she stood by his side because she refused to believe everything that was happening until until um you know the very end. Of course it shifts in the very end and that's a fascinating shift of the the breaking of the illusion. But it's really fascinating that you can have those two things that. Yeah. 
  Speaker 1: Yeah. Well I think that 
  Speaker 0: part of 
  Speaker 1: it is we 
  Speaker 0: have these 
  Speaker 1: stereotypes that we expect people like serial killers to be these um ugly um drooling creatures that are sort of evil all the time. Uh And so um that's why even like you had um I don't know if this is ([Time 3:00:34](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a64bc83f707348d6caa487))
    - Note: Ted Bundy’s Relationship while committing his crimes.
- Speaker 1: creatures that are sort of evil all the time. Uh And so um that's why even like you had um I don't know if this is if I'm remembering this correctly, but like Stalin who 
  Speaker 0: killed 
  Speaker 1: you know millions, millions of people apparently like loved his kids and loved his family and people. So so we have that's part of the complication, the complexity of human nature and human psychology is we we don't have just this one, 
  Speaker 0: you know, 
  Speaker 1: this one property that dictates how we behave in all circumstances. 
  Speaker 0: Yeah, the devil is going to be charismatic, that's why ([Time 3:01:08](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a64bc83f707348d6caa48a))
    - Note: The devil will be charismatic.
- Speaker 1: there's a lot that we don't know, we know enough to at least provide some heuristics or general guidelines to things to watch out for. So just as a concrete example uh with intimate partner violence? Uh And this is male to female. There are statistical predictors of is the sky, does he have an increased probability of beating you up? Uh And there are things like if he starts to insist on knowing where you are at all times, if he starts cutting off your relationships with your friends and your family. Um so there are these kind of early warning signs. And I think women should know about those or even things like That. ([Time 3:06:14](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a64bc83f707348d6caa494))
    - Note: Statistical predictors of inter partner violence.
- Speaker 1: kind of early warning signs. And I think women should know about those or even things like That. Women are most in danger of being killed by an ex during the 1st 3-6 months after they've broken up with him. You know, that that sometimes they think it's, you know, the guy will say meet with me 11 last time and then I won't bother you again. Um No, this is a dangerous time. So I think there's some knowledge that we do know that can be used to make informed decisions about our mating lives and I think that should be taught. 
  Speaker 0: So consider that like take that the the the the mating strategy is the main remaining life seriously. 
  Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. ([Time 3:06:50](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a64bc83f707348d6caa49e))
    - Note: Women are most likely to be killed by an ex 3-6 months after a relationship.
- Speaker 1: if we're talking about romance, romantic love, I think it's an evolved emotion. Um Leading hypothesis is that it's a it's a commitment device. So if I say to a potential mate, oh you exceed my minimum thresholds on intelligence and and looks, I think we make a good couple. Yeah. It wouldn't it wouldn't do much um emotionally, but if but if you see, say, you know, I love you, it's I I can't I can't stop thinking about you. It's just uncontrollable emotion that I feel towards you. It's it's a sign that you know that I'm committed to you uh at least for a while. Uh and I'm not going to abandon you when when, you know, if you're an eight and when an 8.5 comes along, I'm not going to drop you and go with the 8.5. Uh 
  Speaker 0: That's that's so interesting. But that's you know, it's still still the reality of the emotion is there, however it involved is still there. And it's interesting, it's one of the ([Time 3:17:54](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a64df93f707348d6caed87))
