## Highlights
- Justice Kennedy Decides Political Corruption Doesn't Exist
  Summary:
  The Supreme Court ruled that unlimited independent campaign contributions do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of it. The decision was made by Justice Kennedy, who says he knows better than te no elof sight. This is bad punditry and i would be embarrassed to make that argument. But nevertheless, it is a crucial decision that is not, in any way that i can tell, truly illegal.

  Speaker 1
  I
  Speaker 2
  want to say it's worse than your saying here. This patirla opinion. And if you listen to thi show, i think you'lve see in overtime that i don't have very much respect for the supreme court. And it's because of opinions like citizens united were i read them an realize they're doing what i do, just worse. They're just running crappy punditry. So you ere talking about kennedy's views there of whether corruption can be addressed. But kennedy goes further. He talks about whether or not corruption is present. He he makes as cor his inion, like an actual view, about whether or not political contributions of this kind will either create real corruption or the appearance of it. Because he agrees on some level that there is an interest in reducing corruption and the appearance of it. So he he writes, we now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. He goes on to say, the fact that speakers, by which he means here donors, may have influence over or access to elected officials, does not mean that these officials are corrupt. Then he goes on to say, the appear rence of influence or access furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy. And i don't understand how you can see that is anything but punditry. I mean, bad punditry. I would be embarrassed to make that argument. But nevertheless, it is a crucial decision that is not, in any way that i can tell, truly illegal decision. Much like john roberts decides racism isn't that bad any more, justice kennedy decides political corruption isn't that bad any more. And what is so weird about it to me is, if you would imagine that there would be anywhere in the world, in the law that you would obviously defer to elected politicians on what is going on here, it would be on the question of whether or not unlimited independent campaign contributions lead to corruption, or the appearance of corruption in political practice. And kennidy decides he knows better than te no elof sight. ([TimeÂ 0:38:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9a6bb73b-7879-4751-b487-e4b067e45efc))
