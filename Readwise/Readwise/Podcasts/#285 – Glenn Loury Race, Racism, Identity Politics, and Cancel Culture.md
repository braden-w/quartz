## Highlights
- Speaker 1: them into your property was very, very widespread in human culture. Uh, So I mean, I I'd like to make this point sometimes when we people are talking about how wrong slavery was and I agree without any question that the practice was profoundly morally problematic. But I like to make the point that given how wrong it was, think about how impressive was the accomplishment of the eradication of slavery. That was something, I mean, there were 600,000 dead In the war between the states, 1861-1865 in a country of 30 million ([Time 0:25:25](https://www.airr.io/quote/629a1efce6f4a6f5a9578b38))
    - Note: The case against calling African Americans, but just Black Americans or American.
- Speaker 1: dead In the war between the states, 1861-1865 in a country of 30 million people. That's a, that's a lot of dead people uh who gave their lives not to eradicate slavery. And in every instance, probably most of them were just fighting for uh you know, they, they enlisted or were conscripted into the forces and they fought and they died. But the net effect of there having fun and died was to push along a process that led to the eradication of slavery. That's an amazing achievement. The slaves themselves were largely uneducated and uh, you know, ([Time 0:26:03](https://www.airr.io/quote/629a1f0ae6f4a6f5a9578daf))
- Speaker 1: Obama is president of the United States. Now he did not descend from slaves. I think we must not lose track of that, but he identified as an african american and was a part of the population that consisted largely of people who descended from slaves. And we are, we african americans are for all practical purposes, fully equal citizens of this great republic. That has happened within a century and a half. And I don't know that you can find any parallel to that kind of transformation and the status of people from human chattel, two full citizens of the republic anywhere in human history. It's certainly ([Time 0:27:21](https://www.airr.io/quote/629a1f28e6f4a6f5a95792f5))
- Speaker 0: ended up going into economics at one of the great economics programs in the world at M. I. T. And getting your PG there. So one of the many hats you wear is that of an economist which allows you to think systematically and rigorously about the way the world and the way humans work at scale. Um Trying to remove the full mushy mess of humans. Like a psychology perspective, economics allows you to do 
  Speaker 1: well, economics is one of the social sciences. I think there's value in psychology and in sociology there's a lot to know that doesn't come up with in the study of economics, we study markets and you know the dynamics of economic development and ([Time 0:47:07](https://www.airr.io/quote/629a20f1e6f4a6f5a957ef46))
- Speaker 1: no largest prime number. Okay. So how do I how would how would somebody know that? Okay. What's the prime number? So a prime number is a number that has a whole number that has no divisor Other than one. There are no devises of the number that makes it a prime number like 13 or 19 or 37 whenever. Okay, so they're prime 
  Speaker 0: numbers. 
  Speaker 1: There's no largest prime number. There are an infinite number of prime numbers. There's no largest prime number. Okay. That's an idea. You can get your mind around it in an instant. It doesn't take a whole lot of depth to see the question. There's no largest prime number. 
  Speaker 0: I wonder if prime numbers show up in economics. I mean that 
  Speaker 1: they don't show up in economics but except cryptography, I understand 
  Speaker 0: important. Yes. Yes. 
  Speaker 1: For code. ([Time 0:49:59](https://www.airr.io/quote/629a21a3e6f4a6f5a95803a5))
- Speaker 1: that kind of stuff. Or girdles of theorem. I I studied this as an undergraduate, you know, the incompleteness theorem that there are propositions within any logical system that's rich enough to accommodate uh accommodate arithmetic, they're going to be propositions that you can formulate that are true, but that you cannot prove to be true. Uh so the idea that you could systematically develop a logical framework for mathematical inquiry, uh that could demonstrate the truth or falsity of any proposition uh is uh not a feasible goal. This was Hilbert's project as I understand it. And ([Time 0:51:50](https://www.airr.io/quote/629a21a3e6f4a6f5a95803a3))
- Speaker 1: for mathematical inquiry, uh that could demonstrate the truth or falsity of any proposition uh is uh not a feasible goal. This was Hilbert's project as I understand it. And uh, girdle showed that there was no hope ever of being able 
  Speaker 0: to 
  Speaker 1: demonstrate the closure of of of logical systems that were rich enough to accommodate the real numbers. They 
  Speaker 0: gave an existential crisis to all uh mathematicians and scientists alike and humans because maybe you can't prove everything. 
  Speaker 1: I remember, you know, when I was, I was a junior college, a community college student before I transferred to Northwestern and I took a calculus ([Time 0:52:19](https://www.airr.io/quote/629a21a3e6f4a6f5a95803a7))
- Speaker 0: you know, the world is made up of individuals. So there's a connection to our discussion of, of race and discrimination and outcomes and all those kinds of things. The world is made up of individuals. But in order to say something general, we have to construct groups in order to analyze the data. We have to aggregate that data. Somehow we have to make an average over some set of people. So what are the pros and cons of looking at things like equality of opportunity and equality of outcome based on groups versus based on individuals? And what are the groups ([Time 0:56:14](https://www.airr.io/quote/629a21c3e6f4a6f5a95807af))
- Speaker 1: you know, you think supply and demand and a bunch of markets, you think prices that moved to equal a break. But you recognize that the price in one market affects people's behavior and another. The markets interacting with each other. You realize that the behavior of one individual affects the uh supplies and available resources and for other individuals. So they're knitted together in some kind of systematic way. And you you want to try to demonstrate the fact that notwithstanding all these interdependencies. There exists a solution to the system of equations that equates demand and supply across all the different markets. This is the existence of general ([Time 0:57:35](https://www.airr.io/quote/629a21e4e6f4a6f5a9580ac0))
- Speaker 1: why would human beings. I read science fiction so that there's this chinese writer, chicks in lieu is his name. I might not pronounce it exactly right Ci X I N L I U chicks in lieu. He has a trilogy of the three body problem, The dark forest and deaths end. Those are the three books of chicks in liu's trilogy about how try Solaris, which is another star system within a few light light years of the solar system and earth get into a conflict and when the tri Solaris come down to dominate earth. Suddenly all of these differences between the ([Time 1:13:16](https://www.airr.io/quote/629a234ce6f4a6f5a9584fb6))
- Speaker 1: and the emphasis should be on the american. I actually don't even much care for the framing african american, but I'm not going to fight with people about it. It's, you know, I don't think it's worth fighting about. That's not how I would just say we're americans or if you want, we're black americans, we're certainly not african that is the african american population is a population of people who come into existence here in north America through the cauldron of slavery. There are also immigrants, immigrants from East Africa immigrants from West Africa immigrants from Southern Africa ([Time 1:18:50](https://www.airr.io/quote/629a23d2e6f4a6f5a958645d))
- Speaker 1: about slavery. I'm in in brief brief because in fact slavery was awful and it was wrong and it was on the backs of the enslaved Africans and it had consequences that endured that have endured long after the termination of the thing. But I also want to say, Look at what has happened in the last 150 years for African Americans. And I want to say, look at the vitality of the institutions here in the United States of America, of the Democratic Republic of the United States of America. Again, not perfect, which are, which are malleable enough. These institutions to allow for the transformation of the status of african americans such ([Time 1:23:46](https://www.airr.io/quote/629ab508e6f4a6f5a96f38f8))
- Speaker 1: nation and I think we do best by beginning. We black americans do best by beginning. This is my argument in the piece by beginning, but from a framework which accepts that fact and then builds on it. 
  Speaker 0: So black patriotism is, it's not exactly the same. Rimes, echoes american patriotism. So a black american is first and foremost, an american, 
  Speaker 1: a black american is first and foremost an american and it's a good thing too. Yeah, 
  Speaker 0: let me return ([Time 1:25:45](https://www.airr.io/quote/629ab508e6f4a6f5a96f38f6))
- Speaker 1: shaped eyes that protruded and we're around Uncle Mooney James Ellis was his name. Uncle Mooney James Ellis lee, that was my uncle Mooney. But I'm saying all that to say this, he admired the nation of Islam, I mean king and Malcolm X, martin king and Malcolm X differed along a number of different dimensions. Malcolm X was a muslim 
  Speaker 0: and 
  Speaker 1: martin Luther King, Jr was a christian minister. My uncle Money didn't have any time for these christian ministers. He thought that was the white man's religion. He, you know, and back in that day you go into a black church and you'd see a portrait of jesus and he'd be of ([Time 1:30:12](https://www.airr.io/quote/629ab508e6f4a6f5a96f3906))
- Speaker 1: we're gonna build our own businesses. Uh we're we're not waiting for the white man to do anything, get your knee off my neck and get out of my way and let me take care of my own. And my uncle respected that. He respected the straight back, the stand up, straight with your shoulders back. That's a Jordan Peterson. But I mean that was the way before Jordan Peterson, but that was his philosophy. Stand up straight. But you raise your Children don't be depending upon welfare, you're taking welfare from the white man. You need to get busy, you need to educate yourself. You need to clean up your act, put down the fried chicken because it's gonna kill you. My uncle Mooney loved this book. That Elegy Mohammed. They called him the honorable Elijah Muhammad who was the founder ([Time 1:33:39](https://www.airr.io/quote/629ab508e6f4a6f5a96f391e))
- Speaker 1: yourself. You need to clean up your act, put down the fried chicken because it's gonna kill you. My uncle Mooney loved this book. That Elegy Mohammed. They called him the honorable Elijah Muhammad who was the founder and the leader of the nation of Islam. He had a book and all the book said was be smart, eat green vegetables, don't eat fried food. Uh don't eat pork. They're Muslims, don't eat pork uh and take responsibility for your diet and be healthy and uh you know, don't be putting a whole lot of pills into your body, You don't need to do that if you just get control of your diet and you know, you eat probably, you know, my uncle loves this idea of ([Time 1:34:09](https://www.airr.io/quote/629ab508e6f4a6f5a96f3915))
    - Note: Take care of your health, and don’t take welfare from the white man. Don’t be dependent on the white man.
- Speaker 0: what do you think about this word? Is it empowering? Is it destructive? What is it, what does it mean for race in America? Um, what does it mean that people like joe Rogan were essentially uh, there's an attack to 
  Speaker 1: cancel 
  Speaker 0: him for using the word 
  Speaker 1: just 
  Speaker 0: as a, as a scholar of human nature. What do you think about this whole thing? 
  Speaker 1: And this is a phenomenon that interests me. 
  Speaker 0: Okay 
  Speaker 1: at the end word ***, I can say it because I'm black, but I mean I can also say it because I like hip hop and when I listen to hip hop, I hear the word all the time. These *** ain't. Did ([Time 1:41:09](https://www.airr.io/quote/629ab508e6f4a6f5a96f390e))
- Speaker 1: I was growing up as a boy and a young man in Chicago *** ain't shit that was said. That was you know, the and that could be a reflection of some kind of pathology within the african american community of self hatred and so forth. It could be or it could just be a colloquial linguistic way. I mean I assume other groups also have their various, I don't know how the irish talk about their irish brothers and you know, whatever and um I don't know how the jews talk about the jewish brothers and whatever, but black people when talking about other black people use the N word all the time. My ***, 
  Speaker 0: N 
  Speaker 1: I G ([Time 1:42:00](https://www.airr.io/quote/629ab508e6f4a6f5a96f3925))
- Speaker 1: program at this university is because they scored lower on the test than other groups and they're not qualified. So say the professor gives a lecture and he says, we don't have more blacks in the physics department at this university because there are not enough qualified blacks. Somebody in the classroom who hears that a black student objects. He's a racist. Okay that's a power move. It's a move to try to control the conversation. It's not an argument. It's an epithet. You said that a person who has a particular idea that you don't like, maybe that idea is I'm against affirmative action. I think it's ([Time 1:47:38](https://www.airr.io/quote/629ab632e6f4a6f5a96f5dbe))
    - Note: It’s an epithet, not an argument
- Speaker 1: where he was invited M. I. T. Saying that he's a racist because he had that opinion. He gets disinvited Charles Murray. Um is a popular social science writer who is famous for his book about I. Q. The bell curve one chapter of which chronicles the racial differences between black and white in performance on mental ability tests and speculates about the extent to which such differences may be connected with the genetic inheritance of these racially distinct populations. Now he could be wrong about everything that he's saying. The Southern poverty Law ([Time 1:49:14](https://www.airr.io/quote/629ab657e6f4a6f5a96f63db))
- Speaker 1: philadelphia Washington D. C. Is out of control. Some person might say murder rate is high, who's committing those crimes. They're mostly black young men who are doing the carjackings and who are doing the shootings, they're killing each other, They're making our city unlivable unlivable. Now that's a hypothetical statement that I offer. It might be correct. It might be incorrect. It might be appropriate. It might be inappropriate. It may be true, but something that we would be better off if people didn't focus on, I don't know, responding to someone making that statement. Have you seen what has happened to my city? It used to be that you could go to north michigan ([Time 1:51:17](https://www.airr.io/quote/629ab686e6f4a6f5a96f692c))
- Speaker 1: responding to someone making that statement. Have you seen what has happened to my city? It used to be that you could go to north michigan avenue and you could find one after another after another high end shop. This is in Chicago, my hometown and tourists would come and they go to the theater and there were restaurants and they go out, they don't do it anymore. You know what? Half of those stores are boarded up now, you know why? Because when George Floyd was killed, black people mobbed in the city and they burnt and they rioted and they looted and it hasn't been the same ever since and I'm moving to the suburbs. I'll be damned if I'm going to send my Children to those schools. A person could say that they might be right. They might be wrong to say it. Calling them a racist is exactly ([Time 1:51:53](https://www.airr.io/quote/629ab694e6f4a6f5a96f6a90))
- Speaker 1: mobbed in the city and they burnt and they rioted and they looted and it hasn't been the same ever since and I'm moving to the suburbs. I'll be damned if I'm going to send my Children to those schools. A person could say that they might be right. They might be wrong to say it. Calling them a racist is exactly not rebuttal of what they said. It's a move, it's a move to try to take control of the conversation by accusing someone of having bad character because they said something that made you uncomfortable, which you can't deal with. So you think you can shut them up by calling them a racist. You might as well be calling them a witch, You might as well be calling for their head on a platter because they believe that satan is Lord because that's the kind of quote argument ([Time 1:52:21](https://www.airr.io/quote/629ab978e6f4a6f5a96fc261))
    - Note: It’s a move to try to take control of the conversation by accusing someone of having bad character because they said something that made you uncomfortable to shut them up. You might as well call them a witch
- Speaker 1: in black communities in the cities across this country by calling people a racist. You may shut them up, but you won't change their minds. And you know what, at the end of the day, they're going to go to the ballot box and they're gonna vote, they're going to pick up their store and they're going to move it to the other side of town or to another town altogether. They're gonna keep their Children away from places where they think the influences are harmful to those Children. They may not even talk about it in public. You can believe that in private that they're talking about it with each other. You had better find a more effective way of dealing with the conflicts in this country that fall along racial fault lines than calling people witches, which is what this um, You know, ([Time 1:53:33](https://www.airr.io/quote/629ab978e6f4a6f5a96fc26c))
    - Note: In the same way calling someone a witch is not an argument, calling someone racist is not an argument. It may shut people up, but it will not change their minds.
- Speaker 1: a historically legitimate reference to the descendants of the slaves, enslaved people, which we were as black americans proud to use until yesterday. So all of this linguistic policing is a sign of weakness. It's false. Black power. People will cede you the ground. Okay. You don't want me to use that word. I wouldn't use that word anymore. Okay, you don't want me to talk about that in public. Alright. I won't talk about it in public anymore. I don't want to be called a racist. Okay, so I won't express my opinion. You haven't changed anybody's mind, You know? So, 
  Speaker 0: and you've also mentioned that for that you haven't changed anybody's mind, but also for things like in universities and ([Time 1:54:57](https://www.airr.io/quote/629ab979e6f4a6f5a96fc290))
- Speaker 1: soviet union in the 19 thirties when they were in college, they might have voted for the Socialist candidate, Henry Wallace in the presidential election of 1948 they might belong to the Communist Party, they might think Karl Marx was right about a whole lot of stuff about capitalism and whatnot. And they got called a communist or a Marxist and it could have ruined their career, could have ruined their lives. Um you know, and a lot of people shut up about it and it took and it went on for a long time, uh and in a way, and in a way it's kind of still is going on, I mean, you call somebody a Marxist if if you can make that stick, they're certainly not going to get elected president of the United States, but I don't know about this. Um I ([Time 2:01:25](https://www.airr.io/quote/629abcd1e6f4a6f5a97035ec))
    - Note: Calling someone a Marxist, Communist,
- Speaker 1: who says that the emperor is naked is not that he's saying it, it's not even that other people hear him saying it, it's that everybody knows that everybody else heard him say it okay. The kid who speaks out and says the emperor has no clothes creates a circumstance in which it's common knowledge that the emperor has no clothes. Now, common knowledge does not just mean knowledge. It does not even mean widespread knowledge, it means comprehensive knowledge of other person's knowledge of the thing. Okay, so the spiral of silence is equilibrium that is susceptible to being undermined by a process of, of kind of cumulative process, a snowballing ([Time 2:04:12](https://www.airr.io/quote/629c1c38c33145d679e3c513))
- Speaker 0: the right person to understand it from a social scientist perspective from an economics perspective, but nobody really understands and it's fascinating within that domain. How do you allow for free speech not allow for free speech, encourage free speech to defend free speech and at the same time manage millions of ongoing conversations from just becoming insanely chaotic sort of from from twitter perspective, they want people to be happy to grow to actually have difficult critical conversations and they, you know, the problem with humans is they think they ([Time 2:10:26](https://www.airr.io/quote/629c1cbdc33145d679e3d6b9))
    - Note: Managing difficult conversations in Twitter
- Speaker 1: through the southern hemispheric populations that were dominated in the process of the colonizing thing. It's complicated. I'm not taking that position by the way, I'm just saying somebody at a university should be able to take it up and pursue it and engage in arguments with people about it. I'm talking about race and ethnicity, but this extends to a wide range of things supposedly talking about climate. And one person says the earth is endangered because carbon in global warming, etcetera. Seven and another person says, no, wait, no, wait, 
  Speaker 0: look 
  Speaker 1: At where we stand in the 21st century were vastly richer than our ancestors. Just 250 years ago, we have much more knowledge about that and so forth, and so on. 250 years from now, ([Time 2:16:14](https://www.airr.io/quote/629d41b8c33145d6790ca203))
- Speaker 1: that person is a climate denier. They can't pursue that area of inquiry uh, is against the spirit of the university. I think the barbarians at the gates has to do with the people who think they know what the right side of history is and try to make the university stand on the right side of history. My position is, you don't know what the right side of history is and the purpose of a university is to equip you to be able to think about what is the right side of history, What is the solution to the dilemmas that confront us as human beings living on this planet with the billions that we are in the condition that we are. So ([Time 2:17:37](https://www.airr.io/quote/629d41b8c33145d6790ca201))
    - Note: The barbarians at the gates, and the role believing there is a right side of history
- Speaker 1: between people with different visual acuity uh indicates. But finally, I've said, yes, research on racial differences in I. Q. Can foster um uh political beliefs that we would regard to be um Obnoxious on the other hand, to presume that what we don't know yet and might find out from the research is going to be harmful is to assume a kind of presumption or of knowing what the outcome of unknown processes might be, which we ought to be very slow to embrace because if we had done so in the past, we wouldn't have nuclear power. Uh, there's a lot of things that we wouldn't know. I mean, what were people saying about Darwin and ([Time 2:32:22](https://www.airr.io/quote/629fa9c8d2fdb8f63fce6493))
    - Note: To presume that the outcome of the research is harmful is to presume that we know the outcome of said unknown processes
- Speaker 1: policy and so on. Um and I found a lot to admire uh in the supply siders. The people were saying, you know, let's get the government out of the way, The people who are worried about national debt, which is a lot more now than it was then. The people who are worried that the welfare state could be too big, that the incentives of transfer programs could be counterproductive. That you had a war on poverty and we did have a war on poverty and poverty won. And there's a lot of evidence that the war on poverty was lost by the people who were trying to quote unquote, eradicate poverty in our time, um that uh incentives really do matter. And that the state which is driven by politics is ([Time 2:43:35](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a09e153f707348d6ef794d))
    - Note: We lost the war on poverty
- Speaker 1: trepidation. I don't take any pleasure and saying it, but here's what I'm talking about. So I'm talking about the family. So the family is a matter internal to the community about how men and women relate to each other and engage in social reproduction. Childbearing, the standing up of households. The context within which Children are developed, are maturing and so forth, and so on. So the african american family is in trouble. I think I can demonstrate that by reference to high rates of marital dissolution, uh, by high rates of birth to out of wedlock and so forth. Um, you can't even say that the african american family is in 
  Speaker 0: trouble. 
  Speaker 1: Violence, homicide is an order of magnitude more prevalent amongst african americans than it is in the society as a whole. This is behavior, its behavior of our people. I speak of black people of course, were not the only people in society for whom violence is an issue. It's an order of magnitude more prevalent uh, in our communities. I'm talking about schooling and school failure. So we have affirmative action as a cover. It's a band aid on differences in the development of intellectual ([Time 2:46:45](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a09f613f707348d6efbd59))
    - Note: The Black family is in trouble
- Speaker 1: the failures of African Americans to seize the opportunities that exist for us now in the 21st century, but did not exist In the first half of the 20th century. The way in which the civil rights movement has become uh, an avoidance mechanism for us not taking, We african americans responsible. This is glenn Lowry. Not everybody's going to agree with it. Uh is part of what makes me conservative. I am tired of the belly aching. I'm tired of the, excuse me white supremacy. It is in my mind a joke. I lament the fact that that kind of rhetoric is so seductively attractive to african americans and so widely ([Time 2:49:12](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a09f613f707348d6efbd68))
    - Note: The civil rights movement has shifted into an avoidance measure for taking responsibility , as opportunities increase from the first half to second half of 20th century
- Speaker 1: a joke. I lament the fact that that kind of rhetoric is so seductively attractive to african americans and so widely adopted by others. Um and as I am fond of saying at the end of the day, nobody is coming to save us. I mean higher education, M I. T. Caltech stanford uh the where the future is happening. That is about mastery over the achievements of human civilization Such as they manifest themselves in the 21st century. There's no substitute for actually acquiring mastery over the material. There's no ([Time 2:49:46](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a09f613f707348d6efbda0))
- Speaker 1: over the achievements of human civilization Such as they manifest themselves in the 21st century. There's no substitute for actually acquiring mastery over the material. There's no substitute for that could be patronized. They have the standards lowered, They want to get rid of the test. They want to tell african americans, the pats on the head, we're gonna have a separate program for you. We're gonna give you a side door that you can come into. That doesn't make us any smarter. It doesn't make us any more creative. Um and it doesn't make us any more fit for the actual competition that's unfolding before us. Now. You want to be ([Time 2:50:17](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a09f613f707348d6efbdb5))
    - Note: Side programs
- Speaker 1: Um and it doesn't make us any more fit for the actual competition that's unfolding before us. Now. You want to be 10% of the population that's carried along for the next 100 years. You want to be a ward of the state In the late 21st century. You go ahead because the chinese are coming. You're not gonna hold them back. The world is being remade every decade by new ways of seeing and new ways of doing. If you don't get on board with the dynamic advancement of the civilization in which we are embedded, you're gonna end up being dependent on other people to look kindly upon you in this story that you've got this belly ache, ([Time 2:50:52](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a09f613f707348d6efbdb3))
    - Note: You don’t want to be dependent on others as the world changes (the China is coming)
- Speaker 1: affirmative action. I don't just disagree with it. I don't just think it's Against the 14th Amendment. I hate it. The hatred comes from an understanding that it is a band aid that it is a substitute for the actual development of capacities of our people to compete. I'd much rather be in the position of having them try to keep me out because I'm so damn good. Like they're doing with the asians than having them have to beg the Supreme Court to allow for a special dispensation on my behalf because they need diversity and inclusion and belonging. It's not just diversity. It's not just diversity and inclusion and diversity and inclusion and belonging. I'm whining because I feel like I don't belong.

    - Note: The case against Affirmative Action, the position of weakness, rather be in the opposite position
- Speaker 1: What I disliked was the pandering, he was seeking votes from black people by pandering to us and he's treating us like Children. Why should I care what color the person is, who's on the United States Supreme Court. What I should care about is what kind of opinions are going to write when they're on the United Do I suppose that being a black woman means that you're going to write different kinds of opinions than others? Well perhaps perhaps uh that kind of identity politics at the highest level of american legal establishment is something that rubs me very much the wrong way. What I should care about is the ([Time 2:55:59](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a09fc13f707348d6efcd6d))
- Speaker 1: to the kinds of opinions that they're going to write. So I mean, I think uh joe biden this is just a piece of a larger political strategy to cobble together a coalition that will be successful at the polls and sustaining democrats. Jim Crow 2.0 this whole characterization of the conflict in the states about election security and voting rights is another part of that strategy. He is pandering to black voters. He is trying to frighten us thinking that if the republicans win our rights will be taken away. Um, and I ([Time 2:57:28](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a09fd83f707348d6efd305))
    - Note: Jim Crow 2.0
- Speaker 1: of the skin, of a person who is serving in government as they are about the content of their character and the focus of their, of their political and ideological orientation which for me would be center or even center right, but that's me 
  Speaker 0: and should not have a significant impact. Nevertheless, he said she can overcome the asterix, but to me it was deeply disrespectful that um anyone would give an extra abstract stuff to overcome. He 
  Speaker 1: didn't have to say it. All, he had to do was do it. If he wanted to put a black woman on the court that he could just go ahead and done it. The reason, he said it is because he wanted black people to vote for him by saying it and I'm saying that treats us like we're Children. 
  Speaker 0: Uh you know, it's not a political statement, I ([Time 2:58:23](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a09ffd3f707348d6efd99c))
- Speaker 1: that kind of thing. But Tom is also a social historian and of philosopher in the tradition of a Friedrich von Hayek. Uh one of Tom's books, I've deeply admired knowledge and decisions is an extension of the hierarchy and arguments about the limits of central planning and whatnot. So I think tom sold thomas 
  Speaker 0: soul 
  Speaker 1: african american born as I understand it, in Louisiana, raised in new york city, a graduate of Harvard College, a military veteran, um a PhD in economics from the University of Chicago, um a black ([Time 3:02:47](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a0a0673f707348d6f0038a))
    - Note: Thomas Sowell and the Nobel Prize
- Speaker 1: and the first black vice president of the United States, neither of them descend from american slaves. Um, Kamala Harris's father is of african ancestry in part, he's a Jamaican immigrant and her mother is an indian immigrant, She was Kamala Harris um raised up largely in Canada. Um they're born in the United States. Um Barack Obama is, as I've said of mixed ancestry and neither of his parents are the descendants of uh, of american descendants of african slaves. But ([Time 3:05:44](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a0a11b3f707348d6f0240f))
    - Note: Kamala Harris and Barrack Obama are both from different backgrounds
- Speaker 0: is skin color. 
  Speaker 1: Yeah, 
  Speaker 0: I mean he Barack Obama is black when it matters when you're talking to a white supremacist, when you're talking to, when you, if you're a slave owner, he's black, just like you said when Hitler comes around a jew is a jew, it doesn't matter how you identify, it doesn't matter what, so in that sense don't you think that Barack Obama is black in the most powerful of ways, which is designating how far the MLK the doctor King vision. 
  Speaker 1: Oh sure. And look, ([Time 3:07:08](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a0a1193f707348d6f023d9))
    - Note: Black is black in the same way a Jew is a Jew
- Speaker 1: you can do stuff that nobody else could do. You're a black president. You could tell the people burning down the city to get their butts back in their houses and to stop it. 
  Speaker 0: You 
  Speaker 1: know, you could tell the race hustlers 
  Speaker 0: the 
  Speaker 1: Al Sharpton to the world. Not only has our time come for those who supported my campaign, your time is over for those who want to carry on uh a advocacy rooted in racial grievance, the election of myself to this highest office proves that the institution of the state are legitimate and open to all ([Time 3:10:06](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a0a1193f707348d6f023e3))
    - Note: What Obama could have done
- Speaker 1: and then sent his attorney general eric holder out to enforce this narrative, he doubled down on a racial narrative that I think is actually false. I think the story that systemic racism in America as reflected in policing that terrorizes black people because of the color of their skin is demonstrably false. I think that the central threat 
  Speaker 0: to 
  Speaker 1: black lives is violent crime perpetrated largely by black people against other black people. I think there is such a thing as police brutality and I think there are reasons to have regulations of police, but I think it is a second order issue in terms of ([Time 3:11:20](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a0a1a63f707348d6f048ae))
    - Note: Police brutality in contrast to black on black crime
- Speaker 1: so 
  Speaker 0: to push back a little bit. 
  Speaker 1: Yeah, good 
  Speaker 0: pushback. I think you're asking Barack Obama, the first black president of the United States to do the thing that I think should be done by the second black President of the United States. I think his very example given the color of her skin uh was the most powerful thing. And um actually doing some of these hard thomas soul type of glen larry type of strong words about race. It may be too much to ask given the nature of modern day politics. He is a politician, he 
  Speaker 1: is a politician. He needed to get elected, he needed to get reelected. ([Time 3:12:54](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a0a1a63f707348d6f048df))
    - Note: Should Obama have encouraged blacks people to not riot? And is this something the second black president should do?
- Speaker 1: too deserves to be in that pantheon. He is not by the custodians of american education. Clarence thomas name is not on that many schools. Barack Obama's name will be on many of them. I'm not equating them, they're different people. The offices are very different but the same logic that you just used to extol the significance of Barack Obama's ascendancy could and should be applied to Clarence thomas in my opinion. 
  Speaker 0: Yes, but you know it's it's the office but also um there's a resume and there's accomplishments but then there is oratory and charisma and a number of twitter followers. Uh So there's ability to captivate ([Time 3:16:46](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a0a2eb3f707348d6f08ab9))
    - Note: Clarence Thomas should be as respected as Obama
- Speaker 0: that's a skill that correlates but it's not directly connected to with how impressive your resume is, 
  Speaker 1: I agree and moreover, the judicial function. The judge doesn't go out and give speeches of that sort because it's exactly antithetical to what he's doing. He's a custodian of the law and that's not a popular uh feature figure in american policy. It doesn't stand for election and it's a good thing too. So I I take that point here. I want to say something else though. That's provocative the next black president. You say first black president shouldn't have been the one to do that. The second one should is more likely than not going to be a Republican. I'm not, I don't have a particular person in mind. I'm just saying, I agree. I agree. I agree. ([Time 3:17:34](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a0a2eb3f707348d6f08ab0))
    - Note: The second black president has a good chance of being Republican
- Speaker 1: to be afraid of death. Why should I fear death? Death is coming to all of us the the point of being afraid. I mean I'm wasting my time fearing something that I have no ultimate control over. It's irrational to be afraid of death. 
  Speaker 0: Uh yeah, because it, you can't predict when it happens. You only know that it 
  Speaker 1: happens. 
  Speaker 0: So why be afraid 
  Speaker 1: and therefore live everyday, fully live everyday purposefully. Um you know, and so on, but these are all just words, you know, I I don't want to die, I want to live forever. I'm not gonna live forever. I don't want to, I don't want to suffer. I I see people suffering. I saw my late wife, ([Time 3:30:20](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a0a3073f707348d6f09158))
    - Note: It’s a waste of time to worry about death
- Speaker 1: of the matter is this is me and I'm lying here and I'm dying, this is the end of me, how are you gonna do anything other than dread the end of me. So let's acknowledge that I don't want to die. Okay, I'm just gonna tell you that up front, but that is not the end of my death is not the end of life. I have lived well and fully. Uh I will go and do my best right up until the end. Uh I will accept what is inevitable. Uh and I will hold out this belief and he's a christian minister. So he holds out this belief and he knows he knows that the belief is not rational. It's not a reasoned, deductive scientific conclusion. It's spiritual in the most ([Time 3:33:36](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a0a49d3f707348d6f0d278))
