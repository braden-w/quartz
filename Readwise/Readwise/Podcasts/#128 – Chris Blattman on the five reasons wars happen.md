## Highlights
- The Inefficient Thing is Arming
  Summary:
  Three or four per cent of global g d p is spent on militaries directly. The interesting thing is that we spend all this money, actually, liking, training soldiers and buying all this equipment and so on. 99 % of the time, the soldiers are just sitting there, not ei in any actual war at all. Right? So the thing the w're not saying is that people weren't by armaments. The the thing that your modelling implies is that they'll rarely actually be used.

  Speaker 1
  acrimoniously. Both out violets,
  Speaker 2
  yes, i was thinking about how to answer answerter this question. I guess you have. I think somhing ike three or four % othing of global g d p is spent on militaries directly. The interesting thing is that we spend all this money, actually, liking, training soldiers and buying all this equipment and so on, and yet, 99 % of the time, the soldiers are just sitting there, not ei in any actual war at all. Right? So the thing the w're not saying is that people weren't by armaments. The the thing that your modelling implies is that they'll rarely actually be used. I
  Speaker 1
  mean, this is iting one of the big insights, just from strategic analysis, or game theory in general, which is that most of the time fighting doesn't happen because it's really inefficient, and there's a better way to obtain that. But the big inefficient thing that does happen is armin right? That unless we can find till i commit really sofdly to commit one another to disarm that we're just going to invest an enormous amount of social resources in that. And that's really hard to avoid. I mean, i think that's what when we do have states, when we do have alliances, that partly solves the problem. So, you know, you think about the western hemisphere, wehare the united states.

- Are We Biased Towards Personal Emotions in Large Scale Conflict?
  Summary:
  We tend to take our interpersonal violence and then we project that on to nations. That's a good example of one that i think is maybe overstated. And also, or our tendency what i call projection bias, as we then project that onto other situations may be erroneously so. It's these biases to have persistently erroneous beliefs that really matter in group behavior and individual behavior.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yes.
  Speaker 2
  Oh, so
  Speaker 1
  that's, that's a good example of one that i think is maybe overstated. Wed, tend to take our interpersonal violence and then we project that on to nations. And thn, i don't think that's a good guide. Yes.
  Speaker 2
  Whent we read that prt of the book, iston thing, why would it be that people are biase towards thinking about kind of personal emotions in the driver of large scale conflict? And an two things jump to mind. One is that, you know, the thing that we have experience o all the time is inter personal interactions, like our interactions with our spouse, our interactions with our boss, wewere these personal feelings are our more key. And so weare putting this analogy up to a much bigger scale. And
  Speaker 1
  that there is, to me, aversion of the availability byasing, that we take what's available and we think that's more common. And also, or our tendency what i call projection bias, as we then project that onto other situations, may be erroneously so. What it is, as we actually form and hold strenuously on to erroneous beliefs despite contrary evidence. And
  Speaker 2
  that
  Speaker 1
  not the passions. It's our ability to sort of draw the wrong conclusion from incomplete information and then project it to other people in situations that is the misperception. That's one of the things, that's one of our on one of these causes of war. It's these biases to have persistently erroneous beliefs that really matter in group behavior and individual behavior, and the passions fade away.

- Personal Incentives for Founding Fathers in The American Revolution
  Summary:
  i wanted to use something that was counter intuitive for people. It's really easy to sort of think o that liberian warlord. Of course, he said, we would never do that. And i wanted to take one of the most iconically high integrity characters in history and point out that even they were somewhat unchecked. Most of the founding fathers had a big economic stake in independence,. trade and an tax policy with britain.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Riht,
  Speaker 1
  so, i mean, i don't think this is the primary explanation for the american revolution. But i think we we can't ignore it because it's a factor. And i wanted to use something that was counter intuitive for people. It's really easy to sort of think o that liberian warlord. Of course, he said, we would never do that. And i wanted to sort of take one of the most iconically high integrity characters in history and sort of point out that even they were somewhat unchecked. Because certainly once, evenl certainly after revolution was run, most americans didn't vote, couldn'tvote. Certainly they weren't holding george washington and the other founding fathers fully accountable in the years running up to the revolution. And what's interesting, and many historians have noted, is that most of the founding fathers had a big economic stake in independence, or a very particular lena, trade and an tax policy with britain. It's no coincidence. And coincident, a lot of the people who remained loyalists had economic stakes in union with britain and with the british policies that britain wanted to impose on the united states. And so that surely influenced, along with all the other more noble motives that played a role, both in their willingness to launch the revolution, but had also played a role his. Washington was a notorious land speculator. He was a consumer. Wanted the fanciest clothes, the fanciest carriages, the land trappings of wealth. He pursued tat his entire life. And his pursuit of that land wealth is one of the things that set off the french and indian wars. ([Time 0:39:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ac13e6a5-c60a-441a-9ffd-63b5a9ecad93))
- The Intangible Incentive
  Summary:
  There is some value that you ved through violence, like glory, or that only violence could deliver you. In all these stories, as different as they are, share this similar logic,. Wasn't like the material country or territory or economy or policy space that you were battling over. And so our intransigence on a principle is a kind of intangible incentive.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Yet,
  Speaker 1
  this is like a really diverse category in n so never label. I loved and so intangible in sentis was the best of a bad bunch that i ain't captured. You could think of it as violence is a terminal category. But you could also think of it as violence just the thing that you value is actually not violence, but it's something that only violence can deliver. And so glory is an example. Vengeance is another example. There may be certain nationalist or ethnic or religious ideals about extending the power of your group, exterminating the heretic, exterminating the heretical view racial purity. So these have been more or less noble, many of them less noble, throughout history. In all these stories, as different as they are, share this similar logic, which is there was something ethereal. Wasn't like the material country or territory or economy or policy space that you were battling over. There is some value that you ved through violence, like glory, or that only violence could deliver you. But maybe the more important one, i think, for understanding a lot of conflicts, especially a lot of contemporary conflicts, which is also an intangible incentive, is that there's some ideal that we hold that we refuse to compromise on. So the ucranians refuse to compromise on their liberty. The american revolutionaries refuse to compromise on their liberty. And the tolibon refused to compromise, not so much on their liberty, but on a set of principles. The american administration, when dealing with the tolybon refused to compromise on a certain set of principles of justice and of a punishment of a grave crime. And so our intransigence on a principle is a kind of intangible incentive that essentially says, well, there's a bargain to be made that we should accept semi sovereignty as an american revolutionary or as a eucranian, because they are strong and we are weak, and i refuse. That is the sensible compromise. ([Time 0:42:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8e43d476-2346-445c-9b13-ef18ddb740bc))

- Commitment Problem
  Summary:
  The fourth underlying driver of orlenci list co commitmen problems is kind of the inability to commit not abuse your power in future. Can you explain how this kind of commitment problem can it might help explain why world well ont occured?
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Ya, the
  Speaker 2
  fourth underlying driver of orlenci list co commitmen problems is kind of the inability to commit not abuse your power in future. Basically, if you have two actors, and one is quickly becoming more powerful than the other, then the rising party would probably like to commit to not take too much of the pie, to not exploit the other party in future, because that would stop them from being attacked now. But no matter, no matter what they say, the declining power knows that it's going to be in the rising power's interest to take advantage of them in future. And so now the rising power could basically try to directly pay off the declining power now yeout to attack them, which which does apparently often happen. But if the rise, if their risin power, is too steep, then they may just not be able to afford sufficiently large payout to motivate the declining power not to engage in a preenptive strike in order to stop their rise. Can you explain how this kind of commitment problem can it might help explain why world well ont occured. True
  Speaker 1
  e, i should say, like it sounds like an esoteric concept in your lig what is that really and i think it's actually so fundamental to understanding so many ([Time 1:02:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fbe5cadc-ec0a-43d1-a95f-0a2e131d83ea))
- Athens, Sparta and the Third Party
  Summary:
  Sparta was getting very skittish about what athens might do in future when they're more powerful. Athens could be in favour of that third party allying with sparta, so that sparta is less concerned about the rise of athens. The preferred solution wen actually for this third power, crosira, to remain neutral, neutral. And it was just a very difficult path to walk.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Yet, in that ancient greek example, i guess the stylized description is that athens was this rising power. Sparta was kind of declining relative to o athens. And so they were getting very skittish, though, geting very nervous about what athens might do in future when they're more powerful in dressing things. Because there was this third party, this kind of third balancing power. Athens could be in favour of that third party allying with sparta, so that sparta is less concerned about the rise of athens, because they be balanced in future, and so won't feel the need to launch a preemptive attack on athens. Like that this third party, like, makes a commitment kind of credible, or is a way of trading off something. Now, so the spotte doezen doesn't have to worry.
  Speaker 1
  I mean, they didn't want o, mean that this the neutral power, had the second largest navy after athens. So they didn't naturally want that would be that would not be their preferred solution. The preferred solution wen actually for this third power, crosira, to remain neutral, neutral. And they tried to maintain that. So as carser tried to pull them into some of their disputes and things, the athenians resisted, and they tried to be neutral observers. And it was just a very difficult path to walk.

- Terrorism is the Weapon of the Weakest
  Summary:
  The model that you present in the book is kind of this dividing pie thing. Which is a nice simplification, but it seems like more often in conflict, a small group would almost certainly lose a war because they dislike it so much. I think what you end up getting is, i think you then start to understand things like terrorism better. Terrorism is the weapon of the weakest. It's the way that you exercise bargaining power verses an incredibly strong foe.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  regressions. Begaut the hol groupaly i guss, we had to pause in 19 92, or separat the model that you present in the book is kind of this dividing pie thing. And for simplicity in the book, you kind of conceptualize things in terms of, you know, different groups have different levels of power, and that changes their probability of winning the war and getting te the whole pie, at least the whole pie that's remaining after the destruction of the war. Which is a nice simplification, but it seems like, you know, more often in conflict, a small group would almost certainly lose a war because they dislike it so much, so much weaker. And instead of what's going on is that they have some ability to harm a much more powerful party, even if they can't like actually winner, we win a pitch battle. Tus. Thinking about dividing up the pie more in proportion to how much you can harm someone else, rather than your chance of winning an outright war. Can it change anything important about the conclusions that that spit out? You know,
  Speaker 1
  generally no. I think i thn that's why i could make the simplification, as most of the things we get are intact. I think, i think what you end up getting is, i think you then start to understand things like terrorism better. Terrorism is the weapon of the weakest. It's the way that you exercise bargaining power verses an incredibly strong foe. Not because you think the terrists are going to manage to take over the country, very seldom happens, butthe leverage violence against civilians, but the fear of violence, to obtain concessions or obtain some other aim. And so so i think it helps you to understand a greater variety of violence, but a lot of the same, the same principles, the idea that peace is optimal, and thatin a lot of the five sources of breakdown still play.

- Invading Iraq to Signal Resolve to Other Actors
  Summary:
  i think it's hard get to a long war from that. i don't think we can understand the america, America's 20 year war without thinking about how they were trying to signal resolve and move every other bargaining game in their favour. Ya, ye, that's the thing that can make a lot of sense, isuppose of how you would be willing to bear such huge costs. Because, lk, why would you go into a total war just to show that you feelits like you you're losing everything? T a yu, were trying to protect. Y, so you need to have some like, broader considerations that are beyond the scope of that in order to
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yes, i think it does make sense. I think, i think it's hard get to a long war from that. I think the escalation, escalation, escallation, and both being willing to do that is improbable enough that. But except in a world where it goes back to this multiplayer games, where everyone's watching, everyone's watching. And so, you know, if i'm set on husane facing the us. As i point out in the book, like i i was really struck by, and now, i don't remember which historian pointed out, was that in sanam's mind, the us. Wasn't even enemy number one or enemy number two. Wasn't even enemy number three. Sanam, san was chiefly worried about aran. He was working about who was worrid about the sheites. He was worried about israel and and they were all watching what saram would do. And likewise, when the united states was trying to convince the talabon government of afghanistan that we'll invade you don't hand over laden both the talibon were thinking about their reputation, but more importantly, i think the united states was thinking about every other potential enemy, conventional or terrorist, that would be watching to see what they do. And so i don't think we can understand the america, america's 20 year war, and i don't think we can understand sdam husein's branksmanship, or the bush decision to invade rok without thinking about how they were trying to, in an uncertain world, signal resolve to a wider audience in order to move every other bargaining game a little bit in their favour.
  Speaker 2
  Ya, ye, that's the thing that can make a lot of sense, isuppose of how you would be willing to bear such huge costs. Because, lk, why would you go into a total war just to show that you feelits like you you're losing everything? T a yu, were trying to protect. Y, so you need to have some like, broader considerations that are beyond the scope of that in order to make sense of the costthink maybe let's come back to that, ecause i wonder, i want to talk a bit about the the war in ukrane, and like what we've gotten right and wrong, and maybe like how these haw these modeals get applied to that, beyond what we've already already talked about.

- The War in Ukraina
  Summary:
  I'm not totally persuaded by him. I thinkhe, i can't quite convince myself he's fully right. But it's a good example. It's a totally plausible state of the world. We learn from this is going to depend on what was actually going on. And we don't have a clearing diagnosis right now beause there's so many mysteries. So i suppose, ye, you might disagree about which of the five drivers is doing most of the work. There's kind of a question like, how personal is aversus a how strategic is it?
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I mean, we don't, we don't really know what's going and rell a good example. Ihave a russian colleague who as eminent game theorist and and was once the head of one of the most eminent universities in moscow. He's now here, who has a completely different view than mine. He gets obviously a more information right. But he he's, despite being a strategic thinker and someone who studies rtegic thinkers, he thinks this is very irrational. It's all misperceptions and intangible incentives in an insular, degenerated inner circle around putton. I don't know if that's right. I'm not totally persuaded by him. I certainly think it's a role. I thinkhe, i can't quite convince myself he's fully right. Not everyone agrees with him, even who are other experts. But it's a good example. It's a totally plausible state of the world. We learn from this is going to depend on what was actually going on, because i can, i can articulate, and i have here, like the strategic logic of the invasion, especially russia strategic logic to invade makes even more sense in like a cold, calculated, brutal way, but in a real politic no kind of sense. It makes sense given if if the cranians are the noble, nobly and transigent defenders of liberty, then the compromise, then you're just going to have to seize it is is the rational just like that was maybe the qo correct decision for the can in the american revolution. So, but, but if if i'm wrong, and my colleague is right, that they're just not thinking strategically at all, that means that any solution that follows my advice would be a terrible one. A likewise, any if he's wrong, any solution that follows his advice would be a terrible one. It's a little bit like going back to our doctrinalogy, ye, like you have to have the treatment sints the disease. And we don't have a clearing diagnosis right now beause there's so many mysteries. Yes.
  Speaker 2
  So i suppose, ye, you might disagree about which of the five drivers is doing most of the work. And there's kind of a question like, how personal is aversus a how strategic is it? ([Time 1:43:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/90c8e118-5d07-4250-9858-d6d647a280ab))
- The Story Behind Every Proxy War
  Summary:
  Russia's divide and conquer strategy with its neighbors has been working. But they've not had any mechanism by which they can band together to collectively resist this a. So we're fighting a proxy war hin crane. It's a nobler proxy war than most proxy wars, but every proxy war is the product of unchecked interest because there's some super power or some neighboring power fuelling one side of the conflict.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So so first of all, i think russia's divide and conquer strategy with its neighbors has been working. Andad they've not had any mechanism by which they can band together to collectively resist this a. That's all. So, you know, tim fry has a brush expert at columbia university, as a fabulous book published last year, where he also talks. But that's how puten, that's how many dictators, including putton, av power and personalized power s. There's lots of oligarchs, there's lots of military generals, there's lots of powerful governors as but they were never banded together to collectively resist him. And so he was able to sort of divide and conquer. And so that's the stratage that works well for him. And now there is an alliance, the
  Speaker 2
  nativ alliance, plus ukraine,
  Speaker 1
  that is drawing a line, sort of, right? You know, the natives is really drawing that firm a line. They're supporting ukrane. They're not actually allies. They're not militarily getting involved. So you can understand maybe the westw ess to fuel this war on those terms. And that's, that's a kind of unchecked leaders or unchecked interests argument wright that says, listen, cranes are paying the costs, not us. It's really easy to draw a line in the sand if it's not our sand. It's the story behind every proxy war. So we're fighting a proxy war hin crane. It's a nobler proxy war than most proxy wars. But every proxy war is, in some ways the product of unchecked interest because there's some super power or some neighboring power that's fuelling one side of the conflict, even when it makes sense to deal from the perspective of those two very local warring parties. Ya, yes. ([Time 1:54:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0c30bfe2-33c5-42b2-bc58-871f687a55a0))
- Audience Costs
  Summary:
  The argument for escalation on the basis of trying to show how how fierce you are. From from nety's point of view, itrestin like russia internally can have a similar kind of argument. And if we back down now, then people are just never going to take our threats seriously again. Y, yes, i laid out just a second ago, of reputation, escalate.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Y, yes, i laid out just a second ago, of reputation, escalate. Lke the argument for escalation on the basis of trying to show how how fierce you are. From from nety's point of view, itrestin like russia internally can have a similar kind of argument, where they like while we deployed all our troops to the border and threatened to go to war. And if we back down now, then people are just never going to take our threats seriously again. So we have to go to war, even if wethin gets a mistake, in this case, just in order to let again, convince people that we're willing to go to war in future cases, people laughing our faces. Yes,
  Speaker 1
  that kind of face saving, if it's about signalling reputation can happen. I think it maybe a little exaggerated. And and all sides recognize this. And so finding ways that russia can save face or serve like a natural peace building strategy. But a special case of this is something political scientists call audience costs, which is that if we think that putton would be deposed if he lost, then on the one hand, you might think, great. Glad to see you go. On the other hand, that is an incentive for him to just keep fighting beyond where it makes any sense, whatever. And so thereisre's a certain logic to letting some one like putton not lose completely, and letting him say face, in order to paying price of knowing that the regime will not change, but at least it will end the war.

- Democracy Peace Theory
  Summary:
  The author is partly convinced on the basis of t idea that over centralized power accentuates all five kinds of conflict. He says democratic peace theory doesn't hold true for countries like liberia, where there's a dictator every five years. The most important check to peace building isn't an elected president but division of power across branches and levels of government," he writes.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So this is an ary where i think that the the theory ind a lot of the casual empirics are really strong, and then the hard tests are pretty rare, and or, you kno, difficult to believe, fully, but i'm partly convinced on the basis of t idea. In the casea, it goes back to this broader point about over centralized power being the root of accentuating all five kinds of conflict bicas mechanically is going to make leaders more inchecked and less likely internalized cost. But it means we're at the mercy of their misreceptions. We're at the mercy of their intangible incentives. There's more uncertainty. They can't commit, and so it just aggravates all thes arches of war. And i think that is, to me, a very plausible rational for why checked, highly checked and balanced societies very seldom go to war against any one, against one another. And when they do go to war, it's usually against a relatively unchecked society where they can't find a mutual bargaining range. But i'm careful to sort of talk in the book about these sort of checked and balance societies, rather democratic, because democratic people think t means, you know, most people s leap to thinking as the is the president elected or not? But then there's a lot of countries like liberia where wo're electing a dictator every five years. That's a slight exaggeration, but they're just not, they're not that checkd and balance. They have a lot of autonomy and and so an election for the executive is actually not the most important check for my prorspective for peace building. It's actually the division of power within the country, across branch os tho government, across levels of government in the country, anto these like supernational organizations. So anything that does that is going to make things more peaceable. So i totally by democratic peace theory. But the idea that it's just like some simple, oh, if we all had elections for president, we'd have a peaceful world, that that's not true. Yes, i guess.

- Hostage Taking to Prevent War
  Summary:
  We might have a very different no drug policy if we had to face some of the consequences that mexico and columbia have to face. It doesn't seem like we've come up with an amazing list of things that i feel like we can find in order to stop the risk of war between china and us. Is there no building ol or ipon? I'd rather if you said, do we want lafive five chinese hostages, or all our iphones get dealt in in and china and inchina than ii, i'd take the iphones. Yeindependence argument, right? But given that both sides in that conflict would regard it as catastrophic
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  see. So in the accountability story, that the point is that they, they haven't gone to war in a way that would harm the united states, because it's a democracy, and leaders would lose if that happened. But it's totally consistent with the story for them to harm people in other countries, ecause venezuelans don't get a vote,
  Speaker 1
  yes, and and we're quite willing to sort of support conflicts like many aspects of the drug war, if we can export some of the costs as well. Ere no t leno any that's true of any any group. So so we might have a very different no drug policy if we had to face some of the consequences that mexico and columbia have to face.
  Speaker 2
  A slightly facetious question. Back in history, kind of during a fourteenth, fifteent sixteenth century, my understanding is that countries would sometimes exfectively exchange hostages, that ane members of the nobility, in order to make it more costly to declare war on the other country, because then the hostages would be, would be killed, or at least would be at risk. Yo. They
  Speaker 1
  would also marry each other's children to when in r which is another kind of hostage takingqorin probably the eyes of some of these princesses and the people who were married off, ye, i'm not sure that they were getting a vote on that.
  Speaker 2
  It doesn't seem like we've come up with an amazing list of things that i feel like we can find in order to stop the risk of war between china and the us. But given that both sides in that conflict. Would regard it as catastrophic to have a war, i imagine. Is there
  Speaker 1
  no building ol or ipon. I'd rather if you said, do we want lafive five chinese hostages, or all our iphones get dealt in in and china and inchina than ii, i'd take the iphones. Yeindependence
