## Highlights
- Culture isn't About One Leader's Behavior
  Summary:
  Research suggests that the worst stories about a culture are about senior leaders violating their own principles. The company claims to value well being, but do they really mean it? If you want to get promoted early, good luck not working 17 days. But what if you are already inside? How do you build and maintain a strong culture? More on that after the break.

  Because inperson interactions are highly valued, according to the president of the firm. But the third move senior person at the firm is spending the entire winter in aski in europe. This is a red flag. Research suggests that the worst stories about a culture are about senior leaders violating their own principles. They claim in person relationships are valued, but apparently one of the top people is exempt from that value. Hypocrisy alert. You can also see signs of hypocrisy versus integrity. By asking a third question, tell me a story about who gets hired, promoted and fired around here. If you're a detective, these stories are full of clues about what's really valued. And
  Speaker 8
  emdy showed how he made d in six years as apposted the normal 12. He told us how he works from four 30 a m until ten p m, and is always available. He doesn't expect it from any one else, but he's always grinding. Considering our firm prides itself on ling mental health, it's a bit demoralizing to hear that the way to advance quickly is to abandon those values. Here's
  Speaker 1
  another warning signal. The company claims to value well being, but do they really mean it? If you want to get promoted early, good luck not working 17 days. Collecting stories can help you understand a culture from the outside and identify toxticity, mediocracy, bureaucracy and anarchy before you join. But what if you are already inside? How do you build and maintain a strong culture? More on that after the break. Ok, this is going to be a different kind of ad. I play a personal role in selecting the sponsors for this podcast, because they all have interesting cultures of their own ([Time 0:13:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/72fee5ca-5712-45b7-a845-162a2eab04ac))
- Culture is Twice as Important as Who You Hire
  Summary:
  When it comes to building a strong culture, socialization beats selection. The values and norms you set are more than twice as influential as who you hire. Culture isn't just communicated through the stories we tell. You want to find and share stories about a time when the culture became real.

  Ye,
  Speaker 1
  well, it's, it's interesting what you just describe dovetails very nicely with what we se in the research un on strong cultures, which s, you know, one townty people are more attracted to them because there's a clear signal, this is who we are, this is what we stand for. And that differentiates youen the market place to ihten motivation over and over againlik, i'm not just doing a job. I'm advancing a mission. And those two things obviously feed into attention nicely. And they do that in part through a sense of belongingik, when when the culture is strong, like everybody shares the same values, and also, is passionat about the same values as me. And i can't imagine working anywhere else, because how am i going to find that again? Yes, yes. So how do you create that kind of commitment and build a strong organizational culture? In her research, jenny compared the effects of selection versus socialization. How much of culture is who you let on the bus versus how you drive it?
  Speaker 2
  It turns out that people are, within some parometers, pretty, pretty flexible in terms of how much they can grow to adapt and fit with, or even appreciate the culture that they're a part of. Well,
  Speaker 1
  i think you just said that socialization eats selection for breakfast. That's right. That's
  Speaker 2
  right. Which, which is interesting, because i think if you asked most leaders, they would say it's about about who you hire. And it turns out that people are actually more adaptable than we give them credit for. Jenny
  Speaker 1
  finds that when it comes to building a strong culture, socialization beats selection. The values and norms you set are more than twice as influential as who you hire. So if you want to strengthen your culture, the first step is to bring it to life. For people, especially new hires. Culture isn't just communicated through the stories we tell. It's created through the stories we tell. You want to find and share stories about a time when the culture became real.
  Speaker 2
  Stories are vital. I like to advise leaders to see themselves as curators of key stories within organizations. You need to tell the story, but also give the moral of the story. ([Time 0:27:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/02a3be05-db84-42c9-a5df-3c6082ad57e4))

- The Story of Southwest Airlines
  Summary:
  Leaders should see themselves as curators of key stories within organizations. Research reveals that the most powerful stories are about people living your values. Once you've identified your best culture stories, reward and promote protagonists in them.

  Stories are vital. I like to advise leaders to see themselves as curators of key stories within organizations. You need to tell the story, but also give the moral of the story. And so one very well known example is southwest airlines. They were running out of money early in their operations. They were using four jets at the time, and they couldn't make their pay roll. So they had to sell one of the jets to pay employees that month. And they went to employees and said, we're going to sell one of our jets, but we want to run the same routes with three jets instead of four. How can we do that? And employees came back with the idea of turning the planes more quickly than they were before. So southwest now continues to be known for its turn time, the amount of time it takes to come back in the gate, unload passen s and bags, you know, clean the plane, reload passengers and bags and take off. And that's part of southwest' sort of deep strategy. So that story got told not just for the substance that turn time is important, but for the relationship between n leaders and employees and who actually came up with the idea. And everyone at southwest knows that story, and it absolutely maps on to the culture that emphasizes both urgency and speed, but also a deep investment and mutual respect between employ s and leaders in the organization. Research
  Speaker 1
  reveals that the most powerful stories are about people living your values. Once you've identified your best culture stories, the second step is to reward and promote the protagonists in them, celebrate people who exemplify your values.
