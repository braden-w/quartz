## Highlights
- Effective Altruism Is Now Not Funding Constraint
  Summary:
  The Sali effect of altruism is now not funding constrain. There certainly is a lot more funding than there was before. But i think saying it's not funding candstrainating people to go too far in that. And i think, to some extent, that's a symptom of not thinking hard enough about great ways to spend money.

  Speaker 2
  Let me ask you a few questions about effective altruism, a movement where you've been a leader and madjor supporter, thanks to people like you, and also open philosophy. Effective altruism seems to be moving away from being funding constrained to now being talent constrained, or people or organization constrained. A, is that true? And b, if it's true, what does that mean for strategy?
  Speaker 1
  Yes, i think it's sort of true, but i think it's true al lest than most people think it's true. That is the mebran like that is what most people say. Sali effect of altruism is now not funding constrain. Because of myself, because of dust and ospits with open philanthropy and and a few other things, that's been a pretty big opdit. There certainly is a lot more funding than there was before. But i think saying it's not funding candstrainating people to go too far in that. And i think, to some extent, that's a symptom of not thinking hard enough about great ways to spend money. I think that, like, there needs to be more innovation an ways to spend money, before there can be city to spend the amount of money that effectaltriis going to have. But i also think that, like, that innovation is happening, and it will happen. And so i just think that, like, there is billions a year that i can see spent extremely effectively, is that's one thing i'll say. But yno, to the extent that it is funding constrained, and it certainly is more so now than it was before, the biggest thing that's missing is, i think, a weird thing. If it's not funding and strand then it hast to be something else constraint, right? Like, that's right. Takes ha question of, like, what is r the limiting factor on growth of the movement? And i think people say, like people. But, ok, you can talk to a lot afbout effective altras who aren't sure what they should do with their life. Which i think makes you wonder what people means ([TimeÂ 0:12:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/272dcf03-97a5-4f53-b0a5-29fa4a65235b))
