## Highlights
- The Evolution of the Human Eye Puzzled Darwin
  Summary:
  Darwin knew very early on that none of the ideas that anybody had ever offered gave him a sense of understanding how evolution could have worked. He spent a lot of time working on this idea and coming, you know, reading about things that gave him hints but not knowing why. After he figured it out, he had nightmares about it. And so he didn't publish for a long time, in part because he was scared of his own ideas.

  Well,
  Speaker 1
  obvious and not obvious at the same time. A, and i think about darwin in this context too, because darwin knew very early on that none of the ideas that anybody had ever offered gave him a sense of understanding how evolution could have worked. But he wanted to figure out how it could have worked. That was his goal. And he spent a lot of time working on this idea and coming, you know, reading about things that gave him hints and thinking they were interesting, but not knowing why, and drawing more and more pictures of different birds that differ slightly from each other, and so on, you know. And then then he figured it out. But after he figured it out, he had nightmares about it. He would dream about the complexity of the eye and the arguments that people had given about how ridiculous it was to imagine that that could have ever emerged from some sort of, you know, unguided process, that it hadn't been the product of design and, and so he didn't publish for a long time, in part because he was scared of his own ([Time 0:11:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/41fe088a-73a3-4663-9c66-3d794a89d214))
- The Leap of Intelligence in One Language Gene Mutation
  Summary:
  Wittogeti: It seems one heck of a leap you ap to get to this level of intelligence. He argues that language is the special thing that separates us from all other animals. Wittogeti, it's a lot like da decarts. Get an idea right? Exactly it.

  a lot like da decarts. Get a idea right? Exactly it. But it just seems that,
  Speaker 2
  it seems one heck of a leap you ap to get to this level of intelligence. Ye.
  Speaker 1
  And, you know, so chopsky a argued a that, you know, some a genetic fluke occurred a hundred thousand years and do you know just happened? That some human, some hominin predecessor of current humans, had this one gene tweak, but resulted in language. And language then provided this special thing that separates us from all other animals.

- Semantic Dimentia
  Summary:
  The disorder is something my colleagues and collaborators have chosen to call a semantic dimentia. And its progressive in the sense that the patient, a, loses the ability to appreciate the meaning of their experiences. They i hear sounds, but i don't know what they mean, kind of thing,. So as this illness progresses, it starts with the patient being unable toa differentiate like, similar breeds of dogs.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  i had begun to get interested in this nerological condition that might have been the very one that he was sccumbing to, as my own efforts to understand another aspect of this mystery that we have been discussing, while he was beginning to get progressively more and more affected. So i'm going to talk about the disorder and not about rummelhart for a second occasion. The disorder is something my colleagues and collaborators have chosen to call a semantic dimentia. So it's a specific form of loss of mind related to meaning, sematic dimentia. And its progressive in the sense that the patient, a, loses the ability to appreciate the meaning of the experiences that they have, either from touch, from sight, from sound, from language. They i hear sounds, but i don't know what they mean, kind of thing, a the so as as this illness progresses, it starts with the patient being unable toa differentiate like, similar breeds ([Time 1:03:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e39e1677-d6fa-46a8-b812-a5e55479f645))
- What Is Mathematics?
  Summary:
  Mathematics is a set of tools for exploring idealized worlds that often turn out to be extremely relevant to the real world. They are worlds in which objects exist with idealized properties, and in which the relationships among them can be characterized with precision so as to allow you to derive other facts with certainty. So, i think of mathematics as a Set of Tools For Exploring Idealized Worlds.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Well, i think of mathematics as a a set of tools for exploring idealized worlds that um often turn out to be extremely relevant to the real world, but need not a but they are worlds in which objects exist with idealized properties, and in which the relationships among them can be characterized with precision so as to allow the implications of certain facts to then allow you to derive other facts with certainty.

- Mathematical Idealized Objects
  Summary:
  "We built bridges out of triangles. And a, we understand how to measure the height of something we can't climb by," he says. "It's not a matter of formulas."
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  certain facts to then allow you to derive other facts with certainty. So, you know, if a, you have two triangles, and you know that there is aa, an angle in the first one that has the same measure as an angle in the second one, and you know that the length of the sides adjacent to that angle in each of the two triangles, a, the corresponding sides adjacent to that angle are also have the same measure, then you can then conclude that the triangles are congruent, that is to say, they have all their properties in common. And and that is something about triangles. It's not a matter of formulas. These are idealized objects. In fact, you know, we built bridges out of triangles. And a, we understand how to measure the height of something we can't climb by ([Time 1:32:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6cf0920d-a794-4ed4-9a22-d7885270c5c0))
- Idealized Objects Give Us Leverage
  Summary:
  The ability to get a tiny speck of matter launched from the planet earth to intersect with some tiny, tiny little body way out and way beyond pluto is something that's based on these ideas. So, but, and it's actually a happening in the real physical world that these ideas make contact with it in those kinds of instances.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  you know, all of the ability to a, get a tiny speck of matter launched from the planet earth to intersect with some tiny, tiny little body way out and way beyond pluto, somewhere that exactly a predicted time and date is is something that ands on these ideas, right? So, but, and it's actually a happening in the real physical world that these ideas make contact with it in those kinds of instances. A and a. So. But, you know, there are these idealized object these triangles, or these distances, or these points, whatever they are, that a, allow for this, a set of tools to be created that then gives human beings the this incredible leverage that they didn't have without these concepts. And a, i think this is actually already true when we think about ([Time 1:34:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/558f5b4e-f634-46fe-b0ad-8a9e674f6300))
- The Intuitive Connectionist Resources
  Summary:
  The insight that human mathematicians have had is a combination of the intuitive, kind of connection s like knowledge. It then ultimately becomes a part of the intuition that the next generation of mathematical thinkers have to ground their own thinking on. I came across this quotation from enri poincare while i was walking in the in the woods with my wife in northern californiaa late last summer. And what it said on the bench was, it is by logic that we prove, by intuition that we discover. That sort of represents the potential of capturing this, the intuitive side of this.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  It's just just thak, we're talking wichomski in language. It's the thing we've invented for the communication of those ideas that are not necessarily the deep representation of those ideas. Yes. So what a what's the what's a good way to model such powerful mathematical reasoning? Would you say, what are some ideas you have for capturing this in a model? The
  Speaker 1
  insight that human mathematicians have had is a combination of the kind of, the intuitive, kind of connection s like knowledge that makes it so that something is just like, obviously true, so that you don't have to think about why it's true. That then makes it possible to then take the next step and ponder and reason and figure out something that you previously didn't have that intuition about. It then ultimately becomes a part of the intuition that the next generation of mathematical thinkers have to ground their own thinking on, so that they can extend the ideas even further. I came across this quotation from enri poincare while i was walking in the in the woods with my wife in a state park in northern californiaa late last summer. And what it said on the bench was, it is by logic that we prove, by intuition that we discover. And so what what for me, the essence of the of the project is to understand how to bring the intuitive connectionist resources to bear on letting the intuitive discovery arise, you know, from engagement in thinking with this formal system. So i think of, you know, the ability of somebody like hinton or newton, or einstein, or romelhart, or picera, to a archimedes, another example, writes, suddenly a flash of insight occurs. It's, it's like the constellation of all o these simultaneous constraints that somehow or other causes the mind to settle into a novel state that it never did before, and and give rise to a new idea a that, you know, then you can say, ok, well, now, how can i prove this? You know, how do i write down the steps of that theorem that that allow me to make it rigorous and certain? And so i feel like the the kinds of things that we're beginning to see deep learning systems do of their own accord kind of gives me this feeling of, of, am, i don't know, hope or encouragement that ultimately, um, it'll all happen. Am, so in particular, as a many people now, have have become really interested in thinking about, you know, noral networks that have been trained with massive amounts of text can be given a prompt, and they can then sort of generate some really interesting, fanciful, creative story from that prompt. A and ah, there's, there's kind of like a sense that they've somehow synthesized something like a novel out of the, you know, all f the particulars of all the billions and billions of experiences that went into the training data, that it gives rise to something like this sort of intuitive sense of what would be a, a fun and interesting little story to tell, or something like that. It just sort of wells up out of the, out of the letting the thing play out its own imagining of what somebody might say given this prompt, as as impot to get itto to start to generate its own thoughts and and to me, that that sort of represents the potential of capturing this, the intuitive side of this.

- The Difference Between Language and Mathematical Cognition
  Summary:
  Is it unfair to draw between mathematical cognition and language, linguistic cognition? I think that's a very interesting question, and i'm actually very interested in right now. Would you say it's more fundamental than, like, language? If we start dancing, if we bring chamsky back into the conversation, first of all, is it unfair to Draw That Line? We're going to see some of the subtleties and interesting aspects of the difference.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Would you say it's more fundamental than, like, language? If we start dancing, if we bring chamsky back into the conversation, first of all, is it unfair to draw between mathematical cognition and language, linguistic
  Speaker 1
  cognition. I think that's a very interesting question, and i think it's one of the ones that i'm actually very interested in right now. A, but i i think the answer is, in important ways, it is important draw that line, but then to come back and look at it again and see some of the subtleties and interesting aspects of the difference. A, so if we think about chomsky himself, um, he e was born into an academic family. His father was a professor of rabinical studies at a small rabbinical college in philadelphia. A, and he was deeply inculturated in a, you know, a culture of thought and reason, and brought to the effort to understand natural language this profound engagement with these formal systems. And a, you know, i think that there was tremendous power in that, and that chamsky had some azing insight into the structure of natural language. But that use the word but there, the actual intuitive knowledge of these things only goes so far, and does not go as far as it does in people like thomsky himself. And this was something that was discovered in the phd. Dissertation of lila glightman, who was actually trained in the same linguistic department with chomsky. So what lila discovered was that the intuitions that linguists had about even the meaning of a phrase, not just about its but about what they thought a phrase must mean, were very different from the intuitions of an ordinary person who wasn't a formally trained thinker. And well, it recently has become much more salient. I happened to have learned about this when i myself was a ph d. Student at the university of pennsylvania, but im i never knew how to put it together with all my other thinking about these things. So so i actually currently have the hypothesis that formerly trained linguists and other formally trained a academics, whether it be linguistics, philosophy, cognitive science, computer s, machine learning, mathematics, a have a mot if engagement with experience that is intuitively, deeply structured to be more organized around a the systematicity, a and a ability to be conformant with the principles of a system than a than is actually true of the natural human ([Time 1:48:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fd70617a-7d16-4f01-91f5-ffcda7d8ef2f))
- The Expert Blind Spot Is More Prosaic
  Summary:
  The different fields and approaches with which you start to study the mind actually take you away from the natural operation of the mind. So it makes it very difficult for you to to be somebody who introspects, yes. And this is where am a things about human belief and so called knowledge a that we consider am private, not our business to manipulate.

  Speaker 1
  And you know, this is where am a things about human belief and so called knowledge a that we consider am private, not our business to manipulate. In others, we are not entitled to tell somebody else what to believe about certain kinds of things. Am, what are those beliefsl they are the product of this sort of immersion, an iculturation. That is what i believe. So,
  Speaker 2
  and that's limiting.
  Speaker 1
  It's,
  Speaker 2
  it's something to be aware of. Does i limit you from having a good model of some of cognition? An, so when you look at mathematical o, r, linguisticsm what? What is that line then? What? A? So chamsky unable to sneak up to the full picture of cognition? Are you? When you're focusing a mathematicala, thinking, are you also unable to do so?
  Speaker 1
  I think, you you're right. I think that's a great way of characterizing it. And am think that it's related to the concept of beginner's minda. And am another concept called the expert blind spot. So the expert blind spot is much more prosaic seeming, tha than this point that you were just ([Time 1:53:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/03fa38c8-730b-4bdd-b409-6c112e0389e9))
- Are the Natural Numbers Really the Work of Man?
  Summary:
  The natural numbers were considered to be a part of the innate endowment of, you know, core knowledge. It turns out that many cognitive scientists agreed with him for a time. And it's actually been more or less accepted by almost everyone that the natural numbers are actually a cultural construction.

  making. But it's, it's something plagues experts when they try to communicate their understanding to non experts, and that is that things are self evident to them that they, they can't begin to even think about how they could explain it to somebody else, because it is like, well, it's just, like, so patently obvious that it must be true. An am, you know, like am, when kronaker said, god made the natural numbers, all else is the work of man, he was expressing that, that intuition that am somehow or other, you know, the basic fundamentals of discreet quantities being countable and innumerable and, you know, indefinite in number, am was, was not something that had to be discovered. A, but he was wrong. It turns out that many cognitive scientists agreed with him for a time. There was a long period of time where ther were, where, a, you know, the natural numbers were considered to be a part of the innate endowment of, you know, core knowledge. Or, you know, to use thekind of phrases that spelkian and carey use to talk about what they believe are the innate primitives of the human mind. And they no longer believe that they, it's actually a been more or less accepted by almost everyone that the natural numbers are actually a cultural construction. And it's, it's so interesting to go back in, so, like study those few people who still exist who, you know, don't have those systems. So, so this is just an example to me. And where, you know, a certain mode of thinking about language itself, or a certain mode of thinking about geometry and those kinds of relations so become so second nature that you don't know what it is that you need to teach and, um. And in fact, we don't really teach it all that explicitly anyway. It's, it's, you know, you take a math class, the professor sort of teaches it to you the way they understand it. Some of the students in the class sort of like, you know, they get it. They start to get the of thinking, and they can actually do the problems that get put on the home work that the professor thinks are interesting and challenging ones. But, but, but most of the students who don't kind of engage as deeply, don't ever get, you know. And we we think, oh, that man must be brilliant, he must have special insight, but i, you know, he must have some, you know, biological sort of bit that's different, right, that makes him so that he or she could have that insight. But i, i'm, although i don't want to dismiss biological individual differences completely, i i find it much more interesting to think about the possibility that, um, you know, it was that difference in the dinner, a conversation at the chomsky house when he was growing up, that made it so that he had that cast of mind.

- What Advice Would You Give to Young People?
  Summary:
  When he was in college, David Frum thought he wanted to be a psychiatrist. He ended up studying psychology and went on to graduate school. His professors nominated him for the magna suma despite his poor grades. "Finding the thing that you are intrinsically motivated to engage with is what it's all about"
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So
  Speaker 2
  let me ask you big, ah question of advice. So you've lived an incredible life in terms of the ideas you've put out into the world, in terms of the trajecto you've taken through your career, through your life, what advice would you give to young people to day in high school and college about a how to have a career, or how to have a life they can be proud of? Finding
  Speaker 1
  the thing that you are intrinsically motivated to engage with, and then celebrating that discovery is is what, ah, what it's all aboutwewhen when i was in college, i struggled with that, i i am, i had thought i wanted to be a psychiatrist, because i think i was interested in human psychology and high school, and at that time, the only sort of information i had that had anything to do with the psyche was, you know, freud and eric from and sort of popular psychiatry kinds of things. And so, well, they were psyc atrist, right? So i had to be a psychiatrist. Anda that meant i had to go to medical school. And i got to college, and i find myself taking, you know, the first semester of a three quarter physics class, and it was mechanics. And this was so far from what it was i was interested in, but it was also too early in the morning, in the winter quart somester. So i never made it of the physics class. But i wandered about the rest of my freshman year and most of my sophomore year until, a, i found myself in the midst of this situation where around me, m there was this big revolution happening. I was at columbia university in 19 68, and the via um war is going on. Columbia is building a gim in morningside heights, which is part of harlem. And people are thinking, oh, the big bad rich guys are stealing the the the park land that belong to the people of harlem. And a, you know, they're part of the military industrial complex, which is enslaving us and sending us all off to war in vianom. And so there is a big revolution that a confluence of black activism and, you know, s t s and social justice, and the whole university blew up and got shut down. And a, i got a chance to sort of think about why people were behaving the way they were in this context. And i, you know, i happened to have taken mathematical statistics. I happened to have been takin psychology that quarter, ad just sike one and somehow things in that space all ran together in my mind and got me really excited about about asking questions about why people, what made certain people go into the buildings and not others, and things like that. And so suddenly i had a path forward. And i had just been wandering around aimlessly and athe different points my career, you know, when i think, ok, well, should i take this class? Or should i just read that book about some idea that i want to understand better, you know? Or should i, should i pursue the thing that excites me and interests me, or should i, you know, meet somereu ment? You know, that's i always did the latter. So i ended up, my, my professors in psychology were thought i was great. They wanted me to go to graduate school. They deynominated me for fibeta capa. And i went to the fibeta cap inhe ceremony, and the sky came up, noly said, oh, you magna suma. I wasn't even getting on based on my grades. They just happened to have thought i was interested enough in ideas to belonged to fibit. ([Time 2:03:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2b6564d9-595c-4e33-82bf-26d2848ee2bb))
- The Mozart Effect
  Summary:
  i really consider to be the mozart effect. It's sort of the energy of something with, with experience that then results in a unique flowering of a particular mind. People can be excited about fitting people on bicycles as well as excited about making their old networks achief insights into human cognitionlike for me, personally, i've always been excited about love and friendship between humans. I don't know how useful that is for anything, but there'se's the sort of what i've talt you exactly.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Ye
  Speaker 2
  ths, those are the two things, is like, be attentive enough to to feel it when it comes like this is something me, i don't know. Ah, for example, i really like a tabular data like excel sheets, like it brings me deep joy. I don't know how useful that is for anything, but there'se's the sort
  Speaker 1
  of what i've talt you
  Speaker 2
  exactly. So there's like a million, not million, but there's a lot of things like that for me. And you have to hear that for yourself, like be li, realizeh this his really joyful. But then the other part that you are mentioning, which is the nurture, is take timed, stay with it. Stay with it awhile, and and see where that takes youa in life. I think, i think the a, the
  Speaker 1
  the motivational engagement, results in the immersion that then creates the opportunity to obtain the expert so ewe can call itte the mozart effect, right? I mean, when i think about mozart, i think about, you know, the person who was born as the fourth member of the family string quartet, right? And a, and they handed him the violinad he was six queeks a, all right, start playing, you know, it like an a. So the level of immersion there was amazingly profound. But hopefully he also had, you know, some something. Maybe this is where the more sor of the genetic part comes in. Sometimes i think a, you know, something in him resignated to the music so that that the inergy of combination of that was so powerful. So, so that's what i really consider to be the mozart effect. It's sort of the energy of something with, with experience thatat then results in the unique flowering of a particular, you know, mind. A, so, i know, my siblings and i are all very different from each other. We've all in our own different directions. And, you know, i mentioned my younger brother, who was very musical. I had my other younger brother was like this amazing, like, intuitive engineer. A and a, my sist, one of my sisters, was passionate about and, you know, water conservation, well before it was a, you know, such a hugely important issue that it is to day. So we all sort of, somehow the find a different thing, um. And i i don't mean to say it isn't tied in with something about about us biologically, ut but it's also when that happens, where you can find that then, you know, you can do your thing, and you can be excited about it. People can be excited about fitting people on bicycles as well as excited about making their old networks achief insights into human cognitionlike
  Speaker 2
  for me, personally, i've always been excited about love and friendship between humans. ([Time 2:10:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/146f71a5-d845-4599-bebf-1ad61aab8604))
