  And can hov who is in charge during those critical moments for tm,
  Speaker 2
  ye, ont one theme of the book is kind of challenging the idea that there's been this inevitable convergence on kind of the more like, the better modern values that we have to day, thatthat things kind of had to be like as we got richer and more educated, that we had to converge on the valleys that we have. Now, you kind of argued that things could have gone off in many different directions. L, i think tat, there's one thing you larn from studying history, is that people can believe all kinds different crazy, crazy t well, crazy egs, fror mi, what af you i just like absolutl outrageously different cosmologies. Yes. I mean, so
  Speaker 1
  historians in general tend to emphasize this idea of contingency, where, ye, when i say that something is contingent, i just mean that, i don't mean it was like an accident that it happened. I just mean that could have plausibly gone a different way. And so an example of contingency, and what i would call bad lock in, that i like to use is the song happy birthday. So the melody for happy birthday is really atrocious. It's like a dirge. ([Time 0:13:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/97573bee-cae5-434e-b085-0d4408d70887))
- Happy Birthday Song as a Contingency
  Summary:
  Historians tend to emphasize this idea of contingency, where something is contingent. And so an example of contingency, and what i would call bad lock in, that i like to use is the song happy birthday. So the melody for happy birthday is really atrocious. It's like a dirge. No one can sing it. But we're stuck with it, yes. Happen to us all, exactly.

  historians in general tend to emphasize this idea of contingency, where, ye, when i say that something is contingent, i just mean that, i don't mean it was like an accident that it happened. I just mean that could have plausibly gone a different way. And so an example of contingency, and what i would call bad lock in, that i like to use is the song happy birthday. So the melody for happy birthday is really atrocious. It's like a dirge. It has just, like, really large interval, happy birthday, like, no one can sing it. I can sing it. And so rearely, if you were going to pick, you know, a tune to be the most wid t to be the most widely sung a song, well, i really wouldn't be that tune yet. It's the one that took off, and it's now, you know, in almost all, like, major languages, that's the tune you sing for hap y birthday. Is there an explanation for that? Im, i
  Speaker 2
  think it's just, like, chance and circumstance. Happen to us all,
  Speaker 1
  exactly. Ye. You'l get one piece of music that becomes the standard, and then, like, you know, other people cofinde co the eight a different, hapvy birthday song. But it won't, you know, it won't take onas, ye, not done. And obviously, this is, like, why does it persist while because it jus not that biga deal, ye. But i think it's a kind of illustration of the fact that you can get something that is quite contingent. It could have been otherwise. Happy birthday could have had one of many different tunes, could have been better. We'ud all be slightly happier, bu yo er singing a different happy birthday tune. A, but we're stock, ye. But we're stuck with it, yes. And then there's other ([Time 0:14:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/baf4778a-0821-4bd9-9a36-aee06b54136e))
- Moral Contingency
  Summary:
  Most of the world's vegetarians are then in india, where something like a third of the population or vegetarian. Why is that? Well, it's clearly just because of a religious tadition. Im ly why moslems or jews tend to not eat pork. And there's clear variation in people's diet, and that really makes a moral difference. It rerely shows the power of d culture, ye culture and values, where people can just have yet another view on things.

  Whereas
  Speaker 1
  ore ther moral values, i think we can say they nearly do seem contingent. So, and it's perhaps quite uncontroversial. So attitude to diet, for example. So most of the world's vegetarians arethen in india, where something like a third of the population or vegetarian. Why is that? Well, it's clearly just because of a religious tadition. Im ly why moslems or jews tend to not eat pork. Again, we can just point to the religious tadition. And there's clear variation in people's diet, and that really makes a moral difference. Well, so that's i think, a very clear case of moral contingency.
  Speaker 2
  Yes, omthing. So, i've been on this thick learning about theology and old, old religion the last six months. One of my just favorite crazy facts about history of religion ists. O so, the janes have ben round for ry long time. This, like indian religions, yes, to some extent, sort of a precursor to buddhism. So i think, like, around four thousand b c, they already have this concern that you couldn't eat particular kind of root vegetables, because if they tended to attract insects on to them. And so if you like, pulled this carrots out of the ground and then ate them, you'd be harming the insects that are, that are on on these likeegebles. So they have like, particular resets, why they have particular dietary restrictions, like, not only you have to be vegetarian, but you can't eat, like, plants that at too many insects to them. It is like, imagine being a subsistence farmer, yer in, like, in a rural india, four thousand b c, as i presumeably no education. But like, this strikes you as a really important thing. It's like insect well being, and you're wiling tomake like material

  sacrifices. It rerely shows the power of d culture, ye culture and values, where people can just have ([Time 0:16:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e48abe1d-5aca-43d6-960e-6f23964f5c2d))
- Be Ambitious Because of the Fat Tailed Distribution
  Summary:
  The unofficial theme for this particular conference is a culture of ambition. If you are altruistic, should you try and be very ambitious or have ambitious plans? And i think there's a few reasons for that. One is kind of more theoretical. So if you just aim to do kind of a typical amount of good, then you're going to do much less good in expectation. Then if you're like, really aiming for the best,. The best outcomes are just way, way better than the, you know, just kind of typical outcomes.

  Speaker 2
  yet. No, it is actually incrediblethat the sh number of people and the calibre of the people at these events. I me away the last one. Nd, just ly constantly blown away. But anyway, yo, the unofficial theme for for this particular conference is a culture of ambition. And i know you hae, awhole. Lot of hollow thoughts on that topic, and i thin you're giving a keynote about that, not giving the opening. Tolk, opening talk. Ye, se, how d you think people who were serious about improving, improving the world in a kind of effective altruism might set away? How how shoud attitude and approach poetentially have shifted over the last couple of years? Yes,
  Speaker 1
  well, so, yes, this theme is a culture of ambition. And you know why? If you are altruistic, should you try and be very ambitious or have ambitious plans? And i think there's a few reasons for that. So one is kind of more theoretical. So if you think the distribution of impact is a fat tailed distribution, that means that your, the mean impact is bigger than the medium. So if you just aim to do kind of a typical amount of good, then you're going to do much less good in expectation. And, ah, i think plausibly, it's like the expected value of the good that you do that matters. Then if you're like, really aiming for the best. And that's because, in the nature of the distribution, the best outcomes are just way, way better than the, you know, just kind of typical outcomes. And so there's, again, this, you know, theoretical case, and we've seen that in practice as well. ([Time 1:00:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1f70b73f-0b6f-4f1f-96d7-8c2bcf0338b6))
