## Highlights
- What Makes Chess So Compelling?
  Summary:
  The dynamic ness of the different kind of chest positions you can have whether they're closed or open. And other things comes from the bishop and the knights. So i don't see to learn why to doa with alfagoye with alfago and af zero mu zero and then gat, all the things that well, get into some parts of chess. But let's just sthick on chest ly a on the human side of chess.

  with alfago and af zero mu zero and then gat, all the things that well, get into some parts of there's just a fascinating trajectory here. But let's just sthick on chest ly a on the human side of chess. You've proposed that from a game designed perspective, the thing that makes chess compelling is a game, ah, is that there's a creative tension between a bishop and the knight. Can you explain this for isal? It's really interesting to think about makes a game compelling at makes a stick across centuries?
  Speaker 1
  Yes, i was sort of thinking about this, and naturally, a lot of even amazing chess players, don't think about it, necessarily, from a game's designer point of view. So asto with my game design hat on that i was thinking about this, why is chess so compelling? And i think a critical er reason is that the dynamic ness of of the different kind of chest positions you can have whether they're closed or open. And other things comes from the bishop and the knights. If you think about how different that t tha, the capabilities of the bishop and knight are in terms of the way they move. And then somehow chess has evolved to balance those capabilities, more or less equally. So they're both roughly worth three points each. So you think their dynamics was always there, and then the rest of the rules are kind of trying to stabilize the gig. Well maybe. I mean, it's sort of idonas chicken and egg situation, probably both came together. But the fact that it's got to this beautiful equilibrium ([Time 0:28:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f4d27313-d52a-4174-8f5f-1646259ca2d4))

But the fact that it's got to this beautiful equilibrium where you can have the bishop and night, the different in power, a bucks, so equal in value across the set of the universe of all positions, right? Somehow they've been balanced by humanity over hundreds of years, a i think, gives gives the game the creative tension that you can swap the bishop and nightsfor a bishop for a night, and o there, more or less worth the same, but now you aim for a different type of position. If you have the night, you want a closed position. F you have the bishop, you want an open position. ([Time 0:29:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ddfb7552-3734-474a-a2a3-8fd88a059036))
- The Biggest Miracle of the Universe
  Summary:
  Our brains are the most complex ts in that we know of in the universe. And i think it's amazing that with our human minds we're able to build things like computers and investigate about these questions. Yes, the universe built the human mind that now is building computers that help us understand both the universe and our own human mind - right? Its lictly it. I mean, one could say, we, we all, maybe we're the mechanism by which the universe is going to try and understand itself. Ah, it's beautiful.

  Speaker 2
  Well,
  Speaker 1
  look, i think it's em you say it's a few, you know, of course it's this is, i think it the biggest miracle of the universe, is thet er. It is just a few pounds of mush in our skulls, and yet it's also our brains are the most complex ts in that we know of in the universe. So there's something profoundly beautiful and amazing about our brains. And i think that it's an incredibly, incredible, efficient machine. And an and its is, you know, phenomenon, basically. And i think that bil in a i, one of the reasons i want to build a i, and i've always wanted to, is i think by building an intelligent artir fact, like a i, and then comparing it to the human mind, a, that will help us unlock the uniqueness and true secrets of the mind that we've always wandered about since the dawn of history, like consciousness, dreaming, a creativity, a a emotions. What are all these things? Rightwi, wi, we've wondered about them since since the dawn of humanity. And i think one of the reasons, and you know, i love philosophy, and philosophy of mind, is we've found, i difficulties. There haven't been the tools for us to really, other than introspection, two fromvery clever people in history, very clever philosophers, to really investigate this scientifically. But now, suddenly we have a pelethro of tools. First, we have all the newer science tools, from u machine, single cell recording, all this stuff. But we also have the ability, computers and a i, to build or intelligence systems. So i think that er, you know, i think it is amazing what the human mind does. And er, and, and i'm kind of in awe of it, really. And er, and i think it's amazing that with our human minds we're able to build things like computers and and a even you now think and investigate about these questions. I think that's also testament the human mind.
  Speaker 3
  Yes, the universe built the
  Speaker 2
  human mind that now is building computers that help us understand both the universe and our own human mind, right? Its
  Speaker 1
  lictly it. I mean, i think that's one we, one could say, we, we all, maybe we're the mechanism by which the universe is going to try and understand itself. Yes.
  Speaker 2
  Ah, it's beautiful. So let's, let's go to the basic building blocks of biology. ([Time 0:41:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c7ae5309-c753-40b0-ae70-8371b384ba44))
- Proteins Fold Up in a Matter of Miller Seconds
  Summary:
  Proteins themselves, i think, are magical and incredible. The average protein can fold in maybe ten to the power 300 different confirmations. In some cases there might be a misfunction so on, which leads to a lot of the disorders and stuff like that. it's a weird system that they've figured it out.

  Speaker 2
  functions. And it's a weird
  Speaker 1
  system that they've figured it out. Well, for sure. I mean, you know, maybe we should talk about the origins of life too. But proteins themselves, i think, are magical and incredible. A a, as i said, little little bionana machines and ar and, and actually, leventa, who is another scientist, a contemporary of amvinson a, he, he coined this, leventa, what became known as leventa's paradox, which is exactly what you're saying. He calculated roughly a prot an, average protein, which is maybe two thousand amino acids, a bases long. Is a is is can fold in maybe ten to the power 300 different confirmations. So thes ten to the power 300 different ways that protein could fold up. And yet, somehow, in nature, physics solves this, solves this in a matter of miller seconds. So proteins fold up in your body in, you know, sometimes in in fractions of a second. Sophysics is somehow solving that search problem. And
  Speaker 2
  just to be clear, in many of these cases may be correctny fom wrong. There's often a unique way for the sequence to form itself, yes. So among that huge number of possibilities, yes, it figures out a way how to stable a in some cases there might be a misfunction so on, which leads to a lot of the disorders and stuff like that. But yes, most of the time it's a unique mapping. And that unique mapping is not obvious.
  Speaker 1
  No, exactly. I shoul see what the problem is, exactly. So there's a unique mapping, usually in healthy if it's healthy. And as you say, in as so, for example, outsimers one one, one conjecture is that it's because of a misfolder protein, a protein that falls in the wrong way.

- Is There a Responsibility to Build Systems That Are Not Sensient?
  Summary:
  Google engineer said language model exhibited sentiente so you believed there might be a responsibility to build systems that are not sentient. So what's your thought about this particular a system? Wi isa, have you ever met a language thats sentient? No, i practily kno. Now, what do you make of the case when you can feel that there are some element of sentience to the system? Yes, an interesting question, and alse a very fundamental one. I think at the moment, it's more f projection of the way our own minds work which is to see a a sort of purpose and direction in almost anything that we in our brains are trained to interpret.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  So on that topic, just not as the sea of deep mind im just as a human being. When may ask you about this one particular anecdotal evidence of the google engineer who made a comment or a believed that there is some aspect of a language model, on the lambde language model, that exhibited sentiente so you said you believed there might be a responsibility to build systems that are not sentient. And this experience of a particular engineer, i think, i'd love to get you nal opinion on this kind of thing, but i think it will happen more and more and more, which a, not when engineers, but when when people out there that don't have an engineer background start interacting with increasingly intelligent systems. We anthropomorphise them, they they start to have deep impactfu a inter tions with us in a way that we miss them when they're gone. And we sure feel like there living entities, self aware entities, and maybe when we project sentience onto them. So what's your thought about this particular a system? Wi isa, have you ever met a language thats sentient? No, i practily kno. Now, what do you make of the case when you can feel that there are some element of sentience to the system?
  Speaker 1
  Yes, so this is, you know, an interesting question, and alse a very fundamental one. So the first thing to say is, i think that, er, none of the systems we have to day, i would say, even have one iota of a semblance of consciousness or sentimence. That's my personal feeling interacting with them every day. I think this way premature to be discussing what the engineer talked about, i preach. I think at the moment, it's more f projection of the way our own minds work, which is to see a a sort of purpose and direction in almost anything that we in our brains are trained to interpret, a a agency, basically, in things are even ann inanimate thing sometimes.
