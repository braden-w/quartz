## Highlights
- The Dilemma of Russian History
  Summary:
  Russia is smaller now compared to one stalen was in that kremlin. Russia has got pushed back to borders almost the time of peter the great. It's farther from main european capitals now than any time since eighteenth century. And it and the west has only grown stronger in that period of time. So the dilemma is greater than ever.

  Speaker 1
  So if he's not comparable to stalin, he still works, as i said, in those same buildings, those same offices, partly. And so therefore he's got some of the problems that stalin had, which was managing russian power in the world from a position of weakness, vizv the west, but from a an ambition, a granddiocity, in fact. And so this combination of weakness and grandeur, right, of not being as strong as he west, but aspiring to be as great or greater than the west. That's the dilemma of russian history for the past many centuries. It was the dilemma for the czars. It was the dilemma for peter the great. It was the dilemma for alexander. It was the dilemma for stalin, and it's the dilemma for puten. Russia is smaller now compared to one stalen was in that kremlin. It's got pushed back to borders almost the time of peter the great. It's farther from the main european capitals now than any time since that eighteenth century. And it and the west has only grown stronger in that period of time. So the dilemma is greater than ever. The irony of being in that position of sitting in the kremlin, trying to manage russian power in the world, trying to be a providential power, ([Time 0:12:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ecb62414-ef26-4185-b9d5-301f5278706b))
- Mao Put Bigger Numbers on the Board
  Summary:
  The most amazing about ma is he watched stalan do it. He watched stalin collectivize agriculture and famine result. The prima paja evidence is that he didn't value human life. And numbers matter here, if we compare these singular figures. Yet, ma killed more people than stalen because ma had more people to kill.

  And numbers matter here, if we compare these singular figures. Yet,
  Speaker 1
  ma killed more people than stalen because ma had more people to kill. The most amazing about ma is he watched stalan do it. He watched stalin collectivize agriculture and famine result. He watched stallan impose this communist monopoly, and all those people sent to prison or given a bullet in the back of the neck. He watched all of that, and then he did it again himself in china. Do you think he saw the human cast directly? That
  Speaker 2
  that when you say he saw, do you think he was focused on the policies, or was he also aware, distinctly, as a human being, of the human costs in the lives of peasants and in the lives of the working class and the lives of the poor? I
  Speaker 1
  think the prima paja evidence is that he didn't value human life. ([Time 0:18:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e3497a5c-0d7f-41a0-9005-16b91fe6b031))
- Never Mind That The Bush Administration Was Trying Desperately To Hold The Soviet Union Together
  Summary:
  The Russian foreign minister has been giving interviews s in the press. He's got this conspiratorial theory that the west has been on a forever campaign to destroy russia, just like it destroyed the soviet union. Everything the west does is meant to dismember russia, and that russia is fighting an existential battle against the west. Never mind that bill clinton's administration, following george bush, sent loads of money, western taxpayer money, to Russia. So how was that a plot? And lixs.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And patrushef has been giving interviews s in the press. You probably saw the interview with nisavisimaia gazieta not that long ago. He writes also his own blog, like interventions in the public sphere using the few channels that are left. And what's interesting about patrushefandand this could well reflect similar thinking to putens, which is why bringing this up, is that he's got this conspiratorial theory that the west has been on a forever campaign to destroy russia, just like it destroyed the soviet union, and that everything the west does is meant to dismember russia, and that russia is fighting an existential battle against the west. And so, for example, the c i a and american government wanted to bring down the soviet union. Never mind that the bush administration, the first bush, the father, was trying desperately to hold the soviet union together because they were afraid of the chaos that might ensue and the nooks that might get loose as a result of a soviet collapsed. And it wasn'ttill the very last moment where bush decided, his administration decided to back those republican leaders who were breaking away from mihail gorbichof and the soviet union. Right? So never mind the empirics of it. Never mind that bill clinton's administration, following george bush, sent loads of money, western taxpayer money, to russia. We don't know exactly how much, because it came from different sources. People talk about how there was no marthal plan. It was tens of billions of dollars from various sources, from the i m f and other sources. And lixs. It disappeared. It's gone. Just like the german money that went to gorbatrov for unification red even before the soviet collapse, the money disappeared, but the west sent the money. So how was that a plot?

- Response to Oliver Stone’s Russia had No Choice but to Invade due to NATO Pressure (Rape Analogy)
  Summary:
  Yellex: Russia is an autocratic, repressive regime that invades its neighbors in the name of its own security. Did we not see this before? Does this not pre date nato expansion? does this not predate the existence of nato? I mean, you don't have to go farther than that," he says.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  You disagree with this point, in terms of placing the blame somehow on the invasion, on of forces larger than the particular two nations involved, but a more on the geo politics of the world that is driven by the most powerful y nation in the world, which is the united states. Yelex,
  Speaker 1
  so let's imagine that a tragedy's happened here in new york, and a woman got raped. We know the perpetrator. They go to trial, and oliver stone gets up and says, you know what? The woman was wearing a short skirt, and there was no option but for rapesto rapeer. The woman was wearing lipstick, or the woman was applying for nato membership and just had to be raped thers. I mean, didn't want a raper, but was compelled because of what she was doing and what she looked like and and the clothes she was wearing, and the alliances that she was under. International law signed by moscow. All the treaties that sovereign countries get to choose whatever alliance they belong to, a treaties that the u. N charter, signed by russia, the soviet union, the 19 75 helsinki agreement, signed by the soviet union. The 19 90 charter of paris for new europe, signed by the soviet uion, the 19 97 nato russia founding act, signed by the russian government, the post soviet russia. All of those documents signed by either the soviet regime or the russian regime, which is the legally recognized, international, inheritor right successor of the soviet state. All those agreements are still in force, and all of them say that countries are sovereign and can freely choose their foreign policy and what alliances they want to join. Let's even go farther than that. I mean, you don't have to go farther than that. But let's go farther than that. Lex is an autocratic, repressive regime that invades its neighbors in the name of its own security. Something new in russian history. Did we not see this before? Is this? Does this not pre date nato expansion? Does this not predate the existence of nato? Would oliver stone sit here in this chair and say to you, you know, they had to impose serftom in the seventeenth century because nato expanded. They had no choice. Their hands were tied.

- Is There Any Illusions About Who Controls The World?
  Summary:
  China is trying to become one of the great powers in the world. They resent that the west doesn't acknowledge them as one of those great powers. It's very hard to have illusions about what world you live in when you're under western banks and high end technology, says Ceca Cevallos. "You can call them illusions, you can call them fantasies. Whatever you want to call them, they're real"
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  cletocracy. It's a belief. Ceca, it's passion, it's conviction, it's, it's, you can call them illusions, you can call them fantasies. Whatever you want to call them, they're real. They're real for those people. And so yes, they're loding that very state that they're trying to make one of the great powers in the world. And they resent the fact that the west doesn't acknowledge them as one of those great powers. And they resent that the west is more powerful. People talk about how poton doesn't understand the world, and that he gets really bad information. Lex, if you're sitting there in that kremlin and you're trying to conduct business in the world, and you're getting reports from your finance minister or your central bank governor your whole economy, everything that matters, somehow all your trade is denominated in dollars and uros, do you have any illusions about who controls the international financial system? I don't think so. Lex, you're looking over your industrial plan for the next year, and you're looking over how many tanks you're going to get, and how many cruis missiles you're going to get, and how many submarines you're going to get and and filling the blank. And you know what? Its right there in the paper work. Where the component parts come from, where the soft work comes from, comes from the west. Lex, your whole military industrial complex is dependent on high end western technology. And then, and let's, and let's say you're in bejing, not just in moscow, and you go to a meeting in your own neighborhood. You're the leader of china. You go to a meeting with other asian leaders. Do they all speak in chinese with you? No, lex, they don't speak chinese. You go to an international meeting as the leader of china, and guess what? Language is the main language of intercourse. Yes, the same one you and i are speaking right now. And so you live in that world. You live in the western world. And it's very hard to have illusions about what world you live in when you're under that you need those western banks. You need that foreign currency riht. You need that high end western technology, that technology transfer. ([Time 1:04:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6bda2847-59c6-40b0-8273-0ce82c0ce35d))

  Summary:
  He's spectacular. Puts his life on the line for the country of ukraine. A pretty big message, don't you think? And it's crucial. There's no room onzoom, let alone in person, that he can't win over. He's just so effective. You know, this is the first time reality t v has been about reality instead of fake reality t v,. which is just as completely fake nonsense.

And in a war, it's a t v production company and a t v personality, those that's exactly what you want running a country, because they're crushing in the information war. He's spectacular. European parliament, us. Congress, is rarely parliament. There's no room onzoom, let alone in person, that he can't win over. He's just so effective. You know, this is the first time reality t v has been about reality instead of fake reality t v, is just as completely fake nonsense. But zalensky, this is real reality t v. And he means it. And the nation is behind him, and they're just as courageous and just as ingenious in many ways. And it's spectacular. And so yes, who saw that coming? I didn't see that coming. Lex. In fact, the by didn't. Ea we talk about puton's miscalculation. The administration, as you alluded to, offered him an exit from the country. They didn't say, you know, you want to stand and fight, we'll back you. They said, we'll get you out, you want to come now. And famously, you know that quote, rit, what he said about how he doesn't need a ride? ([Time 1:18:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f74f0d8f-90a2-4fea-bd9f-4fdb79ba77d9))
- Western Hypocrisy
  Summary:
  The west invades countries when it wants, but when others do that, it's illegal. The west arrests you for money laundering, but it's western money laundering that is where you go when you need to launder money. So they see the hypocrisy. They see the excessive power that the west has, and they resent it. And they say, you who elected you to run the world? We have a billion plus people, or we have a 200 plus mill people, and we don't have a say. You'rethe one in charge.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And those things are true simultaneously. And that's the world we live in, meaning that not western countries envy and admire the west, but they also resent the power of the west. Western hypocrisy riht. The west invades countries when it wants, but when others do that, it's illegal, right? The west arrests you for money laundering, but it's western money laundering that is where you go when you need to launder money, right? So they see the hypocrisy. They see the excessive power that the west has, and they resent it. And they say, you who elected you to run the world? We have a billion plus people, or we have a 200 plus mill people, and we don't have a say. ([Time 1:29:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0c456a45-6a22-4ed8-ba79-507c4bb171bb))
- Are You Worried About Nuclear War?
  Summary:
  "You could well have europe signing on tonado, direct engagement both washington, o boy and brussels," he says. "He's potentially provoking a direct clash with natos military, not just with the ucranian military." If you're sitting in the kremlan looking at those charts, lex, of nato capabilities, 'you can't conquer' that kind of power,' writes Puttman.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  You could well have
  Speaker 1
  europe signing on tonado, direct engagement both washington, o boy and brussels, direct engagement of the russian army on the territory of ukraine.
  Speaker 2
  You think that's possible to do that without dramatic escullation from the russian side?
  Speaker 1
  Yes, i do think it's possible, but it's very worrisome, just like you're saying. But, but if putton were to escalate like that, he's firing that weapon at himself, and he's potentially provoking a direct clash with natos military, not just with the ucranian military. If you're sitting in the kremlan looking at those charts, lex, of nato capabilities, you can't conquer, you krane, which didn't really have heavy weapons before february 20 22, at scale. And you're thinking, ok, now i'm going to take on nato. That would be a bold step on the part of a russian leader. And let's also remember, lex, that there's another variable here. You're a despot as long as everyone implements your orders. And so if people start to say, quietly, not necessarily publicly, i may not implement that orders, that's maybe a criminal order. Or my grandma is ucranian, or my wife is ucranian, or i don't want to go to the hog. ([Time 1:52:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f340c3c5-c622-42de-9c80-cd4d8d42545b))
- Russia's Grievances Are Legitimate
  Summary:
  Russia's grievances are legitimate, but here's the problem with that argument. very well known that vladimer puten was one of the first, maybe the first person, first leader, foreign leader, to call president bush after the nine 11 tragedy. President bush was not in washington, but eventually they did speak. He offered russian support, which he delivered on use of some russia logistics for our afghanistan operations. And so the attempted co operation blew up. But who was at fault there? Should we blame Russia or should America be held responsible?"
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It's very well known that vladimer puten was one of the first, maybe the first person, first leader, foreign leader, to call president bush after the nine 11 tragedy. They didn't connect right away. President bush was not in washington, but eventually they did speak. He condemned the terrorist attack. He offered russian support, which he delivered on use of some russian logistics for our afghanistan operations. And a lot of people point to that and they say, there it is, russia wanted to co operate and did co operate, and we spurned them, or we failed to appreciate russia's co operation, and so therefore russia was cheated, or russia was lied to. Russia's grievances are legitimate, but here's the problem with that argument. Lex in exchange for that support, vladimer puten asked, in return, from president bush, for a free hand in the former soviet space that closed hiearchical sphere of influence where russia would exert influence, coercive over countries that were sovereign. And no american president could grant that. And president bush was right. He said no. And so the attempted co operation blew up. But who was at fault there?
