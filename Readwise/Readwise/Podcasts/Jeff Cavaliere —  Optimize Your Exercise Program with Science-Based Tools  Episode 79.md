  love the idea of bringing some mental challenge and some desire to improve a skill while conditioning. That's not something that i've thought of before, and it's simply because i've overlooked it. But it makes sense. Because my sister, who's reasonably fit, i'm always trying to get her to do a bit more. She always asks me, what should i take? And i believe her in supplements for certain people in certain instances. But i keep telling her, you know, the behaviours are going to ande. Nutrition are ging to have the greatest outsize, possitive effect. And she loves things like um dance classe and things, or kick boxing, these counds of things, which so it make sense that if you can hook somebody on the conditioning aspect or the skill aspect, and can't trick them into doing more cardio, so to speak, that that's terrific. Also, the neuro scientist in me just has to say, forgive me a that any time you're engaging the ouow tha two sets of motor narons, the ones in your brain, the upper motor rons, and the ones in your spinal cord. Any time you're engaging those upper motor nerons, which are for deliberate, well controlled action, you're doing a great thing for your brain in terms of brain longevity. So i now i need to incorporate some actual skills in my training. Am going back to t training a bit. One of the most important things i learned from you over the years was that when training to increase muscle size, to really think not so much about moving weights, but more about challenging muscles. I also heard this from my friend ben ski, who was very well accomplished. He was a body builder. Now he's in other aspects of fitness. Teach his fitness, but don't move weights. Challenge muscles, unless you're trying o power lift or something of that sort, which i'm not immensely helpful. But the other thing that i learned from you, that i combined with that, was this idea that certain muscles will grow better and get stronger much more easily, maybe even will recover better, because of our ability to contract them really hard.

- The Cavalier Test
  Summary:
  When training to increase muscle size, think not so much about moving weights, but more about challenging muscles. If you can flex your bicep to the point where it hurts a little bit, that's a pretty good indication that you're going to be able to stimulate that muscle well under load. And that's the feeling i should aim for t each repetition, maybe even throughout the repetition.

And this what i call the cavalier test, which is a, at least if i could paraphrase the so for instance, if i can a, it's always bicep, isn't. Let's use i let's use the calf or the bicep. If you can, if you can flex your bicep to the point where it hurts a little bit, like, it almost feels like a cramp, or a cramp, or you can flex your calf to the point where it really cramps up a loab, it almost fels like its nodding up, that's a pretty good indication that you're going to be able to stimulate that muscle well, under load, if you're doing the movement properly. And that's the feeling i should aim for t each repetition, maybe even throughout the repetition. For me, this completely transformed my results.

- The Mind Muscle Connection
  Summary:
  The mind muscle connection is a real thing when it comes to predicting results, and that you can get better at it. This was, i think it may be five, six years ago that i first heard this from you,. body parts that, for me, lagged behind, that i thought maybe genetically were ona work for me, immediately just started growing right. And i was getting stronger and stronger. I've dedicated a portion of my research along in collaboration with another group to try and understand what's happening in these upper motor nrons in the brain that can engage the muscles even more.

So, ah, forgive me for paraphrasing your incredible content around this made a tremendous ence for me and a number of other people that have passed that along too. But what can first?

  Summary:
  The mind muscle connection is a real thing when it comes to predicting results, and that you can get better at it. For me, this completely transformed my results. The cavalier test is whether or not you can cramp the muscle in the absence of load. Just lexing it to the point where it hurts would be a good indication that you could grow that muscle.

How did you arrive at this kind of cramp test, the cavalier test, as i'll call it. It's always weird when people name things after themselves and other scientists. So there is now officially the cavalier test is whether or not you can cramp the muscle in the absence of load, just lexing it to the point where it hurts a little bit, that would be a good indication that you could grow that muscle.

- Sleep is the Way to Get Smarter
  Summary:
  Sleep is the way to get smarter, provided you're also doing the learning part. One of the major changes that i made to my sleep behavior is to not have the sheets tucked in at the end of the and i'll tell you, this had a profound impact on several things. My back pain from running. My shin splints appeared. My posture improved, although his audience will tell me that it still needs improvemet.

  a not tech industry geegs, but ye, like like tech gear. What's it called again, is a hand gripp dynamometer. Hand grippd dinanop done. Oma sad said, wa off with it with a great east cost accident by me and a terrible abachito west coast version. Am, thank you. We'll wl put that in the show notes also. Um, o, i think recovery is key. We always hear about sleep. You grow when you sleep. And incidentally, your brain, you stimulate learning when you 're awake, obviously, but the reordering of neural connections happens in sleep. This is why sleep is the way to get smarter, provided you're also doing the learning part. This. Sleep is the way t stronger it you're also doing the training part. You've had some reall interest. You've put out interesting content over the years in terms of even sleep positionah, one of the major changes that i made to my sleep behavior is to not have the sheets tucked in at the end of the and i'll tell you, this had a profound impact on several things. First of all, my feet always been the bane of my existence. Broke them a bunch. Scape wording they and i noticed when i'd run, i'd get shin splint and. And then i started to notice that my feet sort of a, you're the p t, they're kind of floppy and the as if i was pointing my toes slightly all the time at rest, if i was um. And i realized that, based on listening to you ously, that my sheets were wrapped tight, not hotel tightght. Nothing in the hotel gare fedin. And i started on releasing the sheets at the end of the bed. And i also started doing some tibialis workm front shins work. Essentially changed everything. My back pain from running. My shin splints appeared. My posture improved, although my audience will tell me that it still needs improvemet. There always five or ten people that once sit up straight. I thought she had chair centar mail dress. Very nice chairs. Rigt, so i'm trying, by i'm trying there, am. But this is fascinating, right? Um, the position tha, one sleeps in. Um, i'd fortunately have never in shoulder issues. Knock on wood, but maybe yo could just talk, talk to ust a little bit about sleep and sleep position for sake of waking position and movement. This, i think, is a very unique and very powerful way to think about sleep. ([Time 0:50:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1f9591b6-3930-4a56-825d-99ae5d9f1072))

  Summary:
  Some people's opinions are that sleep inthe the position that's most comfortable. You can incur pretty ser injuries in sleep. People will wake up and have, like, a shoulder that did not bother them at all be humming the next day or even for weeks after. So it's understandable that the body can incur some strain and stress if you're sleeping in the wrong way.

I understand that we all want to sleep. That's the gold when we put our head on the pillow s actually fall asleep and wake up in the morning and not know what 'll happen, unless you had a dream. But you know, beyond that, there are certainly physical components to sleep that that is why a lot of times people will wake up and say like that. You can incur pretty ser injuries in sleep. People will wake up and have, like, a shoulder that did not bother them at all be humming the next day, or even for weeks after, because of the one sleep position they put themselves in in a prolonged way, and they happen to have a deep sleep, even through the discomfort. A that can do actually some damage.

  Sleeping on your stomach tus doesn't really have many benefits. You're basically putting yourselves into excessive extension of the lumbar spine, which for most people isn't very good.

One of the things i say right upto the bat is, sleeping on your stomach tus doesn't really have many benefits. You know, you're your putting yourself into a position that is depending upon the orientation of your your or how many pillows you're using. But you're basically putting yourselves into excessive extension of the lumbar spine, which for most people isn't very good. If you're, if you're a disk patient, ah, i guess that might be helpful, you know, for for relocating the disk, but i mean, for the most part. Ah, your hands are then usually not at your sides, but up under your arms. So you've got them into a sort of internal rotation, up over elevation in your head. Is this not a great position? You also have to crank your neck from one side or the other in order to breathe, or youp your face down straight into the pillow. So i would skip that one. And the're some people that are total belly sleepers. Andnd, i would just say, listen, i don'tik that is the most healthful, long turm way for you to sleep. Try to adopt a different position, a sleeping on your side, oftentimes is. ([Time 0:52:31](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8ee96298-8107-4e7d-a32c-386449b8f456))

And it just is reinforcing, you as we said too. Yo, let's say you trained that day, you're just reinforcing muscle shortening overnight. We know, were where the body is healing and trying to create some, you know, changes in your body. One of the reasons why i recommend stretching, or static stretching, prior to going to bed, lapele, don't really want to do it at that point, because it could take ten minutes, five ten minutes, dependig upon how many muscles you have to stretch. But ynow, it's good to sort of try to establish this longer length temporarily, prior to going into a state where you're gong to be not moving and covering and in in creating new changes in the ([Time 0:53:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8bcc7994-89a4-4772-ab50-d1be115fb3e2))
- Static Stretch before Sleep
  Summary:
  Stretching is reinforcing muscle shortening overnight. You're going to havethes this a prolonged plenreflection that's going to likely lead to shorter calves over time. The side sleepr side sleeper could be very, very helpful for somebody that has apnea or, you know, other conditions.

So a, you know, that kind of, i don't say it doesn't rule out the theside sleepr side sleeper could be very, very helpful for somebody that has apnea or, you know, other other conditions. So, again, it's not an an all or nothing approach, but it just is that you need to pay attention to, ah, when you are on your back, like you were talking about, and your feet are wedged underneath a tight sheets at the end of the bed. And most of us, unless we consciously are pulling them up, don't prefer our beds to have really loose sheets at the end of the beds, harder to make the bed in the morning, right? So, like, you're going to want to have the of them tight. Wellim saying as you experience, you know, you're going to havethes this a prolonged plenreflection that's going to likely lead to shorter calves over time.

  Summary:
  People who get uncomfortable that way en in their sleep, will shift away from that by turning either on to their side of their stomachs.

  bed. And most of us, unless we consciously are pulling them up, don't prefer our beds to have really loose sheets at the end of the beds, harder to make the bed in the morning, right? So, like, you're going to want to have the of them tight. Wellim saying as you experience, you know, you're going to havethes this a prolonged plenreflection that's going to likely lead to shorter calves over time. A, because you're lacking all that length for long period of time that you could have if you just loosened up the sheets and allowed your feet to just, you know, hang out where they are now, the resting position of the ankle, as not indorse reflection, is going to be still in some planerfection, but not being driven down and pulled down into that position a and i think what happens actually, as people who get uncomfortable that way en in their sleep, will shift away from that by turning either on to their side of their stomachs. So there is definitely an impact of the body position in sleep, in figuring out the best way that you can still sleep, of course, and get your rest, but have a mindful eye towards what is doing to your body, and choose the one that's least embrace to your body is the way you should go.

- Dynamic Stretching Is Not Doed For That Purpose
  Summary:
  Part of the healing and recovery process means a shortening of the muscles. This is the tensing up in theet leap. When you're sleeping, it tends to you on the side of shorter rather than longer. So i think we, we want to do something that we whatever we can, whatever little weapons we have in our arsenal that could allow us to do this prior to sleep.

  If i want to, sorryt interrupt stretching later in the day, because m intrigued by this con of heel shorter. So part of the healing and recovery process means a shortening of the muscles. This is the tensing up in theet leap. Could you elaborate just a bit on that? And then, sorry to break your flow, but the an
  Speaker 1
  s basically, you know what? What's been shown is that when, when the repair process, muscular repair, from, lets say, strength riting during the day, the repair process usually results in a muscle that is slightly shorter, rather than increased in length. You know, its isthat. It's, your muscles prefer to sort of yo ratchet their way down into that that contraction, and then you maintain that that that more comfortable length tension relationship. So when you're sleeping, it tends to you on the side of shorter rather than longer. When an ideall, we don't really want that. We want to maintain as much of that length, because with more length, we actually have more leverage, right? That muscle has more leverage to contract if it was all the way contracted. Yeu really can't ois weu know, generate much force in a muscle that's already maximumly contracted. So i think we, we want to do something that we whatever we can, whatever little weapons we have in our arsenal that could allow us to do this prior to sleep.

  Summary:
  "I have flat feet. It looks like i got flippers took if i took my shoes off like thatwearing scoop a fence," she says. "You're just, your body's not built to absorb the forces like the ball your foot could." The goal is to be able to wear your ing as if you were almost effortlessly dancing without a rope.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So i i love, you know, whatever people wind up doing. But iam amazed. There are people, i just started following this young woman on mister graham who is like, a, i'll give her a plug. I thes anna skips or something. She is ridiculous. Like, i watch her and i'm like, mesmerized at what she can do with the rope. You know, it's like itis, an extremely athletic endeavor. Bve when it gets to be at that level, in the speed and the precision ind the you now in. And, you know, i think one of the goals that you want to be able to have is to wear your ing as if you were almost effortlessly dancing without a rope, like where you're just bouncing off with the ball of your foot. A, it's an important skill to learn too, whether you go back to rum or, you know, or even even jog, right? Just like more casual running, learning how to land is so important. One of the drills that people should try is, like, try to jump on your heels. So just stand up, pull your toes off the ground, and just jump from your heels and land on your heels. You'll feel it in your jaw. You'll ritly feel your jaw rattle when you land on your heels. There is no shock absorption capabilities through your heels. Meantime, a lot of people land on their heels a lot when when they run. And you're just, your body's not built to absorb the forces like the ball your foot could. It's really built as a spring. And in the foot is, to me, as a physical therapist, the foot has always been one of the most medium you talk about having bad feet. I have flat feet. It looks like i got flippers took if i took my shoes off like thatwearing scoop a fence. ([Time 1:09:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/03af6c76-821f-4073-a61b-33edbbd6e3a7))
- I Have Flat Feet
  Summary:
  The foot has always been one of the most medium you talk about having bad feet. There is no, there is no adaptability of that foot to the surface when it's completely caved and flattened like that. You're going from a mobile adaptor to a rigid lever. That rigid lever literally locks up the mid tarsal joint to come solid so that you can push off it with leverage.

There is no, there is no adaptability of that foot to the surface, you know, ne when it's completely caved and flattened like that. The jobof of the foot is to be adaptable. Well, there is, maybe there is some adaptability because it's so floppy. But at the same time, at some point, that critical juncture when you're going to then step through and you need to be able to push off, the foot has to actually change in the mid foot itself to become a rigid lever, as they call it. You're going from a mobile adaptor to a rigid lever. That rigid lever literally locks up the mid tarsal joint to come solid so that you can push off it with leverage. If you lack that capability, all those stresses that are supposed to be borne by the foot go up into the ankle and to the knee and to the hip and to the low back.

- Internal External Rotation of the Shoulders
  Summary:
  The only muscle group that actually externally rotates the shoulders can be the rotator cuff. Unless you are devoted to training through external rotation and exercises that are going to externaly rotate the shoulder, youare not training that function. But why this is so important, not just for weight training, but as it terms iposture in mechanicsdand not looking like a melted candle,. I am happy to talk about it, caus i love, i love the shoulder as a joy. Pts tend to fall in love with certain areas, and the shoulder s one of the cool areas for me.

  Speaker 1
  So,
  Speaker 2
  but here, here's the reason for asking about this. I've never really cared much for upright rows. It's not an exercise i tended you. But one thing that's apparent in all my colleagues and every child i see and every adult i see, is that almost everybody is in inward rotation now. Am, so folks think of you stit. I think i learn this from you also. If you stand up straight, and then you just point your thumbs out. Am, like a, like a thumb's up, but you're just pointed. Your hands are down your you point your thumbs straight out. Ideally they would go straight outmost people, the thumbs aen't be pointing toward one another, because most people are starting to look somewhere between a a, a non um human primate um and a melted candle um, you know, bent at the hips, et cetera, from too much sitting. We're all sitting. Were in inward rotation, but i learn from you that the upright road compromises some important aspects of our shoulder mechanics. And cabea a sort of dangerous movement in some ways. I'm sure there's a safe way for people to do it. But so i've always made it a point now, on the basis of this advice, to not do upright roas but in doing them before, but to really strive for a external rotation on things like bench tips, on, on a number of different things. Whenever i can, i try and go into external rotation, provided without looking like an idiot, walked round with my palms facing outward. Please tell us about internal external rotation. A, the upright is one aspect of that. But why this is so important, not just for weight training, but as it terms iposture in mechanicsdand not looking like a melted candle, or a partially melted candle. I
  Speaker 1
  actually love. I am happy to talk about it, caus i love, i love the shoulder as a joy. Pts tend to fall in love with certain areas, and the shoulder s one of the cool areas for me. Tis like the foot is, but like the shoulder, has the most mobility in the body of any of any joint, but it's also got the least stability, right? There's always that trade off of mobility and stability. So your stability comes from, you know, anmuscle groups. And one of the ones that, the only muscle group that actually externally rotates the shoulders can be the rotator cuff, ok? And unless you are devoted to training through external rotation and exercises that are going to externaly rotate the shoulder, youare not training that function.

And unless you are devoted to training through external rotation and exercises that are going to externaly rotate the shoulder, youare not training that function. And it's so easy for us in everyday life, especially those that aren't training, to not ever really undergo any of those stresses that could be beneficial to counteracting what happens freely and naturally, which is internrotation. So when you think about the balance created just by nature and how we live our lives, inter rotation far far outweighs extern rotation. So you need to address it. And the reason why you need to address it is because you need to normalize those bio mechanics of the shoulder if you want their long term held. And one of the functions of the shoulder is to raise our arm up over our head. ([Time 1:15:31](https://share.snipd.com/snip/eda177f8-8886-4fc3-9b1d-331ae8a69a36))
- Is External Rotation Good For Back Pain?
  Summary:
  The more exercise you can do in external rotation, the better it seems on average. For those listening, a you can think of inward rotation as like thumbs down. Now it makes, i makes us being able to train for a long period of time and feel good.

  Now
  Speaker 2
  it makes, i makes us being able to train for a long period of time and feel good. You don't know, i am proud to say, you know, and i don't have the kind of geneic swelick. We don't have a lot of impressive athletes in our family tree or ithin there are always some fit individuals, some less fit individuals. But i really beieve i's about putting in the work consistently over time. And the more, the more often you can wake up not in pain, the better am. And so, you no, i think that being an external rotation as often as possible as good. This a good friend who's a a yoga teacher told me, this is also a problem with the yogis, you know, a lot o all the downward dog stuff. For those listening, a you can think of inward rotation as like thumbs down. Just think thumbs down inwaration. Isn't bad, but less thumbs down, more thumbs up. Is external rotationso for those just listening, maybe that gives a visual. The more exercise you can do in external rotation, the better it seems on average. Em, i'd love to chat with you just a a little bit more about bil mechanics, um and. And this is a personal thing that that, again, your contact really helps all. For me, one is, i thought i had lower back pain. Thought i had siatica so badly that on a few trips, i a worked trips years ago when i was doing a lot more international travel, i mean, it was hard to stand up sometimes. I mean, excruciating pain. I didn't want to take medication. I want do back surgery a in the end, turns out it wasn't back jury at all. And one of the things that helped fix it was this, just learning about this thing called the medial glute. And you had a video that said, fix back pain. And then you quite accurally state that some back pain isn't really about the back at all. And am and had me do an exercise, oror allowed me to try and exercise, where i lay on my side and i sendsle pointed my my toe down, the top, toe down, almost like pointing the toe down. And then would slowly lift the leg up while pointing the toe down.
  Speaker 1
  Maybe i got itrector. And
  Speaker 2
  then holding that. And there's, there's a muscle that sort o sits at the top of the glot, kind of peeks out every once in a while. You can feel it there with your thumb, which i think you had, you push back on it a bit.

- How to Fix Back Pain
  Summary:
  A lot of people think they have back pain when they don't, says the author. He does an exercise that he believes helps his medial glut - a brain area involved in muscle contractions.

And and there, with proper exception, the actual feeling of a muscle, literally with with a limb. We know the based on the neural circuits for movementth that enhances the contractile ability of a muscle. So lict if you touch your bicep, you literally can contract it mor more strongly. And this makes total sense based on aa ner muscular physiology. So have me do that repeatedly. I start doing that in my hotel room, and the pain started to disappear. And then it came back again the afternoon. So i did it again in the afternoon. So this is something i did for three or four days and alone behold my back pane's gone. I handed this off to my father, because he, like me, has a slightly lower right shoulder. I think our gait is probably thrown off by this. Is pria genetic etor, who knows? He handed it off to somebody. You know, it turns that we don't suffer from back painnd, in fact, now i don't suffer from any pain, because i was doing this exercise, which i think is helping my my medial glut. Two reasons why i raise this. One, i know a lot of guys who have the right side satica, conble to keep the wallet there, as one idea, or left side siatica. Thereare a lot of male and female, who think they have back pain when they don't actually have back pain. And the other thing is that is about a general question about byal mechanics, or statement about bya mechanics. I had a feeling that a lot of what people think is back pain, or knee pain, her neck pain, her head ache, or shoulder an is actually a the consequence something that's happening above or below that sight of pain. And ah, this is a whole landscape o stuff relayed to p t andn and recovery and pain management. But maybe you just educate us a bit on this and why this works? What is the medial glut? Why did it make my so called back pain disappear? And a, how
  Speaker 1
  should people think about pain? And i' like to use his a sa, way to get into a li deeper discussion about pain and recovery. Sure. So there there.

- If you have pain in the body, its roots is almost never the same place
  Summary:
  The body is a series of bands pulling in different directions at different levels of tension. You're being pulled into one direction or the other, from one weak area to one dominantly tight area. Most often wherever you're feeling the pain is absolutely not to itis, not the blame. It is somewhere above or below, as you hinted at.

  hip. Same thing is in the shoulder. In this act, she seguates nicely into what into the whole constit you are talkingbout. Like the body is like a mirror image. The hip is like the shoulder, right? The ankle is the wrist, the foot is the hand, like there, there they funk the knees, the elbow, their two hinge joints. They function that way well. With the shoulder, you've got that mobility that comes from having all that freedom of motion, but the stability is lacking. Well, the same thing with the hip. Like, you've got mobility, but if you don't fully stabilize it by training all the muscles of the hip, and if you don't strengthen the external rotation of the hip, then, you know, youe, you're going to have issues. I di not bile mechanically going to work the same way. If you think of the body as a series of bands pulling in different directions at different levels of tension, you know, you're being pulled into one direction or the other, just by the balance of tension, from one weak area to one dominantly tight area. And you need to make sure that you can sort of balance this out in order to eliminate some of the adaptations and compensations that happen. So what i say, when we look at sort of the the a, the the body as a whole, most often wherever you're feeling the pain is absolutely not to itis, not the blame. It is somewhere above or below, as you hinted at. You know, you're talking about the the knees. My favourite example of it, whenever you have nee pain, telteaitis, which i i have forever.

- The source of body pain is almost always above or below, usually below
  Summary:
  People with chronic ankle sprainers are almost always going to wind up having back pain, because the ankle sprain causes weakness and maladaptations in the ankle that then gets connected through the chain. Some people with low back pain usually have hip issues, weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues. It's almost always below.

  bottom? All of a sudden that train track on the bottom gets torked just a little bit? Well, who's going to feel that the most? The area where it's torking, which is at the knee. So the stress are going to be felt there. Meanwhile, the problem is the foot, or the problem is the ankle. People that are chronic ankle sprainers are almost always going to wind up having back pain, because the ankle sprain causes weakness and maladaptations in the ankle that then gets connected through the chain. Because now, once i distort the ankle on the shin, now the knee is trying to maintain its ability to hinge smoothly, so it torks on the femur to do that, while the femer's now inside the hip joint pulling on the pelvis, and the pelvis is ot of whack. So it's realief. It's really as fascinating. Like, it's one of my favorite things about how the body works, is like how it interconnected it is, and how one little thing somewhere causes repercussion somewhere else. And the easiest way to find out what your problem is is to say, i know where my symtem is, but i got to find someone who can help me find the source somewhere else. Because it is going to be usually either above or below, mostly usually below, because it usually translat up the connectict chain. But usually it's going to be below where the real source is. Some people with low back pain usually have hip issues, weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues. It's almost always below. Am when you get into really high performance athletics, though, it almost works the other way, like where we have picchers who can't, i mean, i'm always fascinated by guys that have a, a tommy john issues, nein their elbow.

- The Biggest Danger to Carbohydrates is their Addictiveness
  Summary:
  The baseball star says he doesn't put and the portionsthat you would generally find in a restaurant. The way they structure meals is it's all rice on the bottom and ha little bit chicken on top. "I'm going to just devote that portion of the plate to the starchy carbohydrate"
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  things. I'm not excluding them, but i don't put and the portionsthat you would generally find, you know, my wife and i will go out and will go the restaurant sometimes, like, because we travel quite a bit. Are used to, at least with baseball too, there is a cheesecake factory everywhere you went. And i love cheesecake factory. But like, the way they structure meals is it's all rice on the bottom and ha little bit chicken on top. I mean, it's a plateful of rice that you wouldn't find me make a plate that way. I'm going to just devote that portion of the plate to the starchy carbohydrate. And so it gives me a little bit more responsibility in terms of portion control. Cause those are the foods a, again, probably younow, don't mean driven, that are most easily overeaten. I always asked the question, how it was the last time you ate ten chicken breasts at a meal, like you're getting sick of it after maybe two or three. But you could eat a whole hel of a lot of carbohydrate, starching carbohydrates, because t they're just so satisfying. And i think those triggers, as you said, they want more. Like that's what happens, right? You just keep even when you're feeling full, you want more. Ah, and that's the biggest danger to carbohydrate. So if you can develop some sort of discipline around them, a, then you can still enjoy them. If you can't develop that discipline a, for whatever reason, then maybe they do become something that you have to work yourself around or adopt. The differnt eting style. As i said, i'm never to the point where i'm not trying to be dogmatic in my approach. I'm always trying to say, this is how i do it, and i'm a believer in it, just like everyone else's believer in their method.
