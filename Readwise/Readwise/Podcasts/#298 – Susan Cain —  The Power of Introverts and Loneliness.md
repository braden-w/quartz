  Yes, imeni had, this comes from louis louis at a show. Damn, mi, love that line. I mean, there'sa he talks of an older gentleman. Anda, louis is all sad about a losing a loved one, or like getting rejected, essentially like a break up. And then the older gentleman gives some advice, saying, like a basically criticizes louis for saying, why are you moping around? Because this is the most, this is the best part. Like losing love is the best part, is it? That's the real loss, is when you forget, like feeling shady about having gone through a break up, is when you most intensely appreciate what that person meant to you, that you most intensely feel love in some strange way, by realizing that you've lost it, by missing it, wishing at this moment, i wish i had that, like that feeling, that that's when you feel that love the most, the absence of it. And sotha, the a gentleman gives advice that that's the best part, and if you're good with it, it can last for the longest. It could be the most sort of prolonged experience of deep appreciation and emotion and so on. So that that's kind of a, that's a nice way to look at loss,
  Speaker 1
  which is a reminder of how much somebody meant to us. ([Time 0:37:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/273362ea-b8b3-4028-815c-71f4b79c09dd))

  Well, oh my god, there's a lot to say. So on the bitter sweet side of things, the wisdom that i would give is that, especially for kids who are growing up in relative comfort with everything going pretty lem, they get the idea that real life is when things are going well, and when things don't go well, it's like a detour from the main road, as opposed to understanding that it's all the main road. M and i tell the story book of this time that we went on this family vacation where we rented a house in the countryside. And the house was next to this field where where lived two donkeys that our kids fell in love withand they were like really little at the time, two boys, and they're spending all this time feeding carrots to the donkeys, and it's all beautiful. And then comes the day wher they realize that we're leaving, and like two days, and they're never going to see these donkeys again. And they start crying themselves to sleep. And the usual things that parents might say at a moment like that, like, you know, maybe we'll come back, or another family will feed em, we'll feed these donkeys, none of that made any difference. But when we said to them, you know, good bye is part of life, and this this feeling you're having, everybody has it. You've had it before. You're goig to have it again. You'll feel better in a couple of days. Am, but this is the way it's supposed to be. This is natural. That's when they stopped crying, because i think that's when they stopped resisting. Yo. Like, it's one thing to feel the pain of good bye, and it's another thing to be feeling like this isn't supposed to be happening. It's the resistance part of this isn't supposed to be happening that makes life really difficult. Yes, i so on more clear eyed view of what it really is. This
  Speaker 2
  is indeed supposed to be happening. There's a show called yellowstone that has recently started watching.
  Speaker 1
  Ye, no, i've heard of it. We actually started watching it. But only a few minutes, and didn't get into it, so there's just a quick spoiler of any ([Time 1:47:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cbc5de8f-0993-4332-a0a1-6c80854fea07))
- Good Bye Is Part Of Life
  Summary:
  There's a show called yellowstone that has recently started watching. The father says that everybody killed in this life. That's the way each one of us was going to get killed. We intend to think of humans aaren't, aren't supposed to be killed. But you know what? We do.

  This
  Speaker 2
  is indeed supposed to be happening. There's a show called yellowstone that has recently started watching.
  Speaker 1
  Ye, no, i've heard of it. We actually started watching it. But only a few minutes, and didn't get into it, so there's just a quick spoiler of any kind. But there is a father taking
  Speaker 2
  out the son for the first time to go hunting. And e ought to shoot the first buck. And the sonst really sad, because he pulls the trigger and he took a life. And the father says that everybody killed in this life. That's the way of nature. That's the way each one of us was going to get killed. Andit's interesting, because i didn't really think of it that way, because you think you'd die. But he really framed it as killed, because he's like, there's no such thing as dying of old age. Let's medically let's discuss that a bit. But ah, basically, there's something, whether it's a truck or a bacteria, something is going to kill you in the end. And that wasn interesting way to look at it, because we intend to think of humans aaren't, aren't supposed to be killed. We think of murderas one of the sins, or of one of the things that you don't do in society. But you know what? We do. That's a more technical discussion o f whether we ultimately get killed by something in the end. But ito some degree that's true, at least for most of us, that there's something that guesses, whether it's cantser those kinds of things.

- Always Have a Plan B
  Summary:
  Our vaguest nerve also activates when we see another being in distress. The theory is that that's an evolutionary design, because we had to be able to respond to the cries of our infants,. And from that ability grows the greater ability to respond to other people's cries, too. We've already given plenty of advice, but broadly, what advice would you give to young folks about career or life?

  Speaker 1
  I mean, we have like, really early signs of it from the research, and i'm sure we're just at, they scratching the surface stage. But like, we know, for example, that, you know, the vaguest nerve, which is so fundamental that it governs our breathing and our digestion, that our vaguest nerve also activates when we see another being in distress. Tir is like an instinctive impulse to want to make it stop. Am, and the theory is that that's an evolutionary design, because we had to be able to respond to the cries of our infants, you know. And from that ability grows the greater ability to respond to other people's cries, too. So that's probably just, you know, like the very step in being able to understand what all that is.
  Speaker 2
  We've already given plenty of advice, but broadly, what advice would you give to young folks to day, about career or about life? Whether they want to be writers, lawyers, scientists, musicians and artists, er the heck they want to be, how can they live a life they can be proud of? Oh,
  Speaker 1
  car, here's what i think, you should absolutely do that thing that you're dying to do, but you should always have a plan, b am, and like, a back up plan and a way of earning a living no matter what happens. Because for i feel like people, we, we have this narrative in our culture like that the glamorous thing is to figure out the thing you love and then risk everything to achieve that. But first of all, a lot of people aren't comfortable with that level of risk. And second, when you're living with that level of risk, that's a cognitive load too.
