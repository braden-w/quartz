- The Pain Killer And The Joy
  Summary:
  We do a lot of painful things, and we just kind of assume that's the way it's supposed to be. For me, you know, when i go a to other places, living in balley or living in paris, or whatever, and i'm not driving. I'm walking or using a scooter. Different thing. When you get rid of that, you're like, oh my god. I didn't know that this was so much better. So there's, there's something in book that's called out night.

And you find out there's other ways of living and there's freedom. When you get rid of that, you're like, oh my god. I didn't know that this was so much better. So there's, there's something in book that's called out night. I deemed it the virus of doubt. And what the virus of doubt is is, when there's pain and it's been habituated away, you use the right marketing messages to to bring people back to that initial experience they had, or the initial experiences they had of that pain. Doyou remember when the first time you did blow and it felt like this, right? And then you reawaken that habituated pain, and people idn it becomes visceral.

Customers support details. So they understand thate. If they're not the customer that it's intended for, they start to live through and through their eyes, and see through their eyes of that customer, so

  they make better decisions. And there's probably fascinating, beautiful tensions between that. Instead of the the the engineers, oh, that's cool.

It's not there are electrical designs. There's a i design s. They are as data scientist, designers. Everybody has design and there's a chapter in the book all about that. Actually. Then it's not just you go to the mount and it comes down and you're enlightened. It's each person brings there their form of design and their craft.

- Opinion Based Decisions
  Summary:
  You can't fall back on any data or any previous history to kind of inform you of what's going on, right? And so if you look at most companies who are paralyzed and cannot make new innovations and new products, it's because they're trying to turn opinion base decisions into data driven decisions. "If you fail with some of them, you didn't get it right, you'd you then own them and fix them and move on," he says.

  You can't fall back on any data or any previous history to kind of inform you of what's going on, right? And so if you look at most companies who are paralyzed and cannot make new innovations and new products, it's because they're trying to turn and this is what i saw at phillips they're trying to turn opinion base decisions into data driven decisions so they don't lose their jobs. So if you look at management consulting, management consulting is all about in those opinion base decisions, giving em to someone else to turn into data that comes back to them and says, they can blame the management consultants when something goes wrong, as opposed to, it wasn't me, right? When you need to have to tell that story, you have to understand that, especial v one, you need to be able to a articulate those, those opinion based decisions, and you need to own them. And if you fail with some of them, you didn't get it right, you'd you then own them and fix them and move on, right? Version one of the yepod wasn't perfect. Version one of the iphone wasn't perfect. We got a lot of opinion based decisions wrong. But as you go through, because you got more data, ecause v two, you had data on those original opinions, and then you were able to then modulate off of that, right? And you'l still have new opinions, because those are differentiators that yo a we call differentiators tha things that, you know, move to move the product forward.

  Summary:
  I am the supreme leader that wasn't like that, when he just had a very strong opinion. And if you came with the right thing, you know, you you could modulate that, but you had to come with the team. So that brings up another thing. Ah, you said, challenge the idea, not the person. I've been called a nasselno. But i get when i get really passionate with engineer and teams. In my private life, i'm much calmer and so on. It's always going to be the one that's pickedt those kinds o idiosyncrasies, i idiosyncrasies and that. There's personal quorks of character, like

  And there's personal quorks of character, like you said, fary days and good days, bud days and good so there's also the three tions. You said, you notice that the third option is always going to be the one that's pickedt those kinds o idiosyncrasies, i idiosyncrasies and that. So that brings up another thing. Ah, you said, challenge the idea, not the person. You know, i am somebody who has a, you know, i have a temper ihave a colorful language and so on when on teams. I work.

And if you can bring a great emotional story, but with a great rational story at the same time, why you should do this. And it's like, oh, my god, you bring that super power, that joy, then it all hangs. And

  there's personal drama too, like the human right

- Design and Engineering - Are They Different?
  Summary:
  "A lot of the best engineers i have are not the technical, or that i've worked with are not thetechnical, got to get it exactly right," says Lalala. "They're artists in their own right. They're not just engineers, they're not just desined. They're ampathetic. They really want to bring their best."

I think there's, you know, there's always this, you know, this idea of this, oh, on the mounts designer, and it all comes down, and it all flows down like some magic. It's not there are electrical designs. There's a i design s. They are as data scientist, designers. Everybody has design and there's a chapter in the book all about that. Actually. Then it's not just you go to the mount and it comes down and you're enlightened. It's each person brings there their form of design and their craft. Cause what if they're really, they're artists in their own right. They're not just engineers, they're not just desined. They're artists. They're ampathetic. They really want to bring their best. A lot of the best engineers i have are not the technical, or that i've worked with are not the technical, got to get it exactly right. They're the artists. They came from music, or they came from other things, and they they see that, right? When you work with very rigid engineers, this is the way, the only way. Lalala, those

  They they they understand the practical, practicalnesst they don't have to have the rigidity of this is the way it's done. Like where if you're building something new, all new and revolutionary, none of us are experts at it. And if you come with that expert mindset. Just tell me, and i can give you a story. I should try to give yit that story.

  about that if you come with the expert, and i'm the expert, when you're doing something no one's ever done before, i don't want you on the team, because we all are learning about something that has never been in existence before, and we have to bring that level of vulnerability and openness to new ideas and new ways of doing things throughout the team.
  Speaker 2
  So you want people that are able to have the beginners mind to whatever er. Don't, don't come in as an expert. What's the story? ([Time 1:18:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9721480c-6a5c-48c4-a812-1fe2e2297fa3))

- Opinion Based Decisions
  Summary:
  You can't fall back on any data or any previous history to kind of inform you of what's going on, right? And so if you look at most companies who are paralyzed and cannot make new innovations and new products, it's because they're trying to turn opinion base decisions into data driven decisions. "If you fail with some of them, you didn't get it right, you'd you then own them and fix them and move on," he says.

And so if you look at most companies who are paralyzed and cannot make new innovations and new products, it's because they're trying to turn and this is what i saw at phillips they're trying to turn opinion base decisions into data driven decisions so they don't lose their jobs. So if you look at management consulting, management consulting is all about in those opinion base decisions, giving em to someone else to turn into data that comes back to them and says, they can blame the management consultants when something goes wrong, as opposed to, it wasn't me, right? When you need to have to tell that story, you have to understand that, especial v one, you need to be able to a articulate those, those opinion based decisions, and you need to own them. And if you fail with some of them, you didn't get it right, you'd you then own them and fix them and move on, right? Version one of the yepod wasn't perfect. Version one of the iphone wasn't perfect. We got a lot of opinion based decisions wrong. But as you go through, because you got more data, ecause v two, you had data on those original opinions, and then you were able to then modulate off of that, right? And you'l still have new opinions, because those are differentiators that yo a we call differentiators tha things that, you know, move to move the product forward.

- Challenge the Idea, Not the Person
  Summary:
  I am the supreme leader that wasn't like that, when he just had a very strong opinion. And if you came with the right thing, you know, you you could modulate that, but you had to come with the team. So that brings up another thing. Ah, you said, challenge the idea, not the person. I've been called a nasselno. But i get when i get really passionate with engineer and teams. In my private life, i'm much calmer and so on. It's always going to be the one that's pickedt those kinds o idiosyncrasies, i idiosyncrasies and that. There's personal quorks of character, like

  And there's personal quorks of character, like you said, fary days and good days, bud days and good so there's also the three tions. You said, you notice that the third option is always going to be the one that's pickedt those kinds o idiosyncrasies, i idiosyncrasies and that. So that brings up another thing. Ah, you said, challenge the idea, not the person. You know, i am somebody who has a, you know, i have a temper ihave a colorful language and so on when on teams. I work. In my private life, i'm much calmer and so on. But i get when i get really passionate with engineer and teams.
