# Do Not Be the Child Your Parents Wants. Be the Child You Would Want Your Own Child to Be.
Every time, I stop myself and ask myself, "Would I want my kids doing that?"

This is accomplishes several things:
- It forces us to listen to our own advice.
- Many of us do things that we would not condone our kids to do. We are living too much in the moment, and not enough focusing on what we value.
- Being the child your parents wants makes you more susceptible to the outside world. Being your own child is a useful mental exercises that forces us to think about what we really want
