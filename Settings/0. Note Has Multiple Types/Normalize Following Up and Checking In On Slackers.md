# Normalize Following Up and Checking In On Slackers
Recall the times in which you've been reached out by someone, or sent a text to a friend. Did you feel they were overstepping when they sent a follow up text?

When you leave a friend unresponded, it isn't necessary an expression that you dislike them or don't want to talk to them. If they were to reach out, you would respond positively.

If you feel hesitant to follow up or check in on someone, summon your past experiences.

You're entitled. Remember the times you read texts from friends you cared about but didn't respond? Imagine how little you were bothered when they bumped you? Why not reach out to slackers?
