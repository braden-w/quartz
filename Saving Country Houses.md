# Saving Country Houses
[Author:: Ben Cowell]

- Historic Houses
	- Does not own a single house, but a representative body of house owners
	- "An association of owners and guardians of [[historic houses]], parks and gardens and places of historic interest"
- How many country houses are there?
	- Plausibly around 2000
- Privately owned houses
	- A house with yoga

## The Introduction of [[Estate Tax]], Harcourt Estate Duty
- A study to reveal equal distribution of land
	- Reveals that there is enormous inequalities and massive ownership by a few families
- The [[Estate Tax]] is introduced to balance this out
	- There is a pressure to sell your property before passing away to avoid this tax
- Harcourt
	- Ironically, his older brother passed away and he would inherit the property after two waves of [[Estate Tax]]

## Houses Were Pulled Down
- Families could not afford houses, and they were pulled down and forcibly demolished
	- Often to make money off the architecture
- Some houses burned down in [[Insurance Fraud]]

## Where Historic Houses Comes in
- Lots of concern that increases in taxes would lead to more sales and loss of houses
	- Annual cost of £100,000 to £300,00
	- Houses were selling artwork
- 1 in 6 members of [[Historic Houses]] have sold a painting to fund repair expensives
- Lobbying to stop property taxes on land
- Ruling Labour Party capitulated
	- Open your house for 28 days a year, and you can avoid the 40% [[Estate Tax]]
- 48% of inbound tourists visit historic houses or castles

## Statement
In context with [[Black Lives Matter]] and [[Cancel Culture]].

> Historic Houses believes that the UK should be a country in which everyone feels at home, is respected and is treated fairly.
>
> We can’t change the past, but we believe there is much to be gained from using heritage to contextualise the past and draw out painful, hidden or contested histories. We believe strongly in the value of protecting heritage, learning from it, and using it to create positive social change.

The [[National Trust]] has been hammered by the Tory Party recently.

## How Much Land is Owned?
The National Trust owns 1.5% of the land mass of England. About 70% of it is farmland, that you can't walk on.

Ben Cowell's estimate is that the Historic Houses has around 25-30%.

You don't want to inherit a Country House.
