# [[Progressivism]] is Actually Idealogically Rigid while [[Conservatism]] Flexible

## Flexibility on What is the Good
[[Progressivism]] often requires a more rigid notion of what good or progress is.

[[Conservatism]] is generally more flexible of what is considered good, in part because it generally is more defensive of the [[Status Quo]].

## Flexibility on Modifications to the Status Quo
However, one could also note that [[Conservatism]] is less flexible on the modifications one makes to the status quo, whereas [[Progressivism]] is more flexible so long that it can be towards the idea of progress.
