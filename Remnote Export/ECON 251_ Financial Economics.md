    The problem of all market structures is that  the order flow is fragmented  , which means that prices bounce around the equilibrium price , making Market Making  a profitable business
    Market Making
        How trading occurs
            Market maker quotes Bid  and Ask  prices
                Ask↔Price at which market maker is ready to buy
                Bid↔Price at which market maker is ready to sell
            Holds inventory (risky)
        The market maker sets Bid  and Ask  to  keep inventory zero 
        Bid-ask spread↔Price of this liquidity service
        The reason market makers make money through the Bid-ask spread   is because  they take significant risk  through Holds inventory (risky)
        Ask = $81 |
Bid = $79 |
Bid-Ask spread = $2
        How does the market maker know where to put the bid and ask prices?
            Two vies of the bid-ask spread
                Covers the fixed costs and inventory costs of the market maker
                Protects  market maker from being exploited by better informed traders
            Three main determinants of bid-ask spreads
                Volume of trade | High volume ⇒ low spread
                Volatility of equilibrium price | High volatility ⇒ high spread
                Competition | High competition ⇒ low spread
