    GDP
        3 ways to compute
            GDP as (sum) value added | GDP as final sales
                Value added = sales - material input costs
                Why not use GDP as final sales rather than sum of value added?→Because it's difficult to distinguish the final sales and the intermediate sales. We want to count only value added
            GDP as Gross Domestic Income (Total income of everyone in an economy)
                GDP = payments of labor and capital
                    Payments of capital→Rental expenditures and profits
                    In income, but not GDP→Capital gains and net foreign Income
                    In GDP, but not income→Depreciation
            GDP as Gross Domestic Expenditure
                Y = C + I + G + NX
                    C→Consumption
                    I→Investment (Purchase of capital, housing construction, inventories)
                        Inventories
                        Unsold output goes into inventory and is counted as  inventory investment 
                            Assumption is that firms purchase their unsold output
                    G→Government
                        Purchase of goods and services (does not include transfer like social security and unemployment to avoid double-counting in consumption)
                    NX→Net Exports (Export - import)
            Note: The rent of a house, both actual and would-be cost is included
        Measure GDP of government as  value added  evaluated at their cost
        Measuring GDP  through different methods
            Example 1: GDP as (sum) value added | GDP as final saleshttps://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/6UHasnUhYYqmkNX9qX4cjQDTcGxf0kULSGVBGjOJE44JfucRn5hGA7JH6nGepFK1ZDCIfmxpsiIifHy4h4D-UAq8FAEjrPl_N0R_SunYSy9npLOxrB59yRVZuD2NI75r.png
                value added and GDP→100 + 75 + 125 ⇒ 300

    Nominal vs. Real GDP
        Nominal GDP→GDP using current prices
        Real GDP→GDP using baseline price (price of goods at a certain yer)
        GDP deflator =→\frac{Nominal GDP}{Real GDP}

    Alternative metric, Jones and Klenow
        Assume you have an equal  chance of being born in a country
        Add GDP, Leisure, Welfare, Life Expectancy
    GDP Issues
        High GDP but high savings (like China) = low saving
        High GDP but low leisure (like the US)
