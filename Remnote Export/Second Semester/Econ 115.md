    First Model
        Assumptions: One homogenous   good, many buyers, many sellers
    Demand curve is
        A  demand schedule  listing how much is demanded at each price
        The willingness-to-pay  for the marginal unit
        Sloping down because of the income effect and substitution effect
            Income effect→can't afford all previous consumption
            Substitution effect→other goods are relatively more attractive
        The Law of Demand↔As price increases, quantity demanded decreases (it's not actually a law)
        Why carbon tasks may be unpopular is because it's a  regressive  tax
    Inferior vs. normal goods
        Inferior goods
        Normal goods
    Substitutes vs. Complements
        If price of a good goes up, the demand of substitute goes up
        If price of good goes up, the demand of complement goes down
