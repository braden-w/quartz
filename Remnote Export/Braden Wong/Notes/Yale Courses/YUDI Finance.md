Accrual Accounting
    GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)↔Guidelines accountants use to prepare financial reports
        revenue is “earned” by a company when it provides→a good or service
        revenue and expense does not need to be incurred at the same time as cash is being received
        for example, say Toyota buys $10MM in car parts from suppliers in 2020, but doesn’t sell the cars those parts were used to make until 2022. The $10MM expense will be counted on the Income Statement in the year→2022
        Apple pays one of its software engineers a $300,000 salary in a lump-sum payment at the end of each year. Six months into the year, Apple has incurred $150,000 in expenses even though they have paid $0 in cash.
        An industrial bakery buys $2MM in flour which it will use to make bread and pays immediately in cash. At the time of payment, $0 in expenses have been incurred. Over the next year, the company sells $5MM worth of bread, in which it used $1MM of the aforementioned flour. Throughout that year, the company has incurred $1MM of expenses associated with its flour $2MM purchase.
Three major financial statements that are fundamental to financial analysis
    Income Statement:: Understanding revenues and expenses using Accrual Accounting #[[Accrual Accounting]] 
        all listed items are↔taxable
        general structure
            
            
            
            Revenue
            COGS
            Gross Profit↔Revenue - COGS
            Gross Profit Margin↔Percent of revenue left after cost.Gross Profit / Revenue
            Operating Expenses↔Anything not directly related to price of goods made
                SG&A↔Selling, General & Administrative Expense
                R&D
                D&A
            Operating Income↔Total earnings before tax and interest. Gross Profit - Operating Expenses
            Non-operating costs↔Not reflective of operating costs. Lawsuits, sudden fires, emergencies, etc.
            Pre-Tax Income↔All revenues and expenses except tax. Operating Income - Interest Expense + Other Income
            Tax Expense↔Applied % tax to all previous items, because all listed items are taxable
            Net Income↔Total earnings left for investors after all previous summed. The sum of all revenues and expenses
            Interest Payments
            
        The income statement shows the revenues a company earns and the expenses they incur over a given period of time. Revenues and expenses are accounted for using the accrual accounting method. The sum of all these revenues and expenses lead to a figure called net income, which is a measure of profitability.
    Cash Flow Statement
        purpose is to reconcile→the difference Net Income and the actual flow of cash
        corrects for→depreciation/invisible costs and untaxed income
        Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)
            Net Income
            ADD D&A
            SUBTRACT Accounts Receivable because it hasn't come yet
            SUBTRACT Inventory because increasing inventory means cash has flowed out
            ADD Accounts Payable because we still have the money/haven't paid it out yet
            Pattern Cis to  add  changes in liabilities and  subtract   changes in assets.
        Cash Flow from Investing (in capital and other companies) (CFI)
            Capital Expenditures (CapEx)↔PP&E
            Purchase/Sales of Securities↔Selling/Buying stocks of other companies
            M&A Activity
        Cash Flow from Financing (CFF)
            Equity Issuing/Buybacks
            Debt Issuing/Repayment
            Dividend
        As we learned above, a revenue or expense on the income statement (under accrual accounting) does not necessarily align with an inflow or outflow of cash. Therefore, the net income figure at the bottom of the income statement almost never reflects net inflow or outflow of cash. The cash flow statement is used to reconcile this net income figure to a “change in cash” figure that reflects actual cashflow. In other words, it starts with net income and makes the appropriate adjustments so that we know how much cash entered/left the company in aggregate. Like the income statement, this is showing change over a given period of time.
    Balance Sheet
        used as→snapshot of current assets, debt, equity
        Assets, Debt, Equity Equation↔Assets = Debt (aka Liabilities) + Equity
        Assets
            Cash
            Inventory
            Accounts Receivable
            Prepaid Expenses
            Marketable Securities
            Net PP&E
            Goodwill↔Giving more than a company asks for when buying out and acquiring their assets
        Liabilities
            Accounts Payable
            Deferred Revenue
            Short Term Debt
            Long Term Debt
        Equity
            Common Stock↔# Shares * Par Value
            Additional Paid-In Capital (APIC)↔# Shares * (Share Price - Par Value)
            Common Stock + Additional Paid-In Capital (APIC)→Total Cashflows from stock issuance #[[Additional Paid-In Capital (APIC)]] 
            Treasury Stock↔Amount of money spent repurchasing shares
                it's a Contra-Equity because↔increasing treasury stock decreases equity, there is less of the pie to be financed
            Retained Earnings↔Sum of all periods' (net income - dividends)
        The balance sheet shows a snapshot of company’s asset, liability, and equity items at a specific point in time (unlike the IS and CFS, which show change over a given period of time). 
            The key accounting equation that defines the balance sheet is Assets = Liabilities + Equity

Week 1: DCF's
    DCF
        Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) assumes that a company is worth the  sum  of all its future cash flows, discounted to the present to account for the time value of money.
        DCF is an  intrinsic  valuation method, meaning it doesn't rely on the valuation of other companies.
        Two parts: Explicit + Terminal Periods
            
        Steps for Explicit
            Step 1: Project our FCFF
                EBIT↔Operating Income
                Find EBIT
                Project Cash Flows
                Project Change in Net Working Capital (Current Assets - Current Liabilities)
                FCF = EBIT * (1-Tax Rate)
            Step 2: Discounting Cash Flows
                The discount rate used in DCF is the  WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Cpital)
                WACC↔Cost of Equity * (E/(E+D)) + Cost of Debt * (D/(E+D)) * (1-Tax)
                2a. Cost of equity
                    Cost of Equity is found using the  Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
                    Cost of Equity = R_rf + Beta * (R_m-R_rf)
                        https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/PXv-2mK889ngAf4mBBBSkMRVSBj11HDv-SgPbaDXchSAiu5yeBZAZQX2wWraHZT_ppegf_VY5W-ZA1doYA8fgSMSuRnPCyW_gbb4UadW63LA0mP6TXBx-Qs2wab0PuZ3
                         R_{rf}→ Risk-free rate of return
                        Beta of the equity↔Correlation to the market
                            What's the beta of a slot machine?→0. Because a slot machine is not dependent on the market.
                        Rate of the return of the market
                        “What does beta represent, in plain English?”↔The risk of the company relative to the risk of the stock market as a whole.
        Steps for Terminal
            Two methods: Perpetuity Growth Method or Exit Multiples Method
            Perpetuity Growth Method↔assumes cash flows will continue until infinity, and will grow a low stable rate
                FCF↔First Year Cash Flow
                “What is the formula for unlevered FCF ?”↔FCF = EBIT * (1 – Tax Rate) 
                    + D&A
                    - CapEx
                    - Change in NWC
                General perpetuity formula↔Present value = Initial payment/(Discount rate - Growth rate)
                Terminal Value formula↔Terminal Value = FCF at T+ 1/(WACC-g) = (FCF at T)(1+g) / (WACC-g) where T is the number of years we explicitly forecast
            Exit Multiple Method↔assumes that
                Look at ratios that peer companies are being traded at, assume company will be sold at a  similar ratio  at the end of the explicit forecast 
        
Week 2: Private Equity
    Private Equity Firms
        Private Equity Funds↔separate branches of Private Equity Firms, for legal reasons, vs. firms as the master branch
        How they make money
            Management fee↔Often near 2%
            Carry↔Slice of profits, often after thresholds
        Why is PE profit a lot
        LBO↔Leveraged Buyouts - Acquire with lots of debt
        Multiple of Money (MoM)↔How much we've multiplied our money before exit (New Equity/Old Equity)
        Internal Rate of Return (IRR)↔Annualized effect of compounding interest rate
            formula→(Original Investment) (1+IRR)^T=Final Value&

    Enterprise Value
    Equity Value
    Comparable companies analysis↔Valuation based off metrics of similar companies in same markett
    Precedent transaction analysis↔Valuation based off past buyouts of similar companies
