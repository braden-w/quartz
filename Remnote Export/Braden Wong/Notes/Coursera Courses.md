Dog Emotions & Cognition
    Canine paradox―How did dogs become dogs when they are not close to wolves at first?
        The rise of humans as superpredators―we learn to throw projectiles, outcompete all predators
        All predators wiped except wolves and bears

            Monkeys who figured trap 1 used same strategy on trap 2
            Can trial and error, but not understand causal chain
            Dogs have inferential reasoning―they can learn to open doors with the presence of humans to train/demonstrate how to open

        Tinbergen 4 levels analysis for biological traits
            Phylogenetic (Phylem) - species
            Ontogenetic (Path) - developmental paths
            Functional (Payoff of trait) - what does it allow you to do?
            Proximate (Mechanism) - how does it work?

    Dog Pointer Experiment vs. Chimps
        Dogs understand gestures
            Use rock to point to right one, dogs get right but not Chimps
        Puppies can understand human gestures/novel markers as 6 weeks, while wolves do not have that ability, even when raised by humans
    Empathy is demonstrated early by contagious yawning
        Bonobos―Good-willed and prefer to share w/ strangers
            Closer relatives than chimps, but have none of the dark traits of humans and chimps
            They selected towards interested/less violent males, perhaps due to matriarchy
        Contagious yawning demonstrates social behavior
Philosophy
    Emotivism―moral judgements from emotion
        Knowledge (classical account)―Knowledge is true belief, and requires truth
    Gettier Case Example― 
        Stopped Clock - Bertrand Russell
        Sheep Framer Sees
        Actually thought true, and thought true, but not through understanding or intuition, but luck
        Raise question - If true belief is justified, is it still Knowledge (classical account)?
        Radical skeptic―we know very little
            Brain-in-vat hypo
    Why Obey Law? Theory
        Benefit - Obligated because we benefit

                Hume's Definition of a miracle―a violation of natural law
                    The evidence in favor of a miracle will always be outweighed by the evidence for the law of nature
            Reid
                stance on Hume's Definition of a miracle―Against because of the Principle of Credulity. We are hardwired to rely on testimony--children are most trusting of them from birth. #[[Hume's Definition of a miracle]] 
                Principle of Credulity―We are hardwired to rely on testimony--children are most trusting of them from birth.

        Are Scientific Theories true?
            Views on the construction of scientific theories―
                syntactic―structure
                episteme―why believe?
                semantic―meaning
                
            Identity Theory―mental state = brain activity (mind = neurons)
            Chinese Room―Machines control syntax, but not semantics
            Constructive Empiricist―science aims to produce theories that are empirically adequate rather than true, and to accept a theory involves no more belief than that it is empirically adequate

    Scale―Small group vs. big group in communication
        The Boulder City Council is planning a public meeting to discuss how to manage and develop a new parcel of open space land that the City of Boulder recently acquired. This is an important public issue and many people have strong opinions about what to do--or not do--with the land. The City Council wants citizen input, but there are so many people interested in this issue that it will be impossible to involve everyone at a public meeting. So the City Council creates a "citizen's input panel" made up of ten Boulder residents who will gather input from the entire community and represent these interests to the City Council in a report to be presented at the upcoming public meeting.

            Dummy variables―a variable that takes two values, generally one or zero
                a much better way of using categorical variables in regression
                add one dummy variable for one less than the number of unique values in the categorical variable  
                if the variable is binary, you'd add one dummy
                if there are four categories, you'd add three dummy variables.

    Social Capital (Don't confuse with human capital)―Mutually reciprocal relationships that benefit all, the resources you get from personal and professional relationships
    Nobody wants to work with a deenergizer, even if they know more than someone who makes them feel good
    Nearly 80% of professionals have a blind spot--what they perceive as a strength but others see as a weakness
    Susan Fiske - People make assumptions about your warmth and competence within the first few seconpds of meeting you.
Successful Career Development
    Netweaving―What I can do for you, not what you can do for me (networking)

    My explanations
        Please describe one of your career interests.
            The application of data ownership with artificial intelligence to provide alternate income streams to the public. This is analogous to as if Youtube paid its users a share of their data used to train Machine Learning recommendation models.
        Create a LinkedIn headline that you might use to enter your expressed field of interest.
            Artificial intelligence and data ownership to supercharge business models and economies
        Please explain the link between your career interest and the LinkedIn headline.
            The LinkedIn summary encapsulates my ultimate career interest but also in terms of what employers may seek, alternative business models

The Essentials of Global Health
    Intro / Global Terms
        Social determinant―The conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live and age and the wider set of forces in systems shaping the conditions of daily life.
        Direct determinants of health―Sex, genetics, etc.
        Sustainable development goals (SDGs)―Goals set in 2015 for 2030
        UNICEF―specialized agency of the United Nations system
        Product development partnership―Nonprofit that enables public, private, academic, and philanthropic sectors to work together to enable research for development of diagnostics, drugs, vaccines, etc.
        Which of the following are the specialized agencies of the United Nations that are most involved with health?―UNICEF, WHO
    Mortality rates
        maternal mortality ratio―Number of woman who die from pregnancy related causes for every 100,000 live births
        neonatal mortality rate―Number of deaths to infants under 28 days of age in a given year per 1,000 live births in that year
        As countries get better developed and people live longer in them, neonatal deaths represent a greater fraction of all under five child deaths
    Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY)
        definition―A composite health gap measure that takes account of the years of life lost due to premature death and the years of life spent living with disability
        Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature death―years of life lost due to dying before your time
        Years of Life Lost due to Disability (YLD)―number of years you live with a certain disability multiplied by weight of disability
        equation―Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature death + Years of Life Lost due to Disability (YLD)
        affects men or women more―women
    Epidemiological transition―transition from a disease profile of predominantly Communicable Diseases to one that's predominantly Non-communicable Diseases (NCD)'s
        Non-communicable Diseases (NCD)'s―disease that cannot be spread from person to person
        Communicable Diseases―disease that can be spread from person to person
        Over the last several decades, the share of total deaths attributable to noncommunicable diseases and injuries has increased
    Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs)―group of parasitic and bacterial infections that are mainly prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas

Big History
    Stars
        Population 1
            luminous, they're hot, they're young, and metal-rich
        Population 2
            older, less luminous, cooler, colder, metal-poor
        Massive stars live fast and die young
    Planets
        Formed gently
        Planetary formations past the ice belt enable formations of large gas giants
        Jupiter's rampage into the asteroid belt theory
            Explains why
                Mars is smaller than normal (Jupiter threw away a lot of material)
                No planets near the asteroid belt (the materials there are moving way too quickly to form a planet)
            The only thing that stopped was the resonance of Jupiter and Saturn
        Hundreds of mars-sized protoplanets in the early solar system, only 4 survived and others were ejected
    Earth Moon System
        Collision of protoplanet with Earth, causing melting of Earth
        Peculiar characteristics
            Extraordinary amount of angular momentum
            Moon was molten sometime in its history
            Earth is water, Moon is bone dry
            Chemical and material similarites from Earth
    The Earth
        Earth is extraordinarily dense
            Volume calculated in ancient times, mass extrapolated from gravity
            density = 5.5 tons/cubic meter, but crust is much less dense than this
            Deep earth must be very dense
        Study of shockwaves through
            Slow waves through only solid
                Stopped at 2900 km, indicating change to liquid
            Fast waves through solid and liquid
    Humans
        Collective learning means that humans have acquired more and more information about their environments
        Over time, hominin ancestors became increasingly less sexually dimorphic
        One key cognitive difference between humans and chimpanzees―
            Humans have better abilities to imitate and learn by imitation. Allows more than one teacher, uncles and aunts and etc.
        Collective learning―ability of a species to accumulate more information with each passing generation than is lost by the next.
Nomads
    Palaeolithic―Nomad, characterized by stone tools
    Humans have been foragers for approximately  95  % of their history. 
    What are the four world zones?
        Afro-Eurasia
        Australasia
        Pacific Islands
        Americas
Future
    Climate Change
        Temperatures have only risen about a degree since the Industrial Revolution
        and that doesn't sound like much
