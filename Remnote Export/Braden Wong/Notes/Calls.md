        Animal Welfare | Factory FarmingJuly 1st, 2020
             Why It's Time to End Factory Farming - Quillette
                Think about the horses who were replaced by cars. Cars do the same thing horses do—they move people from one place to another—but without all the crap.
                Farming is inefficent, at a ratio of ~1/10 
                Factory farming: 99% in US, 90% globally
            Equality for Animals?
                Comparison to how slavery was treated as normal
                We are used to regarding the oppression of blacks and women as among the most important moral and political issues facing the world today. These are serious matters, worthy of the time and energy of any concerned person. But animals? Surely the welfare of animals is in a different category altogether, a matter for old ladies in tennis shoes to worry about. How can anyone waste their time on equality for animals when so many humans are denied real equality?
                This attitude reflects a popular prejudice against taking the interests of animals seriously - a prejudice no better founded than the prejudice of white slaveowners against taking the interests of blacks seriously. It is easy for us to criticize the prejudices of our grandfathers, from which our fathers freed themselves. It is more difficult to distance ourselves from our own beliefs, so that we can dispassionately search for prejudices among them. What is needed now is a willingness to follow the arguments where they lead, without a prior assumption that the issue is not worth attending to.
                Would experimenters be prepared to perform their experiments on orphaned humans with severe and irreversible brain damage if that were the only way to save thousands? ( I say 'orphaned' in order to avoid the complication of the feelings of the human parents.) If experimenters are not prepared to use orphaned humans with severe and irreversible brain damage, their readiness to use nonhuman animals seems to discriminate on the basis of species alone, since apes, monkeys, dogs, cats and even mice and rats are more intelligent, more aware of what is happening to them, more sensitive to pain, and so on, than many brain-damaged humans barely surviving in hospital wards and other institutions. There seems to be no morally relevant characteristic
                Capacity for suffering
                    If I give a horse a hard slap across its rump with my open hand, the horse may start, but it presumably feels little pain. Its skin is thick enough to protect it against a mere slap. If I slap a baby in the same way, however, the baby will cry and presumably does feel pain, for its skin is more sensitive. So it is worse to slap a baby than a horse, if both slaps are administered with equal force. But there must be some kind of blow - I don't know exactly what it would be, but perhaps a blow with a heavy stick - that would cause the horse as much pain as we cause a baby by slapping it with our hand. That is what I mean by 'the same amount of pain' and if we consider it wrong to inflict that much pain on a baby for no good reason then we must, unless we are speciesists, consider it equally wrong to inflict the same amount of pain on a horse for no good reason.
                Benjamin Franklin Objection
                    'Well', Franklin said to himself, 'if you eat one another, I don't see why we may not eat you'
                    objections to the Ben Franklin Objection
                        Most animals that kill for food would not be able to survive if they did not, whereas we have no need to eat animal flesh.
                        It is odd that humans should, when it suits them, use an argument that implies we ought to look to animals for moral guidance.
                        Nonhuman animals are not capable of considering the alternatives open to them or of reflecting on the ethics of their diet.
                The Use of Mental Defectives
                    also known as―"the argument from marginal cases"
                    Counterarguments
                        Mental defectives who don't possess the capacities of normal humans should nevertheless be treated as if they did possess these capacities, since they belong to a species which typically possesses them
                        Although mental defectives may not possess higher capacities than other animals, they are nonetheless human beings
                        Slippery slope' argument
            Discussion
                Pain is suffering, suffering is optional.
                Decreasing demand is good but may not necessarily have the desired effect on supply
                    Halving demands doesn't necessarily result in twice as much space per animal, but the same amount and half the size of factories
                    The optimal strategy is not to only decrease the demand of factory farmed meat (which may have an unintended consequence on supply) but to increase the demand of ethically treated meat (which guarantees an intended consequence on supply)
                Chicken sexers
                Domestic sheep don't stop growing wool. Suppose we banned everything; would they all die off?
                The ideal outcome is coexistence that is mutually beneficial to both of us, like dogs
                Is it an evolutionary win to be factory farmed?
                    There are more chickens now than have ever been before
                    If we could help create them, feed them, and give them painless deaths, it could be great
                    If there is a way to reduce suffering in transit from beginning to end, that sounds like an optimal strategy

            Dragon in my garage―Invisible dragon, but there is no way to disprove.
                "Where's the dragon?" you ask.
                "Oh, she's right here," I reply, waving vaguely.  "I neglected to mention that she's an invisible dragon."
                You propose spreading flour on the floor of the garage to capture the dragon's footprints.
                "Good idea," I say, "but this dragon floats in the air."
                Then you'll use an infrared sensor to detect the invisible fire.
                "Good idea, but the invisible fire is also heatless."
                You'll spray-paint the dragon and make her visible.
                "Good idea, but she's an incorporeal dragon and the paint won't stick."  And so on.  I counter every physical test you propose with a special explanation of why it won't work.
                Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all?  If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists?  Your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true.

            Global Priorities research is only valuable if its conclusion is contrary to the status quo?
                Bayesian thinking: The idea that the current evaluation is in itself not 100% accurate, and we must target the alternative outcome in which the test is wrong and the answer is remarkably novel
                Does this create perverse incentives in Global Priorities research to generate a conclusion that is in contrary to current assessments?

            The scarcity mindset - Maslow's hierarchy of needs, freeing up
                Psychologists have shown that we tend to feel more capable of extending moral concern to others if we’re not competing with them for scarce resources and if our own needs are already taken care of. Abraham Maslow famously illustrated this basic concept with his image of a pyramid representing our hierarchy of needs.
                The washing machine, the refrigerator, the electric stove — were a major engine of liberation for women. Once the washing machine was invented and made widely accessible, for instance, women were freed up to do other things, like join the workforce.
                The ethical crux―do people have a moral obligation to engage with politics, etc.?
                    I am sympathetic to a consequentialist view
            Discounting―
                distinction―it is different to discount because you value future lives less, given certain outcome (where you are certain that an action would give a parallel outcome in present and future) compared to because you are less certain of outcome, and value lives the same (EV)
                    Expected Future Utilty = Value of future lives saved * Certainty of outcome

                    Is there a way that the suffering of millions of small sufferings equate to one large suffering?
                    You can't sum suffering of shallow depth to a different depth, in the same way you can't sum intelligence

                    Then you reflect some more: “But, my vote is extremely unlikely to  make a difference. I should not vote, but put my time to better use.”

            Are we living in an influential time?
            Three scenarios
                Peace.
                A nuclear war that kills 99 per cent of the world’s existing population.
                A nuclear war that kills 100 per cent.
                The difference between 2 and 3 is much much bigger than―1 and 2 (even though most people would believe the opposite)
            Are we living in the most influential time in human history?
                In the past, you represented a smaller proportion of the population and would be able to enact a greater percentage of change. However, technology improves the scope of influence
                Population and technology are both exponential growth curves
                    rate of growth comparison―tech is more
                    start comparison―population starts earlier
                    eclipsing―there will be a point in which technology eclipses population and your ability to influence tomorrow will be greater than it is today, not less
            Lock in events―locking in ethical values and unable to change, meaning that before the lock-in event is much more influential
            Is there any action that we can do in the future that adds value to the past?
                inspiration―the primary reason we pick the past is the idea that the past influences the future, but what if we pick future actions because they add value to the past?

                Maximize happiness or suffering? Usually people weigh the sums of one of the following:
                    Happiness + Suffering = Net
                    Happiness = Net
                    Suffering = Net

        Are humans part of nature or not?
            Nature -> Us -> Technology, but now Technology -> Us -> Nature
            We are facing an unprecedented problem as we grow so rapidly, our understanding of nature no longer leads us to fear as much
            Nature controlled us, and we controlled technology. But now, technology controls us, and we control nature.
        What is wilderness? Is it a construct?
            There is an inherent bias in wilderness because it is a construct. We have evolved so quickly that there is no way to have a constant definition of wilderness.
                An animal regards what humans create as nature? To them, nature has erected natural new structures around them.
                A beaver regards a human dam as nature in the same way that a human regards a beaver dam.
                As humans, we have an inherent bias of seeing everything through a human lens.
            Animals do not regard humans as separate, but as other animals. Or as God. Is introducing invasive species morally bad? Animals may view it objectively, while we view it subjectively. Because we have control over our actions and understand it.

            80% of your growing up takes place outside of your control, in your surroundings. Your friends, your job, etc. Doing so would be to not take advantage of the opportunities given to the coming of age

        Not even that you miss 100% of the shots you don't take, but the compliment: that you fail all 100 times is expontentially close to zero, and that doing so should be recognized as a profound achievement.

            Everyone will die
                The culture will not endure, but the system will
                    What if the system that we created, designed to combat a racist culture, is now antiracist to the point of being racist
                Who would you wish to die?
                    Most people will already be irrelevant when they're old, so people who stay relevant are not the rule, but the exception
                    Therefore, I wish people to live longer
                Who should live longer?
                    People should live longer
                        Vietnam, World War II, Holocaust survivors
                        Anyone who grew up with conventional warefare
            Pushy girls?
            Give everyone a stable income  The issue isn't inequality (or inequity I guess), but a lack of cash
                Give Trump supporters a stable income, they wouldn't support Trump
                Give young college students a stable income, heck they might be conservative
            When you're strapped for cash and the only problem is to get enough money, it's easy to scapegoat the millionaires and billionaires
            When you have cash, even able to purchase the products that these billionaires made possible, I would dare say that your life would be very different
            Success gives you a different kind of perspective
            Live life as a sprint, not a marathon
                Approach the day as a series of sprints, and zoom out and marathon. Marathon of sprints. 2 hours of continuous work is worse than 30 minutes in 4 splits
            The best advice: avoid zero days at all costs. Live nonzero
                Anything more than zero is improvement. Zero is atrophy. If I get nothing done in a day, it sucks. But if I do one push-up, I get stronger. If I do one math problem, I get smarter. Avoid nonzeroes at all costs

    Call with Yalies, Longtermism-Not applications, but philosophic implications
        Race to Mars--Good thing?
            I think we're thinking of this as inherently zero sum when it doesn't have to be
            Growing the pie, not the slice
            Perhaps the allocation is not optimal, but an increase in innovation in general is a net positive for society
        The romanticize of something as life or death (survival of the species) encourages sacrifice
        Not what longtermism is or what counts as it, but if it is true
             Introducing longtermism
                A typical social discount rate might be 1% per year, which means that  benefits in 100 years are only worth 36% as much as benefits today, and  benefits in 1000 years are worth almost nothing.
        Discounting
            Discounting as a concept works, but not quantitatively and measurably
            The fundamental trade of immediate certain gain vs. long-term potential immense gains (over compounded)
            Norwegian Sovereign Wealth fund - Set as a mandate to place more emphasis on future generations
        How many animal lives is a human life worth? My most standards, people are uncomfortable with this comparison, but is it somehow more palatable to do this with potential humans because they do not exist?
        Is it inherently good to bring people into existence
            The repugnant conclusion/scenario (Counter of Utilitarianism)―We should bring as many people as possible into existence until the net increase is zero. Quality of life doesn't matter.
            Are we trying to maximize happiness or minimize suffering?
                The utilitarian argument is yes, the other one is no
                Most religions have at a central tenet that life is suffering
                If climate change is inevitable, should we bring more people in if they might not live? -More chance that some people live. If 10% survive, then more likely to keep human existence in place
                    Would you kill Baby Hitler? One person can cause immense suffering, but can also cause immense happiness
            Anti-natalism―Unborn babies / Is it wrong to bring someone into existence if their life is complete suffering
                The paradox of utilitarianism is why should we have the authority to prevent suffering when suffering is in fact subjective, and we are incapable of measuring the potential suffering an organism will endure. Whereas the measurement of happiness does not need to be exact in order for it to be worth it
