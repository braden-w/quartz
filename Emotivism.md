# Emotivism
Moral judgments do not function as statements of fact but rather as expressions of the speaker's or writer's feelings.

## Questions This Raises
Dumb things make me happy, but can they be morally acceptable?
Is there really not objectively wrong with murder?

See [[Moral Dumbfounding]] and [[Signaling]].
