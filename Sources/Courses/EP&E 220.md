## Classic Models of Politics
[[The Prisoner's Dilemma]]
[[Stag Hunt]]
[[The Battle of the Sexes]]
[[Game of Chicken]]
[[Matching Pennies]]

## Questions

### [[Stag Hunt]] Vs. [[The Prisoner's Dilemma]]?
>  In [[Stag Hunt]], your answer depends on what you expect others to play. In the Prisoner's Dilemma, you always want to Fink

### What Makes [[Game of Chicken]] Different From [[The Prisoner's Dilemma]]?
> There is no Nash Equilibrium

### What Makes [[Game of Chicken]] Similar to [[The Battle of the Sexes]]?
> It's like a rotated where both sides want to have opposite choices.

## Theory
[[Strategic Game]]
[[Nash Equilibrium]]

- What is [[Matching Pennies]]? What is it an example of?
	- [[Zero-Sum Game]]
	- What is the expected payoff?
		- 0
	- Why do we play mixed/indifferent?
		- We might as well flip a coin
		- Nobody can profitably deviate

	- What is [[Iterated Elimination of Strictly Dominated Strategies]]

## Lecture 4 [[2022-02-09]]
- What is [[Best Responses]]?
	- A list of actions that is at least as good as any other

- How do [[Best Responses]] compare to [[Nash Equilibrium]]?
- What is the Luce Hall Example?
	- An example of multiplicity of options and equilibria, but a focal point
- [[Schelling Effect]]

- What is an [[Action Profile]]?

## Lecture 5 [[2022-02-14]]
- What is [[Rational Choice Approach]]?
	- Decision maker chooses best action according to her preferences
- What makes a game Strategic?
	- Anticipating moves of other players
- How do we model politicians and voters using [[Rational Choice Approach]] and Strategic?
	- Voters are rational ([[Rational Choice Approach]])
	- But politicians are [[Rational Choice Approach]] and Strategic
- How do we notate preferences?
	- I prefer x over y?
		- x > y
	- I prefer y over x?
		- x < y
	- I am indifferent?
		- x < y

### Preferences in Politics
- [[Downs Hotelling Model]]
	- What did Downs simplify in [[Downs Hotelling Model]]?
		- The only thing that matters to agents is winning
	- What was Downs' subtle implication in the [[Downs Hotelling Model]]?
		- You don't enter politics because you believe in policies, you just want to win
- What was Kenneth Waltz's interpretation of [[State]]s?
	- States are unitary actors who seek, at a minimum, their own preservation and, at maximum, universal domination
- What did Stokes call [[Valence Issues]]? What is an example?
	- Issues where all voters agree on, like getting more competent candidates

## Collective Action
- How are Measles Outbreak and vaccines an example of a Collective Action problem?
- [[Collective Action Problem Table]]

| \   | Yes           | No                    |
| --- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Yes | Private Goods | Common Pool Resources |
| No  | Club Goods    | Public Goods          |

## Lecture From [[2022-02-23 Chatting About Apps with Friends]]
[[John Hopkins Students Collectively Bargain for an A]]

What is [[Tragedy of the Commons]]?

## Lecture on [[2022-03-02]]
- How is Protesting a [[Collective Action]] Problem?
	- How does Protesting have the [[Freeriding]] problem?
	-
- Challenges of Protest?
	- Not knowing if I am the kth individual necessary to break the threshold
- What are examples of protests models and thresholds?

### Model 1
|         | Protest  | Not   |
| ------- | -------- | ----- |
| Protest | b-c, b-c | -c, 0 |
| Not     | 0, -c    | 0,0   |

### Model 2
|         | K-2 or Fewer | K-1 | K or More |
| ------- | ------------ | --- | --------- |
| Protest | -c           | b-c | b-c       |
| Not     | 0            | 0   | b         |

### Model 3
A = {0, 10, 30, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 100}

B = {0, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20 100}

- Many people are discontent but just do not know. In B, even a small change in one person (like a 20 threshold turning to 10) would lead to a massive revolutiongg

## Lecture on [[2022-03-07 Intro Fellowship]]
Why shouldn't you vote?
	Your chance is from 1 in 1 trillion to 1 in 1 million in deciding the election

- How does [[Bribe-Taking and Bribe-Giving]] Incentivizes Bribing?
	- You don't want to report for fear of incriminating yourself
- What's the solution?
	- Legalize [[Harassment Bribes]], and the resulting sequential results help resolve
	- Giving bribes is legal but taking is not

[[Extensive Form Games]] and [[Subgame Perfect Equilibrium]]

[[Ultimatum Game]]
[[Condorcet's Jury Theorem]]
[[Electoral Accountability]]
[[Retrospective Voting]]
