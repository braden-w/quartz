# The Rapid Evolution of the Eye
- A pessimistic estimate of the time required for an eye to evolve
- The layers of the eye was simulated and then left to evolve in conditions

## Findings
- Eyes kept on evolving
- The entire sequence took only about 400,000 generations, which is super short
- Vertebrate eyes evolved some 40-60 times independently from each other

- When there is a strong enough need, it follows
