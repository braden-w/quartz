# fMRI - Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
- Safe
- Noninvasive
- Repeated and extended use
- No special preparation
- Great resolution

Does not measure brain activity, but [[Blood flow in the brain]]

# How it Works
1. Spin (angular momentum of [[Protons|proton]])
2. Magnetic part
	- In a magnetic field, the axis of spinning [[Protons|protons]] align themselves based on field of [[fMRI - Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging|fMRI]]
3. RF Pulses (the resonance part)
	- A pulse upsets the [[Protons|protons]] that were aligned based on field of [[fMRI - Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging|fMRI]]
4. Blood flow
	- For any neuron
		- Increased activity → Sudden oxygen depletion → Over replenished a few seconds later
5. Blood and magnetism
	- Iron in blood is magnetic
	- Without oxygen to shield it, hemoglobin becomes [[paramagnetic]] and takes on magnetic properties of field
	- Inrushing blood increase oxygenation, making blood [[diamagnetic]] and less susceptible to magnetic fields
6. Measurement → When you use a brain, increased blood flow
	1. **More** oxygen and hemoglobin
	2. **Less** susceptibility to magnetic field
	3. **Slower** proton precession back to normal
	4. **Longer** precession period
	5. **Stronger** field signal!

## Studies
- How long does it take to perceive color?
- Morality and [[Emotions are involved in ethical dilemmas]]
- [[Adding static noise to plain images, having participants discern]]

## Questions for fMRI That it Can Solve
How do we do X?
What are the brain areas involved in X?
What functions do brain area Y serve?

## Concerns
1. fMRI has changed (vs. answered) key questions
2. fMRI describes better than it explains
3. (fMRI predicts better than it explains)
4. [[We don’t really know yet what “activation” means]]
5. It’s hard to extrapolate from initial progress
6. fMRI misleads us about explanatory depth
- We fall for Neuro babble
