# Modularity - More Like Magic

## Defining Modularity
You know only input and output, not how it works

1. [[Encapsulation|Information Encapsulation]]
2. [[Lack of access to 'interlevels']]

## Why Modularity
- Ubiquity of specialization (you usually can be really good at one thing, but not both) - At the molecular level - Hemoglobin transports oxygen - Rhodopsin tranduces light to electricty - Anatomical Level - Heart pumps blood - Liver detoxifies poisons - The question - Does this work on the behavioral level?

[[The shepherd's paradox]]

# Symptoms
1. **[[Fast processing]]**
2. **[[Characteristic breakdown]]**
3. **[[Domain Specificity]]**
4. **[[Encapsulation]]**

## Examples
- [[Face recognition from a cognitive perspective]]
- You can recognize people without eyes but with eyebrows better than vice versa
- The human face slowly morphs into a really inhuman version
- We have hidden subtle things that allow us to perceive faces
- [[Prosopagnosics]]
- [[Superrecognizers]]
- Newly hatched chicks
- Dean Chung and Golden Gate bridge
