# Nature Vs. Nurture
- It is the Worse-than-Useless Question
- [[Innateness|Innate]] structure is designed to learn!
  - Like language acquisition.
	  - You innately expect there to be nouns and verbs, in the same way that [[The bees innately have a notion of the sun, and that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, and know the path of the sun in the sky]]
