# Grandmother Cells
Proposal: There is a SINGLE cell, that responds particularly to some visual input of your grandmother.

Would fire immediately after visual input, unlike [[Jennifer Aniston Cells]].

## Do Not Exist
The existence of such grandmother cells have yet to be proven. They do not seem to exist.

## Cells Fire Together, Not Individually
Although you have specific visual cells that spike to seeing color, or to an orientation (some degree of tilt), or some location in your visual field, you DO NOT have one that will spike particularly to seeing your grandmother.

However… as Brian mentioned in class, although we do not have such visual cells, we do have *conceptual* cells. A close read of this paper will help clarify things
