title: Poverty of the stimulus arguments

# Poverty of the Stimulus Arguments
- We can't learn enough just observing from the ground up; instead we start from the top and move down, removing certain qualities
- It's possible that adding stimulus desensitizes us to them rather than makes us more sensitive to them

## [[Preferential Looking]]
- There's not enough stimulus to explain the preference of regular faces over scrambled faces

## Experiments
- [[Visual Paired-Comparisons]]
- [[Monkeys Deprived of Faces]]

## Regarding Language
We are born able to discern all sounds, but they are [[Pruning|pruned]] away

## Regarding Learning
[[Learning plays the role of Pruningpruning away abilities of human nature, rather than adding them]]
- [[Whatever's responsible for visual illusions are innate to human nature or genetic endowment]]

## Regarding Sight
- [[The universal assumption of light source of top]]
	- This is wired into many animals
	- Examples
		- [[The 2 by 3 matrix of dimples and pop outs]]
		- Flipping pictures of asteroid craters gives completely different results because we still think the light source is on the top
		- [[Countershading as animal counterflage]]
