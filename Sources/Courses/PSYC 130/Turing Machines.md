# Turing Machines
You can create complex things from simple machines ^fdda1a

- A tape divided into squares, each with a 0, 1, or nothing
- A scanner that can read and write values
- Instruction table | Given a square, can 1. replace square's value, 2. move L or R, and 3. go to new state.

## Significance
You can create a machine that simulates other machines
It is the first generalized machine
