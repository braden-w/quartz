title: Language = Thoughts
---

# Language = Thoughts
- Thoughts = subvocal speech
- We use language while thinking
- We cannot think without language
- Language is the sole medium of thought

## Why Language != Thoughts
1. We can understand concepts that are not lexicalized
	- If language is necessary for thought, new words could not be coined, but they are
2. We can understand ambiguous meanings
	- If language is the sole medium of thoughts, there should be a 1-to-1 mapping, but there isn't
		- Sentences with ambiguous meanings
		- "I love ambiguity more than both people"
		- Sherlock saw the man using binoculars
3. We can perform mental operations based on non-linguistic imagery
	1. German Shepherd
	2. Handsome Dan
	3. We can visualize them with minimal language
