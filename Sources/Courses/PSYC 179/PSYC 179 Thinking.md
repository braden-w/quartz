# PSYC 179 Thinking
What is [[Priming]]?

## Anchoring
- [[Anchoring and adjustment]]

## Rationality
- Demonstrations of Irrationality
- Arguments for Rationality despite [[Demonstrations of Irrationality]]
	- Misinterpretation of tasks→People are not irrational. They just misunderstood the tasks
		- example: [[Conjunction fallacy]]
			- ![[Pasted image 20211101091927.png]]
	- Bounded Rationality
		- In decision making, rationality of individuals is limited by the information they have, the cognitive limitations of their minds, and the finite amount of time they have to make a decision
		- example→there's not enough time to consider all the results of a chess game $(10^{120})$
		- conclusion→Perfect rationality is irrational
		- Utility maximization or perfect consistency are not feasible in real-life. Trying to do so is {{not}} the most rational action
		- Satisficing↔Instead of an exhaustive search, an agent searches through alternatives until an acceptable threshold is met
		- ![](local:///Users/braden/remnote/Braden_W/files/iGvJbckwQzrNTWXUOAzSasndwFIcW1JG1fPcZ3VRLkALr0H5wK1qWMeoOwmbbyD172U7sIpDQjn4tiPguVpiM99BBfPlT2QpoQORtm2q7XlEFSOR3vWKDktIfZKDMt0f.png)
	- Heuristics are adaptive
		- Evolutionary reasons for having these heurstics
		- We have them because they are useful
		- Reasoning errors are like visual illusion
			- The problem of perception→2-D retina for a 3-D world
			- Solution→We use heuristics to correct
				- Linear perspective→A type of monocular cue in which parallel lines appear to converge at some point. Leads to visual illusions
					- ![](local:///Users/braden/remnote/Braden_W/files/0KYl5SJNX8f0EC0-kExRGD1yIgSSZAY9Pk1H4375nEELXJd0mWs2_o6zhytMKGe46u8_spoJht08HTz89DdpKh5XVLHCVEOwZx0wnoaF4TwmtQQqWW5szSobxacoq2Pi.png)
		- Why we have [Representativeness heuristic](file:///Applications/RemNote.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/build/doc/kN849sc9aAG8PZE8X)
			- Allow us to do pattern recognition, categorization, etc.
			- Similarity works most of the time, and it's costly to **not** use this
			- But sometimes leads to irrational judgements
		- Why we have [Availability Heuristic](file:///Applications/RemNote.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/build/doc/Jae2swi6j2D4wrZAQ)
			- Typically, things that are more readily available in one's mind are more frequent ones
			- Example (Wendy's vs. McDonald's)
	- [[System 1 Processing]]
		- [[System 1 Processing]]
		- [[System 2 Processing]]

		- Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)

		- When does System 2 get triggered?
			- When people have both capacity and motivation
				- Morning people have System 2

			- Perceived difficulty of the judgement at hand
				- ![](local:///Users/braden/remnote/Braden_W/files/kJBJsILUD-oFR1uGKkBLbeZEpT4BBVWq9XbAsq7RKyyh3YtaDTn1_8UKRhesb_t9HCkS0Y6QofiIpHrg_Jl15ZB8Q4od8kWxPI886t8SlRsQo048G3uXuckisk3eNhgn.png)

# Language and Thought
1. [[Language = Thoughts]]
	- Not as good
2. [[Sources/Courses/PSYC 179/Linguistic Determinism]]
3. [[Language interacts with thought]]

# Fake News

## Examples
[[The Great Moon Hoax]]
 ![[Pasted image 20211025120552.png]]
![[Pasted image 20211025120621.png]]

## Why We Believe Fake News
1. Bias to believe information is true
	1. We are constantly bombarded with new information every day
	2. One way to manage this is to automatically accept it as true
	3. This is actually adaptive because **truths occur more often than falsehoods**
	4. "Unbelieving takes extra effort"
	- [[Intuitive thinkers are more likely to accept fake news than deliberate thinkers (Trump and Clinton supporters and Fake News)]]
	- [[Fake news is judged to be more accurate when more familiar (repetition effect)]]
2. Repetition of statement increases validity of the statement
3. People often fail to remember the source of their knowledge
	- People don't remember the original time and place of learning most of the facts they know
	- Can be good; save storage for more important information
	- Problem: When acquired through questionable sources
		- [[Laypeople rate mainstream sources as more trustworthy than hyper partisan and fake news]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20211025122443.png]]
	- [[Children can fabricate completely false memory and disturbing stories when under threat or leading questions, or even just asking the same question again]]
4. Illusion of consensus (often all derived from same source)
	1. [[Participants were equally confident in conclusions drawn from true consensus and false consensus (many sources vs. fake many from only one source)]]

How can we prevent it?

1. Merely denying/correcting doesn't work
	![[Pasted image 20211025124837.png]]
2. Provide an alternative fact
	- ![[Pasted image 20211025124837.png]]
3. Innoculation
	1. A strong challenge is weakened to the point where it will not change the person's position, but it will trigger protective responses, like enhanced critical thinking or [[System 2 Processing]]
	2. ![[Pasted image 20211025124948.png]]
4. Instead of merely denying, provide an explanation for why it's not correct

# Inductive and Deductive Reasoning
[[Argument]]

[[Premises]]

[[Deductive Reasoning]] and [[Inductive Reasoning]]
![](https://i.imgur.com/HIUM2In.png)

[[Deductively Invalid, but Inductively Valid Reasoning]]

Types of Deductive Reasoning

1. [[Conditional Syllogism]]
2. [[Categorical Syllogism]]

[[Falsification - It Only Takes One False Case That Disconfirms the Hypothesis]]

[[5 Steps for Determining if Conclusion is Valid]]

[[Real World Example of an Invalid Conditional Syllogism]]

[[Truth Vs. Validity]]

```ad-note
Belief Bias in [[Categorical Syllogism]] Stems From The Fact that [[We Confuse Truth to Be Validity]], and  [[The Believability of the Judgement Affects Our Validity Judgement]]
```

[[Things That Improve Inductive Strength]]

[[Why We May Abandon Law of Large Numbers]]

Things We Can Convince Others with

1. [[False Dichotomy]]
2. [[Straw Person Argument]]
3. [[Circular Reasoning]]
4. [[Arguments Against the Person]]
5. [[Guilt by Association]]
6. [[Appeal to Pity]]
7. [[Appeal to Pride]]

# Problem Solving and Creativity

## Problem Solving
[[Tower of Hanoi]] and [[Problem Space]]

[[Problem Solving]]

Methods in [[Problem Solving]] as a Search

1. [[Random Search]]
2. [[Hill-Climbing Method]]
3. [[Means-End Analysis]]

[[Hill-Climbing Method is Working Forwards, While Means-End Analysis is Working Backwards]]

[[Backwards is better when there are too many choices coming from initial state]]

## Creativity

[[Factors That Prevent Us From Being Creative SolutionCreative]]

[[The Incremental Nature of Creative SolutionCreativity]]

[[We Need Constraints To Be Creative]]

# Concepts and General Essentialism
[[Course Notes/PSYC 179/Concepts]]

Functions of [[Course Notes/PSYC 179/Concepts]]

- Cognitive economy
	- It saves cognitive work
	- Consider chairs, where the category of chairs helps save us work of naming all different type of chairs
- Inductive Inference
	- Go beyond the information given
	- Lion->infer that it's dangerous

Mental representation

A hypothetical internal cognitive symbol representing reality

## [[Classical View]]
[[Singly Necessary]] and [[Jointly Sufficient]]

[[Problems with Classical View]]

## [[Prototype View]]
[[Categorization Based Off Prototype View]]

[[Conceptualization According to the Prototype View]]

[[Prototypes Are Judged as "Old" More Often Than "New"]]

## [[Psychological Essentialism]]
[[Deformed Lemon Example]]

[[Because of Psychological Essentialism, We Have Disgust with Essence]]

[[Problem with Psychological Essentialism Reinforces Stereotypes]]
- [[Category Labels Trigger Psychological Essentialism]]
- [[Genetic Attributions to Race Don't Make Sense]]
- [[Greater Genetic Essentialism is Linked to Racism]]

[[Negative Effect of Using "am" Rather Than "have"]]

[[Women's Response to Stereotype Threat Was Better When Attributed to Environment, Not Genetics ]]

[[The More People Attributed Depression to Genetics, the Longer it Lasted]]

But there is possibles
