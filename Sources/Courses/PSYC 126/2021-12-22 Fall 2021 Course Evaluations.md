# [[2021-12-22]] Fall 2021 Course Evaluations

## [[Sources/Courses/PSYC 126/PSYC 126 Attraction and Relationships]]
Exploring and understanding various topics in the realm of relationships and how we enter them. Some things that stuck out were Attachment Theory, how greater context shapes relationship dynamics (such as socioeconomic status), communication, and what effective support looks like.

Strengths: Very flexible format and extremely well organized—the lecture and notes are detailed, and the exams relaxing. Hirsch really cares about her students and giving us options—we also had the option to watch recordings, a free late day for written assignments, and taking the final virtually due to COVID circumstances. Writing assignments every other week were also relaxed and fun!

_(Your anonymous response to this question may be viewed by Yale College students, faculty, and advisers to aid in course selection and evaluating teaching.)_
**A** low

**3.** What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?

_(Your anonymous response to this question may be viewed by Yale College students, faculty, and advisers to aid in course selection and evaluating teaching.)_
**A** Strengths: Amazing sense of humor from Scholl, lectures are fun. Weaknesses: Course is disorganized and grading in exams is all-or-nothing (basically no partial credit on short answers, and you don't get points unless you say exact words or phrases). So if you are unlucky (like me), you might get your lowest grade ever in the midterm.

_(Your anonymous response to this question may be viewed by Yale College students, faculty, and advisers to aid in course selection and evaluating teaching.)_
**A** Not unless you have to or Credit D Fail. Even after this class, I cannot explain to a student "What did I learn?" due to the disorganized nature of curriculum. The grading in midterms and finals are all-or-nothing, which can lead to brutal unsalvagable grade situations.

**10.** Summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the instructor. In what ways was their teaching effective and in what ways could their teaching be improved?

_(Your anonymous response to this question may be viewed only by your instructor(s) and administrators responsible for evaluating teaching.)_
