# Rationalist Explanation of War
[[War]]

In his article, Fearon examines various explanations for war: people are irrational, leaders enjoy the benefits of war and do not suffer the repercussions of it, and rational leaders would still choose fighting in a war as if it were the rational positive-expected-value choice. Even rational agents have opportunities to miscalculate each others' willingness to go to war. Fearon discusses five possible rationalist justifications of war: anarchy, expected benefits are greater than expected costs, rational preventative war, rational miscalculation due to lack of information, and rational miscalculation or disagreement about relative power. The article concludes that it is best to negotiate to figure out the viability of war.
