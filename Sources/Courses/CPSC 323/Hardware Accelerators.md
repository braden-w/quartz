# Hardware Accelerators
Used for accelerating specific applications

## Examples
[[Parts of a computer#GPU Graphics processing unit]], [[Parts of a computer#NIC Network Interface Card]], [[Parts of a computer#ISP Image signal processor]]

## Why Do We Need Them?
- Main goal: maximize performance/watt
- Power is low, performance should be high
- Safety Protocols: majority have tiny cpu ("wimpy CPU") that monitors the device and shuts down or down clock the device if it starts to overheat
