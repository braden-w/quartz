# Reading Easter Island
Shepsle: The article defines various terms such as private goods, public supply, externalities, and tragedy of the commons. Private goods are excludable, in comparison to public goods which are not. The article also discusses when it would be a good idea for the government to provide certain goods (such as roads, etc.), and discusses externalities and how government can use taxes or subsidies to control them.

Diamond: The reading explores the mystery of Easter Island, where enormous statues were carved in spite of the island seemingly having minimal resources. It explores the many statues of various sizes, and possibly growing in size, as a result of competition. Unfortunately, in part from European influence, the island experienced an enormous decline in resources and population. Easter island eventually reached extreme deforestation that led to its society collapsing, a coup, starvation, and cannibalism, and the collective action problems and presence of free riding added to this effect.
