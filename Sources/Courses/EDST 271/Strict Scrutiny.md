# Strict Scrutiny

## Context
From: The 14th Amendment of the [[Constitution]]

After: The Civil War, states trying to prevent black people from traveling and getting rights

- What is it also known as?
	- The toughest test a law can be given
- Legal protection from laws that might discriminate
- Laws rarely pass strict scrutiny

- Laws that prevent interstate travel, voting, free speech, restrict practice of religion, restrict access to courts, etc. are subject to Strict Scrutiny

You cannot be denied

- What example groups are given benefits from Strict Scrutiny?
>	Religion
>	Race
>	National Origin
>	Veganism
- What example groups are given intermediate benefits from Strict Scrutiny?
> Gender
> Sex
> Birth
> LGBTQ+
- What example groups have no benefits and are not suspect classes?
> 	Age
> 	Disability
> 	Class
> 	You can discriminate by eye color, wealth, etc.

## How to Pass
- What is the two-prong test?
	- Deep compelling state interest that a state must take
	- The law must be narrowly tailored/least restrictive means possible
- The judge will look at if you could have targeted a different narrower part of the population while minimizing discrimination
- It needs to be extremely well taylored

## Intermediate Scrutiny
- Classification based on gender and illegitimacy (born to an unmarried mother)

## Intent
If you write a law, and it's very racist, if it's not intended, it's still constitutional

## Heightened Vs. Intermediate Scrutiny
Heightened?

>Affirmative Action

Intermediate?

> Gender Based Admissions

What is the issue?

> Affirmative Action cannot be narrowly tailored to fit any subgroup
> The Supreme Court has said that having schools that are diverse and representative of the country is compelling state interest
