# Jus Ad Bellum
[[War]]

Govern conflict initiation

1. Right authority– Only a nation’s legitimate leader may declare war.
2. Just cause– A nation should only enter into war to protect its citizens or to right an injustice.
3. Proportionality– A nation should only use as much force as necessary to achieve its objectives.
4. Last resort– A nation should only go to war after all other options have been exhausted.
