# Panpsychism
[[Philosophy]]

- What is the general gist?
	- Instead of starting from matter and deducing [[consciousness]], start with [[consciousness]] and get matter from it
- Everything, from electrons to quarks, have what property?
- Physics tells us what matter does, but [[Consciousness]] tells us what matter is
