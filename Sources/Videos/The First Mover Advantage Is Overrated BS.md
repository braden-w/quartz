# The First Mover Advantage Is Overrated BS
[[First Mover Advantage]] is BS

- Even worse than being too late is too early
	- Google and Facebook were both not first moversâ€”there were way more existing products
	- Billionaires wanted satellite internet before SpaceX, but timing was too early
	- Networking computer was thought by Oracle, but market wasn't ready with Internet Connections (now it's Google Chromebook)
- You can avoid mistakes of others

```ad-note
It's way better to be a successor than pioneer
