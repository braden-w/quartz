# 2022-08-08 Letter to Professor Sexton and Postl Asking for Readings and an Extension

## 2 Requests: Final Paper Readings and Deadline
Dear Professor Postle,

Today, I completed one of the last homework assignments of Machine Learning Safety Scholars, an online fellowship with ML researcher Dan Hendrycks.

Unfortunately, the final exam, which will holistically assess all three courses of the program, is slated to occur on August 12, the day that our final essays is due.

**1. Request for Readings**

I was wondering if you had the link to Johnny Yarker's PhD thesis, and if there were any other particular resources that would be helpful in understanding the evolution and interpretations of copying art.

With the bulk of my machine learning homework completed, I have only been able to begin my research today, and am hoping to rapidly make progress.

**2. Request for Potential of Extension**

With this in mind, I would like to request an extension on my final paper, if possible. An extension as little as two days to August 14 would be more than sufficient, as this would allow me to travel home and still have an extra day after the deadline to spend on the essay. It also avoids having all three finals (BRST 158, BRST 214, and MLSS) converge on August 12.

I apologize for the short notice, and should my deadline remain Friday, I will do my best to turn my paper in on time. However, extending the deadline would allow me to invest more time in the essay and be greatly appreciated. My sincerest thanks for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Braden Wong

We mentioned an extension earlier today classâ€”I just wanted to express that given my situation, I have a particularly vested interest in seeing them happen. Should my deadline remain Friday, I will do my best to turn my paper in on time. However, extending the deadline would allow me to invest more time in the essay and be greatly appreciated. My sincerest thanks for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Braden Wong
