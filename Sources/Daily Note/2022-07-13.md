of course of course haha

he made a series of basic lifestyle improvements such as eating a healthier diet with more veggies, less carbs and meat, switched to olive oil instead of canola, and added pineapple juice to his lunch (all that stuff made his stuff really tasty but didnt affect the volume in a noticeable way)

i think the hugest increase in volume was when he started eating a lot of celery. within a week of that specific change his loads easily tripled in volume

he ate two or three stalks with almost every snack when he got the munchies while we were high and had it with his lunch everyday and sometimes even had a couple sticks of it with dinner

he doesnt keep up that level of intake all the time so we dont often have the gooping problem xD
