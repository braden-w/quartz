# 2022-07-24 Amazing Talk with Joe and Giuliana
Truly an amazing talk about our views of the world and our upbringings. We talked about so many different things
- Choking as a sign of expressing trust in intimacy
- Our upbringings
	- My upbringing as an Asian American
		- Feeling typecasted
		- Satellite Babies versus FOBs versus ABCs
	- Joe growing up closeted Republican and accepted in his closeted form
	- Giuliana
		- Culturally Brazillian, but is in more solidarity with America
		- Phillipinos are actually very similar to Spaniards
		- Spanish accents
- [[Doors]] and their effect of what is possible in a conversation
	- Fuck Inclusion
		- Misappropriate cultures and general unease of professors who teach ethnic studies
		- Maybe we do have the right to [[Gatekeep]] our culture
