# Why EAs Are Skeptical About AI Safety - EA Forum
I found this section on why [[EA might not be the best platform for AI safety research]] particularly salient:

> One of my criticisms of the EA movement is that I’m not sure it’s the best platform for promoting investment in AI research. When you have a charitable movement and then you have people who are active in AI research saying that we need to put mounds of money into AI research, which happens to be a field that gives them their jobs and benefits them personally, then many people are going to become very suspicious of this. Is this just an attempt for all of these people to defraud us so they can live large?. This is one of the reasons why I have been suspicious about the EA movement.

And this part:

> People who don’t benefit from AI research makes me more positive about the EA movement… this would be a point why the AI research thing should be discussed on many other platforms, chiefly on the political and scientific fields, but the EA community may not be the best platform for this topic.

## Matt's Summary
If I could distill this argument it’s something like this:

1. Some individuals claim that AGI could kill us all
2. These AI researchers are incentivized to make doomsaying claims because:
	1. It gives AI researchs meaning to work on a problem that fits their particular niche (it’s a technically interesting problem)
	2. It absolves them of any duty to work on problems like global poverty (which aren’t very appealing to work on for the prototypical AI researcher)
	3. It gives them money (Charitable organizations like OpenPhilanthropy direct money to individuals working on AI safety research)
3. Intuitively, it doesn’t seem likely that AI is going to kill us all
4. It’s more likely that the individuals claiming that AI is dangerous are either:
	1. don’t actually know what’s going on [wrong and not using motivated reasoning]
	2. fooling themselves into believing AI is an existential risk [wrong and using motivated reasoning]
	3. knowingly deceiving others to benefit themselves.
