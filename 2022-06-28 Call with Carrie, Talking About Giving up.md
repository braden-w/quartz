# [[2022-06-28]] Call with Carrie, Talking About Giving up
Giving up
If you accept a situation, don't be unhappy
A lot of arguments are over definitions
BMWing instead of Giving Up
Functional Fixedness
Glad we cleared this up
When I criticize, Carrie gaslights herself and I end up comforting her
She is taking responsibility for it
Don't be sorry. Do better

If there were two versions, I would prefer the second one
But this isn't to compare you with the other version. This is to accept you for who you are

People who want the strongest form of empathy, get attracted to seeing partner or empathizer suffer
- It's A Relief And Reassuring To See a Normal Person also break down when they realize what we've been through

Evolution

- Carrie crying as a way to validate or confirm that she understands what she is saying

In which way is it most obvious I am a novice?
I am not jealous

Jealousy and evolution
I have ascended over jealousy
Homo Maximus
