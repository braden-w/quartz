# [[2021-02-15]] Primates and Philosophers

## Framework
Utilitarian, weak ethical hedonist**s**

A weak determinism exists based on the probabilistic nature of the universe.

## Questions

### Socially
- How to connect with people you haven’t in a long time?
- How do you find out if someone is someone you can vibe with?
- What constitutes a worthwhile relationship to keep, past and present?

Is it worse or equal to misinterpret an idea differently from the author?

Dumb and fascinated or omniscient?

What if we could hold onto every learned experience or idea we’ve once had but forgotten? What would be different about us now?

Does the presence of a leader to take absolute ownership, such as the Milgram experiment, nullify the ownership of committing evil

## Hot Takes

- socially, very few people defy expectations in a positive and enriching way
- worse is better
- the key to getting more done is wasting time productively
- you can appreciate a topic matter without actively investing in it
