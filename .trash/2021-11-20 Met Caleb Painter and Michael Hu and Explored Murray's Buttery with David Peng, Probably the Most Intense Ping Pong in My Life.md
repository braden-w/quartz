# [[2021-11-20]] Met [[Caleb Painter]] and [[Michael Hu]] and Explored Murray's Buttery with [[David Peng]], Probably the Most Intense Ping Pong in My Life



[[Caleb Painter|Caleb]] and I both played Tennis, so we went HARD. We played, and I won the first two, then we rallied. We rallied so intensely that there was a point where if the ping pong went over a foot in the air, we would instantly smash it. [[David Peng|David]] and [[Michael Hu|Michael]] watched intently and enjoyed it very much.

Afterwards, we were drenched and drank water together, then played one more game which I lost. We were all very content with how we performed and thanked each other.

Then, we played a game of Pool together. I started out ahead, but quickly fell into last place. However, I pulled a comeback quickly and was able to clutch the win!! The last shot was an absolute banger, which went slightly around a ball and knocked the 8 ball into the corner pocket.
