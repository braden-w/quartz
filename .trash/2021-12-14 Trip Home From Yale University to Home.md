# [[2021-12-14]] Trip Home From [[Yale University]] to Home



[[2021-12-14 Flying with Unlimited Snacks and Drinks and the Fridge Wide Open. It Was so Great!]]

[[2021-12-14 They Moved Me to an Aisle Seat Two Rows Away From the Fridge, so I Made Sure to Make the Most of It!]]

[[Along the Way Home, I Texted Carrie About Educational Studies Certificate and Course Choices, David and Kai About CS Pset, and Yvonne and Peter About Returning Home.]]
