# [[2021-10-31]] Communist manifesto, watching the YSO Halloween Show, free buttery food, hanging out with suitemates in common room and reading Librex



## Communist manifsto

Picked up a free communist manifesto right before the YSO Halloween show.

## YSO Halloween show

Sat with Justin and watched the show. It was so funny!

First, we listened to Low Strung as they played a bunch of songs. They played Hotel California and Living on a Prayer. The guy on Living on a Prayer was so hype!! He was playing so high on the fingerboard and it was super duper impressive.

Afterwards, the YSO started rolling in section by section, as we cheered and had a great time. They played some intro cinematic music (including the THX and 20th Century Fox music), and then there was a super cinematic movie.

The movie and background music was sooo good! The premise was that there was King Arther and the Holy Ale, where drinking from the Ale gave you a 4.0 GPA. There were so many callout jokes! I laughed so hard with the rest of the group. It was cinematic and well-written. I especially enjoyed the joke about [[Sex in Stacks]], which was so hilarious, and the victory music, when they played Industry Baby.

I walked out with Kevin Yang and chatted with him and Inseo. Kevin and I were twinning with the green jacket which was hilarious!!

## Buttery

Afterwards, I saw [[Bilal]] in the buttery. I asked for some cookie dough right after Isabella had turned off the terminal and asked everyone if anyone wanted to buy anything, so she just ended up giving it to me for free since she was too tired! Afterwards, there were a bunch of extra nuggets and mozzarella sticks that they were tentatively going to throw away since nobody wanted any, so I offered to take them since our suite has 9 people. They said yes!

[[Bilal]] and I giddily went up the stairs to our suite and shared the mozzarella sticks and nuggets with Sonny and David. It was a great time!!

We talked and then observed the Librex situation. [[Bilal]] posted HILARIOUS memes on a Sombrero with the Pope labeled # CancelThePope and another meme, ![](https://i.imgur.com/6R0X5kp.png)
