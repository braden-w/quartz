# [[2021-11-22]] Eating Dinner with Path, Kai, Wyatt, Ananya



Exchanged travel plans and how Iâ€™m traveling with my friends to Boston to ask Harvard Friends and strike while the iron is hot from [[2021-11-20 Harvard Yale Game]]

We talked about how [[Math and CS Kids are the same, except CS Kids can't keep still and always need to tweak something]].

Otherwise, it was a great time!
