# [[2021-12-12]] Haven Hot Chicken with Carrie



Had some delicious Haven Hot Chicken after [[Bilal]] and Rayyan did a run for us. They picked us up one tender in Haven Hot, which Carrie and I shared. It was hotter than expected! I think we weren’t acclimated having been on Yale Dining for so long. However, I’m so grateful that Carrie has great spice tolerance!
