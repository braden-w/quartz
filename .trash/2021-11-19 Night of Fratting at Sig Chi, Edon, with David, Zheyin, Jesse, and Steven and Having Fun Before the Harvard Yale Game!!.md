# [[2021-11-19]] Night of Fratting at Sig Chi, Edon, with David, Zheyin, Jesse, and Steven and Having Fun Before the Harvard Yale Game!!



## Fratting at Sig Chi.

Was pleasantly surprised by the vibes and the beautiful fairy lights strung over!

[[How I almost didn't go to Sig Chi the first time]]

We then attempted to go to APhi, but they got shut down before we could. Walking down the streets around High Street, however, with everyone around us bustline was a blast!

## Fratting at Edon.

Beautiful fairy lights, and saw a bunch of friends! We crawled in through a hatch and then danced with Bilal and David on the dance floor. Saw Elven, and didn't know he smoked! He also was with Amy, which was an interesting sight. On our way to the top to put away our jackets, we saw Ryan, but he looked super spaced out. We figured he was on LSD.

Shared our Google Photos with everyone!!

On my way back to Hopper, I called Grandpa and then Dad. Wasn't able to meet Sierra but it was great to catch up with family!!

On the way back, I saw Zach in the [[No-Sex Room]] on top of someone!

Finally, I [[Staying the Night with Carrie|stayed the night with Carrie]].
