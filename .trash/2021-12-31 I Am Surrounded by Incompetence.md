# [[2021-12-31]] I Am Surrounded by Incompetence



In reflection of [[2021-12-31 Helping Bryce and Peter with Their Essays, Realized That Bryce Had Put the Wrong Activities and Didn't Even Put Boy Scouts]]

Tommy Init realizing he had a college essay due the next day.

I am dejected that my brother had not put Boy Scouts or Speech and Debate in his application. I will, however, make the most of this and prevail in the end.

I am so grateful that I talked to this with Carrie [[2021-12-31 Called Carrie Before New Year, Venting About Bryce, and Wishing a Happy New Year]]. It has helped me cool off and not bring it up to Mom and Dad, lest it cause them unnecessary stress.
