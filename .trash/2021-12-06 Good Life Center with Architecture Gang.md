# [[2021-12-06]] Good Life Center with Architecture Gang



The Good Life Center was so pretty!! It was gorgeous with a green wall. We joked that it looked like a wedding.

We took pictures with the [[Architecture Gang]] sitting around a table.

Carrie asked, can you take a picture with Braden and me? We then took pictures against the green background and the hallway. I just felt so wholesome the entire time.
