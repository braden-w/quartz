# [[2021-12-30]] Eating Dinner with Carrie and [[Carrie's Church Friends]], Learning Mahjong, Carrie Teaching Me Speed and Big Two



- First, we drove back home together and sat down togther. Carrie cooked herself some noodles, which I ate with her
- Read my Christmas Card [[2021-12-19 Letter to Carrie]] and clarified stuff. It was so nice!
- Grabbed food from [[Sung Nong Dan]]. It was so delicious and tender!! - [[Imagine Living in Midwest with a California Salary. That's Like Playing Minecraft on Creative Mode]]
- Learned Mahjong
- Eating Starbucks bar with her friends, watching a very amusing game of Catan where Eric dominated!
- Met Carrie's Dad

## Message Afterwards

Carrie could you let me know when youâ€™re home safe! And please if your parents need an explanation I can help explain ðŸ¤¡

Thank you for today ðŸ˜Š I really enjoyed watching you cook and eating with you, eating dinner with your church friends. Thank you for showing me pics of Hawaii, the old house, you and your sister! And playing speed and big two with me, and driving me, and everything else in between ahah

Bryce is at full capacity now! Heâ€™s calling his friends and not feeling bad at all

MY GOODNESS and my bad about not recognizing the Hawaii souvenirsâ€”that is completely on me and I should have remembered to check with my parents after we had dinner that night to see it
