# [[2021-12-19]] Talked with Carrie and Reflected on Mammoth and Our Time in HQ

 

Carrie felt guilt for us if we were to pay for transportation and housing, which reminded me of [[Unlike Most Couples, Carrie and I Have an Issue of Guilt Rather Than Resentment]].

We also remarked about the time we hung out in [[Humanities Quadrangle|HQ]], and how it was great that I texted her about making sure she wasn't uncomfortable.
