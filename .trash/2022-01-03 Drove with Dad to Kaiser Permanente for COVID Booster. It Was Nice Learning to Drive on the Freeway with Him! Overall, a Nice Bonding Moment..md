# [[2022-01-03]] Drove with [[Dad]] to Kaiser Permanente for COVID Booster. It Was Nice Learning to Drive on the Freeway with Him! Overall, a Nice Bonding Moment.



During which, I assured him that the [[Stay Away From Braden to Save Your Back]] was really funny and I enjoyed it , just didn't know how to react back then.
