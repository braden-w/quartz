# [[2021-10-29]] Fall Fest in Hopper. Absolutely great time!




Setup was involved: I met Selema at 12PM, and then helped move a lot of our baskets of apples, cider, etc. to the outside. Met Head Adams and Hans, and she remarked that I have been doing so much and been really active. I felt so appreciated!

[[Angad]] made a pumpkin head and was so nice in asking me how I could help. He carved out the guts of a pumpkin and put it on his head! It was so funny.

Otherwise, the work with Bob our photographer was great. He took photos in the photo booth and candids as well, which was great for helping us since Wei Ting was out.

Carved pumpkins with Nathan, saw Justin with his new "best first year friends".

[[Bilal]] said that the warm cider was so good (11/10), and afterwards, Kate and Tai cleaned up with me and thanked me for a job well done.

Overall, my hard work has paid off. I am so grateful to have had this opportunity!!
