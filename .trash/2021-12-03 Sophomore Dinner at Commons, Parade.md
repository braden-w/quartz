# [[2021-12-03]] Sophomore Dinner at Commons, Parade



While preparing for the event with Rayyan, decided to put on my Gray Suit. David decided to stay behind, due to COVID concerns.

## Food

It was so opulent!! There was sushi, dumplings, seafood and creamy pasta, lemon meringue, chocolate muffins, big ice sculptures, and more.

## Carrie

Carrie was absolutely beautiful. She wore a white dress, and was absolutely stunning. Talking with her, and the [[Buttery Book Boys]], made my day.

## Parade

The parade was a marvel. I was slightly upset to see how wasteful it was. Afterwards, people were walking around with a bunch of food (crabs, lobsters, turkey legs, etc.).

## Turkey Leg

Ate a Turkey Leg with [[Sonny]] and took pictures together. It was so hype to eat such an enormous Turkey Leg with him and Carrie.

## [[I Don't Know Why]] Played

[[I Don't Know Why]] played, and I was so excited! Messaged Mai to let her know what was up, and we shared a hype moment.

## Conclusion

Afterwards, I got David and Selina hella food in to-go boxes.

I proceeded to join the [[Architecture Gang]] in [[2021-12-06 Good Life Center with Architecture Gang]].
