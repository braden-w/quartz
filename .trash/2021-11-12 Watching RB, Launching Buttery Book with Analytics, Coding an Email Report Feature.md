# [[2021-11-12]] Watching RB, Launching Buttery Book with Analytics, Coding an Email Report Feature

 

There was a HYPE dance with Jordan with Red background, and Katie and Emily's choreo was so high energy! The production value with the background was so great.

In the meantime, we launched the [[Yale Buttery Book]] with Google Analytics. I was watching the graphs grow during the show after we sent out the email and was floored!! We peaked at 981 concurrent users which was CRAZY. So proud of the team and what we were able to accomplish.

Afterwards, I coded an email report feature so email tickets are created!! It is a great time.
