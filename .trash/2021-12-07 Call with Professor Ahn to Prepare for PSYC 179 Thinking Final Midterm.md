# [[2021-12-07]] Call with Professor Ahn to Prepare for [[PSYC 179 Thinking]] Final Midterm



Asked some great questions, talked about how we can use utilitarianism in the [[Self Driving Car Problem]]. Problems might be that the population's share of different beliefs will change over time.

Otherwise, thank you for tips and I am doing better now on my most recent midterms, [[regression to mean]].
