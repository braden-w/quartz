# [[2021-11-02]] NIP Vs. Copenhagen Flames
CRAZY comeback on Inferno from NIP.

The casters went crazy so many times. There was one spraydown in Inferno where they had back turns and mowed down three. Several deagle plays on

Machine was such a great caster with SpunJ.

Another crazy comeback from 14-7 on Ancient. CPH did so many retakes on CT side on B site and kept on making it work! It was crazy. Back to back retakes over and overagain.
