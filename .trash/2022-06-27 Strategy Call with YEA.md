# [[2022-06-27]] Strategy Call with YEA
- If Batman was consequentialist, he would kill the joker
- Consequentialism in Pop Culture
	- There’s always a situation where a lot of people are going to die
- Fun Activity: Pitching a Consequentialist Superhero
- [[Maximus the Utilitarian]]
	- the conflict: Maximus wants to save the most people possible, but DC keeps making Batman movies and Batman keeps making people die
	- tragic backstory: (reverse batman) parents are prison guards killed by Joker in the DC unvierse
	- the resolution: Maximus founds EA, it is revealed that he is actually William MacAskill
- Rule Utilitarianism
- Politics
	- Hopefully the loss of Flynn is humbling, that you cannot just talk about using money to buy people
	- Be So Good They Can’t Ignore You
- Talking about being paid and career conferences
	- Start with Why
	- The reason we go to conferences where
	- Interestingly, we avoid this when talking to our friends
- Failure Mode
- Uneasy about a scandal
	- But other organizations have made failures
- Focus on the principles, not the organization
	- EA doesn’t matter. The principles matter
- Starting YERI
	- What got you here won’t get you there
