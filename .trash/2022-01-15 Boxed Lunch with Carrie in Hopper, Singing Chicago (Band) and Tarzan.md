# [[2022-01-15]] Boxed Lunch with [[Carrie]] in Hopper, Singing [[Chicago (Band)]] and [[Tarzan]]



After [[2022-01-15 Barely Making Dinner with Carrie and Sharing Dinner with People Who Didn't Make Dinner]], we went into my room in Hopper and had a really great time vibing to music!

- Singing Songs from [[Chicago (Band)]]
- You're the Inspiration
- [[Carrie really likes trumpets in Chicago]]

Afterwards, we had a great conversation: [[2022-01-15 Crazy Good Talk with Bilal and Carrie About India, China, Russia, Pins, and More]]
