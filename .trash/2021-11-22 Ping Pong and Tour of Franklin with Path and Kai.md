# [[2021-11-22]] Ping Pong and Tour of Franklin with Path and Kai



After [[2021-11-22 Eating Dinner with Path, Kai, Wyatt, Ananya]], gave Path and Kai a tour with [[Carrie]]'s keycard. It was a blast! They remarked on the space and how awesome Franklin dorms were compared to theirs (automated lights, furniture, etc.).

We also played a lot of ping pong. Kai remarked how I played like a tennis player, and for a while we had a rock paper scissors matchup, where Path->Me->Kai->Path, but I eventually was able to beat both. It was an absolute blast!!
