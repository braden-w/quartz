# [[2021-10-20]] Met Aaron from Google. Explained web development and cloud computing in depth to [[Carolyn]] and made a first great impression unknowingly! Impressive review at the end.



First, I chatted with Carolyn in my suite with a little bit about React and web development

Then, I met [[Aaron from Google]] after staying at Lumisa's and then saying hi to him while talking with Akeel and Lumisa.

Then, [[[[2021-10-20]] Movie at Nathan Wu's suite, watched Spirited Away with [[Dante Motley|Dante]] and Flora. Lots of delicious giant Swedish fish and Chocolate sticks! Brought some in my pocket in addition to Matriculate goodie bags.]]

At the movie, I talked about the Cloud and explained a bunch of stuff to Carolyn. As I did, Aaron seemed to take interest and was asking questions and adding small details.

I asked him if he had anything else to add/was there anything I was missing, and he said no you did a good job!

I asked him this was so cool, was he a software engineer? And he was like no, I am a video editor! But I can get a terabyte of compute in an instant to render and I was like that's awesome and crazy tooling, where do you work?

And he said GOOGLE. I was completely floored.

We then talked about problems and solutions after I told him that I was a humanities major, which intrigued him. He was really impressed with my [[Overengineering and titanium vs. steel bits]] analogy, which was super awesome!

Overall, think I made a great impression and it was so awesome to stumble upon a Google employee.

## Luck

There were so many things that went right for this to happen

- Lucky I had explained the exact same concepts in [[[[2021-10-19]] Dinner with David, Carrie, Jen. Talked a bunch about AI, then taught them how cloud computing, software engineering, and servers work! Taught them the entirety of the web.]].
- Lucky I could have easily met him earlier in [[[[2021-10-20]] Dinner at Silliman with Nathan, Avalon, Emily, Carrie]], but ended up not doing so, which was how I was able to unknowingly give such a strong first impression.
- Lucky I visited Nathan's room
