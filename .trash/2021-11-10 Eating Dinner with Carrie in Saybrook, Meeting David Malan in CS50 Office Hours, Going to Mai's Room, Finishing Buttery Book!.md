# [[2021-11-10]] Eating Dinner with Carrie in Saybrook, Meeting David Malan in [[CS50]] Office Hours, Going to Mai's Room, Finishing Buttery Book!




Ate dinner with Carrie in Saybrook and talked about how busy of a schedule I have coming up.

Went to David Malan and had the courage to go up to him, shake hands, and say how much I was a fan!

Since Office Hours at Hill House were really close to Silliman, I stopped by Mai's. We talked, she gave me kimchi and instant spicy ramen, and we then got some S'mores with Ana in the courtyard. It was a general great vibe!!

Afterwards, I finished [[Yale Buttery Book]] with the boys.
