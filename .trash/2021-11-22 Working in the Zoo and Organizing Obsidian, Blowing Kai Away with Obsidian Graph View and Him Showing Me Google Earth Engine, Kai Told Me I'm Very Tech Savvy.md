# [[2021-11-22]] Working in the Zoo and Organizing [[Obsidian]], Blowing Kai Away with [[Obsidian]] Graph View and Him Showing Me Google Earth Engine, Kai Told Me I'm Very Tech Savvy



Organized [[Obsidian]] according to [[Chris Jereza's 4 Principles, and How Most People Have the Order Wrong]].

Showed Kai my setup with [[Obsidian]] and he was blown away when I showed him the graph view. Also showed him Remnote, and he showed me Google Earth Engine.

Kai told me that I was very tech savvy. Thank
