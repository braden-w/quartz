# [[2021-10-30]] Watched Glee Club Concert with David and his junior friend Tony



- [[2021-10-30 On the way there, ran with Carrie to make it in time. We remarked that we would be great in a 3-legged race, as our steps matched again]]
- Francis Fedora on cello solo.
- Song celebrating 50 years of Co-Ed was super awesome.
- nDrums song was SOOO epic!! There was so much syncopation on the shaker on the left, and the two drummers on the right were absolutely amazing. The one on the right was especially amazing, making so many movements with his hands and almost had his drum fall out which was crazyy
