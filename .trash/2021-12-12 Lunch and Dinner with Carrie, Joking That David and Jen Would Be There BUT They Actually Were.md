# [[2021-12-12]] Lunch and Dinner with Carrie, Joking That David and Jen Would Be There BUT They Actually Were

 

Had brunch with Carrie’s suitemates, talked about the Amtrak, [[Boston]] versus [[New York]], and more!

Had dinner with Carrie. During it, I joked that we would see Jen with David (even though it was family night).

Rayyan would tell us during [[2021-12-12 Haven Hot Chicken with Carrie]] that David actually DID go to Franklin, and even wore his contacts (which he didn’t do often)
