# [[2021-12-05]] Eating with [[Carrie]] in Franklin



So glad we decided not to go to Hopper. Got to walk around, stop by TD to see [[Yellow Gingko Tree in Timothy Dwight]], and eat in Franklin.

Food was not the best, so we got some of the pizza and a pretty nice chicken soup.

Afterwards, we spent time in her room, and she showered as I watched some entertaining Youtube videos about Discord raids.

After wards while I was working, David was in the CEID again with Jen, which [[Carrie]] and I went crazy about.
