# [[2021-11-21]] Trip to New Jersey with Carrie


[[New Jersey]]

Woke up early in the morning and grabbed breakfast together with Carrie in Franklin. We had nice muffins, banana chocolate breads, and watermelon. On the way walking to the station, we saw a plate with John Brockett etched on it, remind us of [[John Brockett story]]. Slept on the train there, saw Miriam and Ray, and then got off a stop early.

Eating 4 muffins and 2 banana chocolate breads in a beautiful courtyard near the museum. I offered to take some photos, to her delight, and we took lots of photos. The weather was so pleasant, and we could see Rutgers in the distance!

Afterwards, we went together into the museum. There were so many great exhibits! I cuddled with Carrie and wrapped my arms around her as we went from exhibit to exhibit.

1. The first story was Native American and American art
2. The second a beautiful extraterrestrial purple exhibit with four figures (one of my favorites!)
3. The third was a bunch of Chinese, Korean, and Japanese porcelain that was so beautiful!

We also had a red Tibet display, and I was so stupid and thought [[Thought Incense in rice were chopsticks]].

By the end, the afternoon was far more dark and overcast. We found a Korean place nearby, which was so awesome and I was like [["Nut"]].

We giddily walked over to a Bulgogi restaurant, BulgogiZip, across the street . Carrie treated me which I was so grateful for. We had a nice Bulgogi Bowl and 5 wings/drumsticks with fries.

Finally, we took an Uber together and held hands all the way until the airport. When we went at the gate, I hugged Carrie goodbye and we went to our different ways.

At the airport, I took the AirTrain which was a really cool train in the sky that went around the airport. I waited for the Amtrak and eventually went the way home.
