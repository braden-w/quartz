# [[2021-11-26]] Negotiating a \$40 Credit with Ting. Was Able to Get a Whole Half Off Credit with them!!

 

[[Never Split the Difference]]

Hi Dimetreya, my name is Braden. It's Black Friday, and I am interested in buying an iPhone for my brother… (more stuff)… I realized that it applies to new customers, but we are existing customers. I have an enormous request, and you're going to think that I'm asking too much, that we're trying to use our loyalty, etc.., would it be possible to get that applied to our phone?

After a talk somewhat like the above, she then talked with her manager and asked me if half off the phone would be okay, applied as credit. I said of course!! That was way more than I bargained for and \$250 off.
