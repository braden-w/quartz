# [[2021-12-13]] Going to Ashley's with David and [[Carrie]], Talking About David and Jen and Then Remarking on [[Carrie]] and My Origin Story



We talked to David about Jen, who had held hands with hiim the day before. It was so exciting! Along the way, we remarked that if [[Carrie]] and I were able to prevail, then David would have no problem (given how many second chances I needed).
