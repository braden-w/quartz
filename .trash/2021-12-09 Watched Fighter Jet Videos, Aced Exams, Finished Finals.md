# [[2021-12-09]] Watched Fighter Jet Videos, Aced Exams, Finished Finals

 

Today, I watched a bunch of Jet Videos (F-15 vs. F-18 and F-14, etc.) until like 11:15AM for my 11:35 [[PSYC 179 Thinking]] exam. Even then, I aced the exam and was super stoked!

After, eating mussels and lunch with Carrie in Franklin. Finally, my [[PSYC 130 Introduction to Cognitive Science]] exam. Finished as much as I needed and then called it a day.

I am so relieved and happy that it's over!
