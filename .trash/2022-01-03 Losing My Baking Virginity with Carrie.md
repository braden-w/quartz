# [[2022-01-03]] Losing My Baking Virginity with Carrie

- Talking to Cory about Wendy
- Whisking and using the machine
- Whisk that needed to go up and down
- Licking whipped cream scraps from the spinners
- Eating scraps
- Watching [[Legally Blonde]] together
  [[Carrie noticed my socks matched my shirt]]
  [[My Head is Always Bumping into Stuff]]
  [[Carrie Likes Watching Me Eat and Wouldn't Mind Watching Me Empty the Fridge]]
  [[I Like it Sloppy]]

Got home!! Thank you so much for everything today, it was such a great baking experience and I enjoyed every bit of it! Thank you for feeding me, watching Legally Blonde with me, and most of all, letting me contribute ðŸ¥º and also dealing with the sus whisk ðŸ’€
