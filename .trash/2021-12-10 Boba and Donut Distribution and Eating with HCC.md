# [[2021-12-10]] Boba and Donut Distribution and Eating with HCC



Helped out with sorting and searching for boba and donuts. Grabbed my Taro Boba.

After [[2021-12-10 Crazy 90-minute Ping Pong with Michael, Tony, Ben, and Nikolai in Hopper Buttery]], I got some Thai tea with lychee and drank it. It was so delicious!

I would share the Taro Boba with [[Carrie]] in [[2021-12-10 Working on Yale Buttery Book, Jamming with Carrie and David to a Bunch of Songs]].
