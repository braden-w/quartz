# [[2021-12-18]] Called Carrie, Remarked on How We Were Different From Our Previous Partners



[[2021-09-02 Wow, I Loved Meeting Carrie]]

Couldn't believe that [[2021-09-10 Observatory, 7th Story of Loria Center, Morse, Breaking the Touch Barrier with Carrie]] happened on the same day! We remarked about our progress as a couple. I talked about my first impressions and my first entry on Carrieâ€”that I loved meeting her and thought she was a wonderful person, and made extra emphasis on being respectful.

We talked about how we were different from our past partners. One thing that was funny was how [[Carrie was my slowest, while I was Carrie's fastest]].

Later, I helped Carrie with publishing her [[CS50]] website on Netlify Drop, fixing a small routing error where she used the whole url instead of just /. It was so fun!
