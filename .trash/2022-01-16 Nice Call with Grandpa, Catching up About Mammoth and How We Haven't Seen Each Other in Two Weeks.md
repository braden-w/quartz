# [[2022-01-16]] Nice Call with Grandpa, Catching up About Mammoth and How We Haven't Seen Each Other in Two Weeks



Caught up on [[2022-01-08 - 2022-01-12 Trip to Mammoth with Family and Carrie]]

and

[[2022-01-16 Took an Insanely Long Nap From 2pm to 8pm (6 Hour Nap), Had a Dream That My Brother and I Were Cleaning the Family Cars with Wipees]].

I am so grateful to have been able to call Grandpa. It is so nice to hear his voice!
