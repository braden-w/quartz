# [[2022-01-07]] Reflecting on a New Develop to the COVID Situation



I've come close to having Carrie come with us to Mammoth several times, but unfortunately, no cigar

- Thought Bryce would get better after he felt better the second day, but then he lost his sense of taste
- Thought about sharing some of the truth, but decided to do the right thing and share the whole truth, which costed me all the outings until Thursday (Getty with [[Carrie]], watching movies together, hanging out with Ruobin, and more)

## The Development

Able to get a rapid test, which is super exciting. This seems like the break I was looking for.

## Disappointment

But I took the test, and Bryce was negative but unfortunately dad may have been positive.

I slightly regret having dad test, or having him swab his nose so much.

## After the Development

I called Carrie, and explained the situation. Unfortunately, it seems like the responsible thing is to postpone and have her come some other time.

Edit: It's better, now that we have [[2022-01-07 The Most Crazy Set of Events ðŸŽ¢ðŸ“‰ðŸ“ˆðŸ“‰ Carrie Can Come to Mammoth Now]]
