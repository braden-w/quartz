# [[2021-11-03]] Eating in Morse and Stiles with David after working in the Zoo


So much food! Delicious mustard chicken and pizza, soup, and turkey Mac and Cheese.

Offered and delivered David a Ginger Ale from the soda machine.

We talked about a bunch of things, among them being [[Carolyn]] and [[Aaron from Google|Aaron Gove]], and [[Yale Buttery Book]].
