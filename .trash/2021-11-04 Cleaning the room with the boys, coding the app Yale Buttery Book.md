# [[2021-11-04]] Cleaning the room with the boys, coding the app Yale Buttery Book



Beautiful music as we cleaned up the room, mopped up with my Swiffer, and Sonny and [[Bilal]] offered different cleaning wipes.

Then, we registered our domain name on yalebutterybook.com. Got our own support email too!

[[Bilal]] had a crazy idea: use Google Calendar for our events. Started playing with the APIs and got significant progress!
