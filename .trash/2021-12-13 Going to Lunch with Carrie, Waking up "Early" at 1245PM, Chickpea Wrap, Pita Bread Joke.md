# [[2021-12-13]] Going to Lunch with Carrie, Waking up "Early" at 12:45PM, Chickpea Wrap, [[Pita Bread Joke]]



Ate a delicious Chickpea Wrap. Realized that Pita Bread had an opening in the side, giving birth to the[[Pita Bread Joke]]. Until then, I thought it was so unnecessarily thick and could not wrap.
