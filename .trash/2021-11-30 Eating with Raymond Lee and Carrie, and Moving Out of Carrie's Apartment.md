# [[2021-11-30]] Eating with Raymond Lee and [[Carrie]], and Moving Out of [[Carrie]]'s Apartment



Raymond talked about the difficulties of long distance and the scare where his roommate broke up from his long distance which could have affected morale.

Afterwards, I moved out of [[Carrie]]'s room and moved Crocs down to Hopper.
