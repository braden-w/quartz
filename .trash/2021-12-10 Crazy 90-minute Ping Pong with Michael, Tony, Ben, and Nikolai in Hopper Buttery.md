# [[2021-12-10]] Crazy 90-minute Ping Pong with Michael, Tony, Ben, and Nikolai in Hopper Buttery



Joined Ben and Nikolai in a great doubles game. Did not do as good as my ceiling in the beginning, but that could be because there was not as much room to run around.

We did switching around, alternating hits, and more. When Michael joined, I also went eating in the buttery for the aftermath of [[2021-12-10 Boba and Donut Distribution and Eating with HCC]].

After a long doubles rally, I played a bit with Michael and came back to my ceiling, then called it a night.
