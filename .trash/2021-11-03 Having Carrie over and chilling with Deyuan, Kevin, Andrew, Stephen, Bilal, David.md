# [[2021-11-03]] Having Carrie over and chilling with Deyuan, Kevin, Andrew, Stephen, Bilal, David



It was nice and loud and lively in our suite.

With [[Bilal]], we started drafting out new features for [[Yale Buttery Book]]. We started typing rapidly and flexing it to our friends!

Carrie talked about worries about not growing up, and I said we are not going to grow up in linear path, but in huge steps. There is likely an enormous [[The Black Swan]] event (say, getting a job) that will happen in the future in which we will go from very childish to very grown up quickly.
