	Gamble 1 (0.2, $100; 0.8, -$70
	Normative theories
	Descriptive theories
	Theories of thinking
		Expected Value Theory↔Choose the alternative that maximizes expected value #[[Normative theories]]
			Is it a good descriptive theory? No, because
				Insurance and gambling and lotteries all are popular
				Many preferences involve subjective values, not objective $
					For example, a chicken sandwich (more popular at $3.99) instead of Union League Cafe ($32)
				Everything that Expected Utility Theory can't explain
		Expected Utility Theory↔Different utility functions that give people different inclinations for risk taking and risk aversion #[[Normative theories]]
			Typical Utility Function
				x axis→objective value
				y axis→subjective value
				shape→like \sqrt{x}, concave, diminishing returns
			This shape helps explain Loss aversion
			Examples
				y = \sqrt{x}
				y = x
				y = x^2
	Failure of transitivity↔$700 phone > $600 phone, $800 phone > $700 phone, etc.. But $600 > $1000 phone, when you look in a vacuum
		Changes when you observe in a vacuum
	Descriptive Invariance↔Your utility should not depend on the way the thing is described
		Utility from 80% of being accepted === 20% of being rejected
	Framing Effect↔The way you frame a problem matters
		1/3 probability that 600 people will be saved, but 2/3 that everyone will die
		1/3 probability that nobody will die, but 2/3 that 600 will die
		Telling people they are tasting 75% lean vs. 25% fat beef
			People thought that 75% lean was better on quality, taste, etc. metrics even after tasting it
			5% raise when inflation is 12% > 7% cut when inflation is zero
			95% condom success rate > 5% failure rate

	Expected Value Theory vs. Expected Utility Theory
Lecture 3 September 8th, 2021 #[[September 8th, 2021]]
	Violations of Expected Value Theory are explored in behavioral economics
	Gain function (quadrant 1)↔The function that compares subjective gains over objective gains
	Loss function (quadrant 3)↔The function that compares subjective losses over objective losses
	Prospect theory
		based on→Expected Utility Theory
		takes Expected Utility Theory and makes as few modifications as possible
		Difference between Loss aversion and Risk-aversion↔Loss aversion is risk averse and risk seeking. Risk-aversion is a general bias towards certainty and safety. Loss aversion includes risk aversion #Risk-aversion

                            Loss aversion
                                loss is  2.5  times worse than gain
            Explanations of the Framing Effect  and Loss aversion
                The Gain function (quadrant 1)  is concave  and The Loss function (quadrant 3)  is convex can help explain the Framing Effect

            Risk averse when it comes to gaining money, risk seeking when it comes to losing money
            Endowment effect↔People ascribe more value to things that they own

                Students with the mugs were willing to sell them, on average, for $4.50
                Students with no mugs were willing to buy them, on average, for $2.25
                This is an example of Loss aversion because you are receiving a mug

			This is how Expected Utility Theory is a Normative theories
			It also shows how expected utility theory fails to explain Loss aversion

Lecture 4 September 15th, 2021 and Lecture 5 September 20th, 2021
	We often misperceive/misjudge utilities
		Dorm assignment example #[[Experimental Study]]
			For undesirable dorms, predicted utility < actual utility
			For desirable dorms, predicted utility > actual utility
	Why we misperceive utility
		Reason based choices
			Violation of Procedural invariance
				Procedural invariance↔Preferences should not change
					examples
						Which one do you like more? Which one do you like less? (Regarding ice creams, etc.)

							An example of Procedural invariance
					Very similar to Descriptive Invariance
			Disjunction | The state of not knowing/uncertainty
				Disjunctive state↔People do not know what situation they are in
				Disjunction Effect↔When people are in Disjunctive state , they tend to withhold from making a choice
					Final exam 1 on Monday, Final exam 2 on Wednesday is an example of the Disjunction Effect because you might withhold from studying either , and you would have a hard time studying for the second exam until you know what happens in the first exam
				You find out you get a limited vacation package after a test result #[[Experimental Study]]
					You know you surely passed↔54% want the vacation package
					You know you surely failed↔57% want the vacation package
					You're unsure↔Only 32% want the vacation package

		How Fluency increases utilityAs we get more familiar with decision-making process, we get better at Fluent processing which gives us the illusion of good
			Superficial appearance that affects the fluency of processing
				Fluent processing
					example→Easy to read font for a joke
				Disfluent processing
					example→Hard to read font for a joke
			example of Disfluent processing vs. Fluent processing
				Study 1: Fabricated stocks
					Stocks with easier to pronounce share names had higher performance after 1 year of trading
				Study 2: Pronunceability of 3 letter stock names
					Stocks with easy-to-pronounce names robustly outperformed stocks with difficult-to-pronounce names in the short term

				Study 4: Dancing with the stars
				Study 5: Grade inflation over time with professors
			Order effect↔As we get more familiar with decision-making process, we get better at Fluent processing which gives us the illusion of good
		Focusing illusionWhen judging utilities of other people, we focus too much on salient events (e.g., weather) And ignore all other important factors (mundane pleasure or pain)
			Hedonic adaptation
			Peak-end rule↔People tend to ignore the duration of pain or pleasure. Their overall ratings are influenced by the peak and end
				Study: The penguin and amputation videos
					The videos had a short and long version, but the longer videos had no significant impact compared to the short videos due to the Peak-end rule
				Study: Immerse hand to cold water for short trial vs. long trial%LOCAL_FILE%Lve6FEUUM5yhJe5TqKFHX1c2fA6nk4u57w33ge5oTt3qn2yMLYjpSL7U3R4JYBxUpvSkxSyypyCRWLixruRIybVXGJ7p_uTN9L13Ovbpo1LATGHe1hfgfD44ymU-SCkB.png
		Temporal discounting
			definition↔rewards lose their utility over time, and we rather have things now than later (often at irrational discount rates)
			example→Preferring less money today compared to more tomorrow
			Can be rational because it technically considers unforeseen events, interest rates, inflation , but the irrational part is that we discount way too much and inconsistently
			Why is Temporal discounting irrational
				People behave as if their personal discount rates were much higher than the interest rate available in the market.
				We discount much MUCH more than the chance of unforeseen events.
				People discount inconsistently %LOCAL_FILE%--YaWa8cJ-JmYDnIvR3TQhiWYgOPwEt4qO4JGlh3epiHye4ZKuTe9K_Z2wYtJ3PEabfP6v1_MU5K9WlTNvxkhIjeIVP1XJ2szPTZJU4U-9vphC3XvP1NKJ37DcC5Wa1w.png
			Why are we irrational and fall for Temporal discounting ?
				We overweigh small probabilities, see Subjective Probability Function%LOCAL_FILE%jEZSBTtO8J9fXEGvdU26vQa5VNNMK-QHBd0P3brbe72eebMuMXYM-aeT4pu9Zeh-XITpUiI1e6uGVtHlHWhzVEyKR5i6HXQUxtvi0RMl7KmMex0JzgCrMhG1qTPUwDdm.png
					fix↔Increase the feeling of power to tame the anxiety of the future
				Psychological distance↔Future feels distant, abstract
					fix↔consider looking at the distant self and look at them (look at the study when looking at the aged version of themselves)
				Lack of self-control↔We lack the self-control when confronted with certain stimuli
					fix↔consider hiding the distraction or cue that stimulates it
			Why can't we wait?
				Overweighing small probabilities, fear of uncertainty in the future
				Psychological distance about the future
					Connect with future-self, think about specific events (avatar study where people see themselves as old, and suddenly realize they need to step it up)
				Lack of self-control
					Marshmellow study
					How to increase it
						Distraction
					The perils of too much self control
						Socioeconomically disadvantaged black teenagers from rural Georgia
						The higher amount of self control, the higher level of epigenetic aging (from stress of persisting in such challenging environments)
						To persist or not to persist: Ask yourself, "Can you breathe easily? "
		Sunk cost
			It's hard to estimate stuff
			Judgement of Probabilities
				Availability Heuristic

	Representativeness heuristic↔People's judgements of likelihood are based off representativeness of events/people/objects
		Men are more likely to be murderers
		fallacies due to the Representativeness heuristic
			Base rate neglect
			Conjunction fallacy
			Gambler's fallacy
Lecture 6
	Base rate neglect↔Thinking P(librarian) > P(doctor) because of description, or P(pos | breast cancer) = P(breast cancer | pos)

	Gambler's fallacy↔Thinking that a red square is more likely after a stream of black squares

ReviewSeptember 27th, 2021
	Procedural invariance vs. Descriptive Invariance
		Procedural invariance | Your choice should not depend on how you make choices
			Do I like pistachio ice cream? Do I dislike pistachio ice cream?
			Which one do you like better, BMW or Tesla?
			How much would you be willing to pay for, BMW or Tesla
		Descriptive Invariance | Your choice should not depend on how the options are described
			80% lean = 20% fat
			When 600 people will die, saving 400 = letting 200
			Do you like PSYC 179? = Do you like the PSYC course titled Thinking?
		They're both examples of Framing Effect
		Procedural invariance is more about the question while Descriptive Invariance is more about the options describing the same question
	The number of words with L in the front vs L in the middle is an example of Availability Heuristic because it's easier to think of words that start with L
	Disfluent processing
		If it's harder to generate, then utility can be inflated or deflated
			200 things that are good about Professor Ahn is an example of Disfluent processing
		Shares generated more profit over the course of a year when their names were easy to pronounce
	Risk aversion↔A sure amount is preferred over a risky bet if EV is same
	Is violating transitivity a violation of Expected Value Theory?→No, it is a violation of Expected Utility Theory
Lecture 6 Anchoring October 4th, 2021
	Anchoring and adjustment
		People often make estimates from starting at an initial value (anchor) and adjusting to yield final answer
		How tall is Danny Devito? How tall is Hillary Clinton? Anchored from average of 5'9
		problem→we are heavily swayed by our anchors and don't adjust enough from them

                    %LOCAL_FILE%eYdS9KNgQ7SqgUC6n83lL2nWw7mDalw0jMsoVs_eZvN20OWW0djN248kCCVmFX7e-mv3KeByNPov0PjJIUwiYg-n5OjyiJOsb8lzzSkS7kBg3h7Qf7_pz5Hk0HpcskGu.png 
                
            Bounded Rationality↔In decision making, rationality of individuals is limited by the information they have, the cognitive limitations of their minds, and the finite amount of time they have to make a decision
                example→there's not enough time to consider all the results of a chess game (10^{120})
                conclusion→Perfect rationality is irrational
                    If people have to infer all consequences of their beliefs and 
                Utility maximization or perfect consistency are not feasible in real-life. Trying to do so is not the most rational action
                Satisficing↔Instead of an exhaustive search, an agent searches through alternatives until an acceptable threshold is met
                    comes from→satisfy + suffice
                    Individual differences in Satisficing thresholds

                    Types of satisficers
                        Maximizers
                            Achieve better outcomes
                            Are less happy
                                Possibly because
                                    Choice Overload Effect 
                                    Maximizers regret more than Satisficers (lingering doubt on counterfactual)
                        Choice Overload Effect
                            example | 6 jams vs. 24 jams
                                6 jams
                                    40% of shoppers stopped to taste
                                    30% purchased
                                24 jams
                                    60% stopped to taste
                                    3% purchased

            Heuristics are adaptive
                Evolutionary reasons for having these heurstics
                We have them because they are useful
                Reasoning errors are like visual illusion
                    The problem of perception→2-D retina for a 3-D world

                    Solution→We use heuristics to correct
                        Linear perspective→A type of monocular cue in which parallel lines appear to converge at some point. Leads to visual illusions
                            %LOCAL_FILE%0KYl5SJNX8f0EC0-kExRGD1yIgSSZAY9Pk1H4375nEELXJd0mWs2_o6zhytMKGe46u8_spoJht08HTz89DdpKh5XVLHCVEOwZx0wnoaF4TwmtQQqWW5szSobxacoq2Pi.png 
                Why we have Representativeness heuristic
                    Allow us to do pattern recognition, categorization, etc.
                    Similarity works most of the time, and it's costly to not use this
                    But sometimes leads to irrational judgements
                Why we have Availability Heuristic
                    Typically, things that are more readily available in one's mind are more frequent ones
                    Example (Wendy's vs. McDonald's)
            System 1 vs. System 2 account
                System 1→Quick, effortless, associative, and intuitive
                System 2→Slow, effortful, analytic, and deliberate. Monitors System 1

Lecture 9 October 6th, 2021 Confirmation Bias
	Confirmation Bias in information seeking
		Wason's 2-4-6 task (1968) #[[Experimental Study]]
			Only 1/5 of participants could get the rule without a mistake
			Modification: they only had one shot at the correct answer
				73% still announced an incorrect rule
		Fix: You need to disconfirm your hypothesis
		Why so difficult rule→The correct rule is a superset of the most enticing rule
		%LOCAL_FILE%Iuoar3jzViDzawd13BLVOw2JndVm4Da1eyPJbokr1-_ZOo7gZjQ8WIsaNell01KxK2iDHJezDpEkAPT5Vdc3_sNkRWkyhi52RVpEvwalZ3ulHhyJx6D1Jq70PfJ8EzET.png
		Bloodletting #Example
		Positive-test bias↔People look for the consequences that they would expect if their hypothesis were true (X), rather than what would happen if they were false (not-X).
		Why is positive testing bias bad for you?→Positive testing bias can distort your self-concept
			Two Groups (Kunda & Fong 1993) #[[Experimental Study]]
				"Are you happy with your social life?"→Average of 2.96 Happy thoughts
				"Are you unhappy with your social life?"→Average of 2.50 Happy thoughts (fewer)
			Experimental test result leads to people to think they're depressed #[[Experimental Study]]

		Why is positive testing bias bad for you?
		Confirmation bias is the worst thinking fallacy
		Why do we fall for Confirmation Bias?
			We are cognitive misers
				There are good berries in Forest X. Why would you go out of your way to try Forest Y #Example
			Disconfirmation can be risky→If one truly believes X, it may feel too risky to test not-X in real life
				Bjorn Borg grows out beard before every Wimbledon, too scared to try not growing it out for one year #Example
				Hiring females or minority members feels like a gamble #Example

        Actionable things
            Try a different route to a classroom
            Eat salad for breakfast

    Biases in interpretations of evidence
        Yellow Light is in fact orange  #Example
        Imposter syndrome  #Example
            Compliments→I was lucky
            Criticisms→I'm hopeless
        Your friend not replying to your texts #Example

        Capital Punishment study #[[Experimental Study]] 
            When people read initial results, they are swayed in direction of evidence/findings of the data
            When they revied full studies, they returned back to their initial belief, reflecting a Biased Assimilation and Polarization of the details of their study
            When read what supported their beliefs, they were excited, but when they didn't, they quickly dismissed them
            Regardless of what evidence they saw, both groups saw an increase in polarization 
        Biased Assimilation and Polarization↔We get more polarized, despite evidence can either support or disprove our beliefs

Lecture 10 October 11th, 2021 Causal and Counterfactual Reasoning
	1918 flu pandemic > Woodrow Wilson > Paris Peace Conference
		Wilson wanted to advocate for lenient punishment for Germany, but got sick
		Challenges in causal judgements
			We shouldn't be so sure
			Infinite possibilities makes it hard
			There's no way to go back in time and verify our theory
		Cues
			Necessity→Wilson's flu was necessary for the Paris peace conference to result in lenient penalties for Germany
				But a butterfly flapping in Samoa was not necessary for WWII
				But-for test
			Abnormality→We tend to pick unusual events as causes
				%LOCAL_FILE%ygHMH5sSz2Zy5fWrXKREa9islAP11h33gECXtV6IYviQhvSrFNOvtGMVP0ohLUS90BKbDphezXhxkKcng9CeFEW6dfn0KPA3uLNJXpG2lcDeNHoRzOXVyVFNde9b5El2.png
			Recency→The most recent event in a temporal sequence, it's more likely that the more recent caused the event
				%LOCAL_FILE%mF1MccNbIuqSLXITS9ERiTre5v8JCP70WquW-94hWmTPXWEAj4A4FPn9R-xgI6L2aCiJG8CM2Fnu_Lkif99d7Pw1OG1Xn08CMWdRQL4u6CGfEd2pPuRgn19TjjesS1Qx.png

            Sufficiency and Discounting
                Sufficiency→Whenever X happens, Y happens. This means X is a sufficient condition for Y
                Discounting→We discount another possible cause if there is a known cause because the known cause is Sufficiency for the outcome
                    Screaming while someone stepped on foot→Discount other options because we think it's because someone stepped on foot
                    %LOCAL_FILE%Dnv_3XyG9UfHsoOAKAP4qJEmi_vyBV1bLsibsUNEiaCRid_JVNL28rLq7qef5J7r0J_ClvVp1gA8NO0t7C-JqO1KP4FfhLcbfmI2qD9bg__j8UHLcG-QIL1AU-dMAM2U.png
                    We tend to discount people as talented when they work hard, because working hard is a possible area of Discounting 
                        Mozart's widow burned 90% of his early sketches to reinforce the idea that he was talented and didn't need hard work
            Similarity→We believe causes and effects should be proportional. We expect large cause for large effect
                %LOCAL_FILE%m0cA_1ZfRxFWBg-lQ7WKFQBi4RY5Ks68GVyO6mxaqzuOEp3GXsnh46pxOmUUpgXLCVetpYqQTorTlRiAxPXAZ94cDwCgT6CKpOWN-aYihX7wKuL0mUPSW8O-MsEFK00Q.png
                People were reluctant of germ theory because they could not believe tiny germs could harm people 
                Reinforced because of nature
                    Size of punch correlates to size of pain, size of animal correlates to roar
            Regression fallacy→We neglect regression toward the mean
                Regression to the mean↔Extremely high or low values tend towards the mean when tested again
                    Why it happens→You are "lucky" to get a score far from the range, and are more likely to get one closer on the second time
                Random true false like what's the parity of Jennifer Lopez's SSN
                    %LOCAL_FILE%bD9EJtyhm18cY4dkhvdo5eh5OXueEI-z9NKOzC7D85wxuGhaHgzuklrJQDbR1YexU3ECFSn8jDOfPswfn6kCMk83d_VUGopiJpc1PbZrl2KjaV5pWc6BW-XDkvaqRw8a.png
                    If you got 0-10 or 90-100, you would definitely get a higher or lower score the next time (to the mean) 
                Jinxes in sports: Serena's Calendar Slam, the Patriots' dominating streaks all ended after covered in sports magazines. One could call calling causality from abnormality of events
        But-for test↔In order to ascribe causal status to an actor, one should believe that for but for the causal candidate in question, the outcome would not have occurred
        Not all necessary conditions are causes
            Oxygen for fire, but we don't blame oxygen for fire
            Birth as a cause of death, but we don't blame parents for death
            
            
        Did President Wilson's Flu cause Hitler's Rise to Power?
            What cues do we use to draw causal conclusions?
            LEt's use some heuristics, which could go wrong but should try
