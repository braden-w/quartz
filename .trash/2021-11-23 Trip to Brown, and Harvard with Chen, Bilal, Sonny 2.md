# [[2021-11-23]] Trip to Brown, and Harvard with Chen, Bilal, Sonny




# Preparation

- Waiting for Chen and then walking to medical school, joking with the boys along the way
- Stuck with car setup. We have to press the phone button, then REFUSE to set up bluetooth, to expose the phone settings
- Pick up food at Dunkin and McDonald’s. Grabbed an Egg McMuffin with Sonny which was super good

# Road Trip with the Boys

The road trip was so fun! We talked a lot and played a BUNCH of songs—rock, pop, hip hop, country, etc.—and had a great time along the way

- Stop to New London and beach with the gang. Nice weather and pictures with the gang
- Then we went to a museum for the USS Nautilus. It was closed unfortunately, but it was so cool to see museum that wasn't too far away!!

# Brown

Drab but somewhat cool. Went on Green and [[Carrie]] tower, had a very nice man take pictures for us. Hilarious dialogue where Aryan was trying and failing to argue that a mobius strip had one side

# Boston

Passed Boston dynamics, secured parking in Harvard building with the help of Sonny purchasing a ticket.

Free Ben and Jerry’s on the way out. Waved to professor in window since their window had a sign that said "wave, it's my birthday!" and they smiled and waved back (wholesome moment).

Along the way, we joked with Aryan about his Yale T-shirt. ^5e43bf

## Harvard

### Yard

Yard was beautiful! On the way there, we saw some supposed Harvard kids pointing as us, reinforcing ![[#^5e43bf]], but they turned out to be Yale students and we yelled AYYY as they picked up their Yale Masks and flashed them and put them on for a moment. 

### Tour with Justin to Dining Hall and Observatory

Aryan met his friend Justin, who showed us to the freshman dining hall. Beautiful!! Just like [[Commons]], with extra salt and pepper shakers that [[Bilal]] pointed out.

Afterwards, he took us to the top of the science building, where we looked at the telescope (out of service due to water damage) and a balcony overlooking the entire city! He explained that he needed to take a quick course to get 24/7 access to the balcony.

### Pho, Walking Around Cambridge, and Cannolis

Went on the way to get some food. Saw [[Jerry (Shawn Pan's Friend)]] and [[Eric (Shawn Pan's Friend)]] from [[Shawn Pan]]'s visit, and [[Sonny]] too saw his friends.

Eating Pho noodles at [[Le’s]]. [[Bilal]] talked about [[Bilal's pet Piranha and assorted aquatic animals (turtles, catfish, etc.)]]. Sonny talked about [[MIT]] pronunciation among Vietnamese parents, which was like "Mitt"

Afterwards, we headed to the Kennedy center, discussing [[John F. Kennedy]]'s interesting foreign policy with [[Bilal]] and enjoying the scenery and how enormous foreign policy discussions were held in that very room. It was a sight to behold.

Cannoli's from [[Mike's]]. It was decadent, and we beat the line!

## MIT

Visited MIT and met [[Sonny]]'s friend Walli, who was super nice!! This was Aryan and [[Bilal]]'s first time visiting MIT, and we were absolutely BLOWN AWAY by how amazing the building [[Architect|architecture]] was. Specifically, the dorms for masters students had a wonderful protrusion with what we believed to be the [[Architect]]'s signature on the bottom. Iconic, modern, and expectation-defining.

Tunnel system and chairs after we gawked in the outside courtyard. The walls were painted with pictures that became animated when you pointed your app to them in a certain app!

We then walked through main campus, the dome, and so many labs. Saw glass blowing!

Finally, we visited dorms, which were the only yikes moment of the trip. There were no common rooms, and we felt like the writing on the wall and loneliness really could get into our heads if we attended.

And they have school until Thanksgiving! Even on Wednesday.

We then sat in a classroom, where [[Bilal]] wrote Hindi about Yale and MIT as a "hack".

## Little Italy

Walk to Little Italy; beautiful swings along the way.

Quaint little Italian restaurant called [[Giacomo's]], cash only, definitely a laundering business. Delicious two lobsters and lobster pasta! This was Sonny and Aryan's first lobster experiences, which was so great to introduce them to with [[Bilal]].

Nice Italian cafe, [[Cafe Vittoria]]. Had NO idea that it was the first Italian cafe in Boston, frequented by famous people. Aryan had ice cream and espresso for the first time and was initially underwhelmed, but then it hit and he was smiling giddily and saying, I’m awake now! Why don’t we just run there lol. We had cheesecake and napoleon which was delicious.

Walked back satisfied with the crew and some of us sufficiently buzzed by coffee.

# Return Trip

- Talked about how [[The Rate You Learn a Skill is Not Dependent on the Complexity of the Skill, but How Necessary it is for Survival]] when talking about how I learned cs so fast to explain to Chen that I was EPE and not CS.
- Incredibly fast changeover to take the Uber, arrive back at 2:44 AM
