# [[2021-10-31]] Amazing photos on Halloween with Carrie, thank you Selina!


The conclusion of [[2021-10-20 Discussing being an ABG and FBoy for Halloween over Oatmeal Ice Cream at Branford with Carrie]]

Stopped by Mai to pick up a silver chain. She ended up giving me two; of difference sizes too so I could wear them at once.

Carrie looked so gorgeous. I asked her whether I should use my striped shirt or black shirt, and she said the black shirt (my pajamas, specifically, instead of my A&F one). When I put the silver chains on, my aesthetic changed completely. It was so great!

We took some pictures together with Selina, both in the hallway and in the suite in front of the fairy lights. It was a great time!!

I sent a story to Yvonne of my chain, and she misinterpreted it and sent a poll on her PUBLIC instagram asking others if I should keep the chain. I clarified to her that it was not in fact a lasting change, and she was much better.

Afterwards, I hugged Carrie and we looked at each other through her full body mirror. It was very cute and wholesome. A great day and time overall!!
