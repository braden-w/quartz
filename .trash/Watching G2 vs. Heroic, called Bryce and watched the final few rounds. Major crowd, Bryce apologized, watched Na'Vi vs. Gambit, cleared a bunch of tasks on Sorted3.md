# Watching G2 vs. Heroic, called Bryce and watched the final few rounds. Major crowd, Bryce apologized, watched Na'Vi vs. Gambit, cleared a bunch of tasks on Sorted3
Bryce apologized for [[2021-10-31 Not the most fortunate turn of events#^979114]]

Na'Vi vs. Gambit was crazy! Na'Vi won on Gambit's pick of Overpass and absolutely STOMPED them on Mirage, 16-3. It was great watching these moments with Bryce. There were plenty of highlight moments, among them being TWO knife kills in back to back fashion.
