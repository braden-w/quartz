# Apology to YEA About Social Event EA Against Humanity
Holy crap

My bad guys. Nothing much I can say except that I could have done a lot of a better job on that one, it was unplanned diffusion of responsibility with poor delegation on my end. I had assigned it to Koray and Gian but then split them on their assignments after they finished preparing early (Koray worked on one project and Gian worked on a different project in the meantime before July 8ish), and it had not occurred to me to make one of them ultimately in charge of the event (especially while I was in London) so the task fell through. Even worse, I had miswrote in my task manager the date, so my daily checks didn’t catch that (edited) 

We had originally actually planned for July 16

Would it be objectionable to make an update about our mistake in [#announcements](https://yaleea.slack.com/archives/C04DKJNL4) and then relaunch the event next week?
