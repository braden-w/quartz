# Sensitizing Versus Tolerance Reaction (Why Exposure Causes [[Allergies]] versus [[Immunity]])
The two paths you're referring to there are called a "sensitizing" reaction (i.e. gets more sensitive with repeated exposure) vs a "tolerance" reaction (gets less sensitive with repeated exposure). What's supposed to happen is that the sensitization responds to the stimulus, but if it turns out not to be pathogenic, the tolerance reaction will activate and suppress it.

Thus, the short answer is "sensitization is what happens when the tolerance mechanisms fail to work correctly", but that's not particularly helpful. The obvious next question is "why?". Unfortunately for a simple explanation.. immune systems are horrendously complicated.

This is one of the more approachable papers I've seen on the topic, though it's still pretty rough going.
