# "Your Time is Better Spent Championing Good Ideas Than Tearing Down Bad Ones.
[[James Clear]]
"Your time is better spent championing good ideas than tearing down bad ones.

The best thing that can happen to a bad idea is that it is forgotten. The best thing that can happen to a good idea is that it is shared.

Feed the good ideas and let bad ideas die of starvation."
