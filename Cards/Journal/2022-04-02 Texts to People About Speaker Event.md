# [[2022-04-02]] Texts to People About Speaker Event
**Anusha**

Hey Anusha, it’s Braden, a friend of Bilal’s! I was wondering if you could share this event in Yale Women’s Leadership Initiative—it’s an opportunity for WLI members to talk to a two-time congress representative!

Yale Effective Altruism will be hosting a speaker event with Elizabeth Edwards-Appell, former two-time Democratic representative of New Hampshire (2014-2018) passionate about harm reduction, civil liberties, and prison reform. She has helped pass 911 immunity laws, syringe exchange legalization, and marijuana decriminalization. Notably, she helped pass a bill to give drug users immunity from prosecution when they report a drug-related medical emergency. Catered dinner and an open Q&A will be provided for attendees.

We ask that all attendees sign up here prior to the event in order to guarantee food: https://forms.gle/8CVLvivVk6MFQTeF6

**Aarya and Aryan**

Hey Aarya, huge favor to ask: I was wondering if you could share this event in YPU—it’s an opportunity for YPU members to talk to a two-time congress representative, and could be interesting!

Hey Bryson, it’s Braden, a friend of Daevan’s! We may have met briefly—I was in a DHSRI event with Bilal about impact investing after Daevan invited us.

I had a huge and urgent favor to ask: I was wondering if you could share this event in The Politic, Yale Dems, DHSRI, and anyone who might be interested—it’s an opportunity for members to talk to a two-time congress representative, and might be interesting! Daevan told me you would be the guy.
