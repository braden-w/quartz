# 2022-06-13 First Post About No Stupid Questions
Welcome to [# no-stupid-questions-all-critiques-welcome](https://yaleea.slack.com/archives/C03KGMARQBD)! This channel is a space to discuss critiques, questions, and more about Effective Altruism and the broader EA community. We hope people will use this channel to engage and critically examine the aspects of EA, philosophically and in practice.For critiques and questions about YEA specifically, see [# feedback](https://yaleea.slack.com/archives/C03KVELEBNV).**Guidelines:**

- Post a summary of a question, critique, or topic in this channel. This should only be **1-2 sentences long** and should be prefaced with a category such as “Topic:” or “Question:“.
- If you want to elaborate and/or attach additional information to your topic, **please respond to yourself in a thread.** There is no limit on how much you can write in threads!
- Please respond to topics in threads (please do not create another message!).

These rules enable us to have threads that don’t take too much of channel space and make scrolling easier.We value open-mindedness and independent thought in YEA, and many of these questions reflect the values that we wish the movement to grow upon. Please be respectful of others at all times. There are no stupid questions here, and we welcome questions of all types!
