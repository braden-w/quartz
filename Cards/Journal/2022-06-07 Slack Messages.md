# 2022-06-07 Slack Messages
Talked a bit about this with Simon, then Koray. With Simon, we shared a vision to make YERI and YEA form a “balanced venn diagram”, where both attract different audience with overlap in the middle (not one taking all the members of the other). With Koray, we were thinking of having YERI start out with Existential-Risk-Aligned curriculum—so fellowships in AI, Biorisk, and maybe Nuclear or other areas. This feels intuitive to me because I felt like YEA focuses a lot on intro and indepth, but AI /existential fellowships are not particularly our focus  (for example, last semester we had both the EA Cambridge and internal AI Governance fellowship, attendance for the latter was not very high) and it might not be a bad idea to have these fellowships enjoy the resources of a dedicated team in an adjacent organization
