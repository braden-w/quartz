- Moral progress, and is it reversible?

- [[Sentience as a definition of having interests]]

- Should we create a hierarchy based off capacity to suffer?
- Cute animals are often preserved more

- Nudge theory
- It's not that we are equal, but that you consider our interests equally - Racism is wrong because not because we're not different, but race should not be relevant
