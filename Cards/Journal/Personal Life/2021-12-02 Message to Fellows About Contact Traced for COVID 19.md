# [[2021-12-02]] Message to Fellows About Contact Traced for COVID 19
[[YEA Fellowship]]

Hey fellows, important update: I have been contact traced, and so our fellowship facilitator Eui Young will be leading today's discussion.

A person I had recently eaten lunch with has tested positive for COVID. Although I am vaccinated and am not required to isolate, I would like to minimize transmission and do my best to ensure your safety.

During today's discussion, in addition to questions your facilitators may pose, each group will be tasked with creating and discussing a forecast about the future, its difficulties and uncertainties, and presenting it to the rest of the group at the end!

Have a wonderful rest of your discussion and I'll see you later!
