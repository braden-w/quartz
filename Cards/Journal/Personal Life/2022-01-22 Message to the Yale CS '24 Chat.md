# [[2022-01-22]] Message to the Yale CS '24 Chat
Hey everyone!! @Mahesh Agarwal (Branford) brought up the ride sharing problem to me a few days ago and how we could go about tackling the transport problem (huge shoutout to him!)

Made a little concept website here: [https://yaleshare.netlify.app/](https://yaleshare.netlify.app/)

Do y'all have any suggestions on how we could make it better?

- I feel like it is a little less usable than a Google Sheet in its current state
- I'd be a little skeptical about giving private information to this page unless it's behind some wall (which we can make)
- Can integrate above features and improve privacy, since I feel that is pretty important and an advantage of a dedicated website
- I've been working on it for about half a day, so there's lots of room for improvement!
