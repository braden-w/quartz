The important advice - it's okay.

"It's okay to be wrong. It's okay to admit it. I'd rather have you admit than anything else.

 

# Forget What You Want, This is How You Actually Influence People
"You can get away with just letting them know how they feel. I know its the wrong way, but more importantly I am uncomfortable doing it. They look like a jerk.

 

Ask for favors? Include this one thing - how you feel

No need to frontload reasons, that makes them think you expect resistance.

 

# Giving Criticism
Talk about problems, not people. The actions, not the person. What are you communicating behind the scenes? You're better than this

 

How it makes you feel, if vulnerable (Earbuds and sneaking up burglar - Don't want to see a burglar vs. Don't want to ever think that you're not safe, that makes me feel scared) - You can argue you never see a burglar but you never argue that you won't feel scared, since you'll always be here even if the burglar isn't a chance.

 

You can get away with just letting them know how they feel. I know its the wrong way, but more importantly \*I am uncomfortable doing it.\* They look like a jerk.

 

You control the narrative. Bad attributions to actions, good attributes to themselves. Subconsciously expecting me. There's a guy who's bad. You say be realistic, why expect more. Is there any tangible benefit by assuming he is less than he is? Better to be over. (refer to realistic article)

 

Bad actions, good person. Build their identity. Don't do stupid things vs. don't be stupid. Good identity, bad as temporary labels

 

If you want to change people, be sure you aren't doing this wrong - Using ""are"". Why do you have to be that way? Why do you have to act that way? It's easy to dismiss something when you just say ""That's the way I am"". It's hard when you're supposed to be much better.

 

Easy to spitefully say ""sure"" when ""you're so dumb"". Harder to say no to ""you're better than this"".

 

Understated how important self-discovery is. Let them find out. If you tell them you set expectations. If they find out they have anticipation.

 

hey y'all, heard from Ethan that we had a bit of miscommunication about WF prom com jobs

just wanted to clarify on what we meant, and say that I totally get it. It was unfair to ask on short notice, and your reaction is a completely natural. I would feel the exact same way if I were you guys.

I think we can agree that the last thing we want is more people to work longer hours. That's why Ethan and I are cutting down on as many jobs as possible this year. Even so, there were some gaps we wished prom com to fill, so that all shifts could be super super short. It was not necessary, but this would be great relief for all the ASB members working for the entire day. We just wanted to make it a bit easier for them.

But I still want to hear your story! I know I can be missing something, so let me know everything that may be on your mind. I know we can work an arrangement out 🙂

to get the ball rolling, do we think we could realistically plan on having at least 10 prom com members help out with shifts?

 

Ask them questions, they change themselves.

 

A personal argument warrants a personal response. Do not make it personal. Then they will spite you and entrench."

 

Guide to Arguing

"It takes two to start an argument. A personal argument warrants a personal response.

 

Your opinion doesn't matter as much as your willingness to defend it, or change it, or listen to others

 

Stop Arguing with People, Start Asking Questions (They think you're on their side, they argue with themselves). Nobody to oppose them except their imagination

 

Avoid engagement if possible. Genuine interest in their argument. Arguing are based on emotion, not points. Drain the excess emotion by asking more. Tell me more how bad it is..

 

Why is much harder to disagree with than how.

Leaving Awkward Situations

"Tell them action, not should. Rephrase your words to incite action, not just should be

I'm leaving right now."

Confront without being confrontational"

"Entitled VS infringing

 

When you are following up and seeing if everything is ok because no response, flip the mindset. Not concern or worry or anxious they haven't responded, but entitled. You deserve better. You have the relationship

 

You must not be afraid to talk about sex or drugs or they will not share"

Change the frame

Sarcasm requires intelligence, but you can be even more intelligent

 

 

Taking criticism

Taking ownership

Roll with punches

 

The Ultimate Guide to Reconciliation

I don't care about what we said earlier. I was angry, I didn't want it to go that far. But we are a family. Let's get closer again.

 

Order matters

Climatic sentences in writing and storytelling, periodic in talking and business I'm applying to summer camps, I am applying and wondering Rec VS wondering Rec, I am applying. This is the use of time in writing.

 

Dealing with Bullies

They keep on doing it because they like your reaction. Want them to stop? Don't give them the right reaction. Link "control your reactions"

 

Advertising

"Stop worrying about what to say, start concerning about how to feel. Focus on the feel. Stand up straight, shoulders back

 

Do you remember what they said? No? Then stop thinking about what to say! Do you remember what they made you feel? Yes? Then make them feel that way

 

What Fundraising taught me

-It really means a lot to me….

-We've been working really hard….

-Write your ideas along the way, then expand. Don't just sit

Upward vs. Downward inflection

Essential. Act confident to be confident. Act pose to be pose

 

Giving Ideas

"""Don’t tell people it’s your idea, ban “I have an idea” or “I have a great idea”.

Let them believe it’s their idea instead. You can do it by feeding broad or vague strands they can flash out themselves to feel like they did it."""

 

"Money was never a good motivation for me, except as a way of keeping score. The real excitement is in playing the game. I don’t spend too much time worrying about what I should have done differently or what’s going to happen next. If you ask me exactly what the deals I’m about to describe all add up to in the end, I’m not sure I have a very good answer. Except that I’ve had a very good time making them." - Donald Trump

 

If you want to make friends, make people feel better when you're with them than when you are not
