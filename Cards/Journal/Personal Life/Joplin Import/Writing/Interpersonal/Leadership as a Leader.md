# Leadership as a Leader
 

The Ultimate Guide to Cultivating Respect
If you want people to listen, do this one thing. Don't react
 
Power - Just don't react - no needy, argument give silence, etc.
 
There is no fear in taking ownership. There are two ways to react to something
 
No reactive, but proactive
 
 
As Chris Dyer has rightly said.
**“Give feedforward not feedback.”**
* *
Inflection
"No big deal" talking about weaknesses
Lick finger, shrinks or no reaction
"Speak only when you fully intend on finishing your sentence" - Charisma in Command
 
Be actionable
 
Diction is a scalpel, not a hammer.
 
Some small tips for phrasing
The importance of let's go vs. we should go, we have to go, etc.. Organize your diction to ask for action
 
How are you doing --&gt; How's life --&gt; How are you feeling
 
You control the narrative
 
"Tell me your story, not ""Tell me about yourself""
"
Wording of milgram
Inclusive Vocabulary
"You do this vs let's do this.
 
We, not I. Are you interested in this product? Are we interested in this product?"
 
Screw being vulnerable. It's about not being afraid to be vulnerable
"When you say ""I'm vulnerable"", are you actually saying it in a vulnerable way?
 
"No way, you say it with confidence
 
How a small nuance in your approach changes everything about your life
 
Not just admit your mistakes and failures. Don't be afraid to admit your mistakes and failures be confident. What's the worse?
You are not communicating that you are vulnerable. You are communicating that you are not afraid to talk about sensitive subjects.
 
Purpose of praise
Make people want to do again
Make them feel useful. Like my article in Philosophy.
 
The Ultimate Guide to Delegation
Do the aspects, not the tasks. Everyone is a leader. Assign problems, not tasks.
Do not microassign tasks. Assign projects
 
Diversity is great, but it doesn't work if you can't do this
Diversity and discourse is great
The I in team
 
You don't have to say but as a leader. No need to put defensive. Ditch the word.
"I like your idea, but…" or you could say "I like your idea, and…"
 
You need Safety
"Make people feel safe. You can be yourself around me. Confidence is safety. Leadership is safety
 
Biologically - High Stress Environment = less sympathy and less generous, don't protect each other because we're protecting ourselves (layoff effects)
 
How can we be comfortable
Touching in relationships
Never penalize
Not just when the goings get easy but when the goings get hard, I want to hear you say, ""Braden, I believe in you"" because that's all I will say to you.
You need a culture that sustains, a circle of safety extends to all corners in this Room, Campus, World
 
Elevate. Do not be cutthroat
 
I care about you and you should care about yourself"
 
The Ultimate Guide to Introverted Leading
To change people don't give solutions, identify problems stop talking vs talking too much
"You're either a problem or a solution
"
What do you make of that?
 
Simon Sinek
You cannot incentivize performance. You can only incentivize behaviors. Then you're incentivizing the behaviors that cause that performance
Leading company vs company that leads
The styrofoam cup.Most of the time we are awarded for our status or position, not for who we are. We all deserve styrofoam cups.
We are promoted to what we are worse at.
Biologically - High Stress Environment = less sympathy and less generous, don't protect each other because we're protecting ourselves (layoff effects)
When we work hard on something we believe in, it's called passion. When we work hard on something we don't believe in, it's called stress. —Simon Sinek
 
I can't tell you how it ends.
But I can tell you how it starts. I can't tell you how any of this ends. I can't tell you …
Your teammates should just do things because they like you
Brainstorming is not as much about the final product as it is the journey to getting there
 
Never penalize
 
Dear Council
"
I did this because I don't have an ego. I came here for your trust. For you to trust me for what I am, not respect me for what I have done. I have found that it is success that breeds respect, but it is failure that truly breeds trustThere should be a life in your council outside of ASB
 
Know that when I'm upset, it's because I expected better, because you are better.
 
You may say I don't know some things or I don't understand you… And you're exactly right
 
I didn't come to guarantee change. I came to ask permission so that we could guarantee change. I can't change things. I need your help
 
I can't promise you success, but I can promise you failure. I can't promise you living, but I can promise you death. That's the beauty of it, can nothing be more liberating? If failure is a natural part of life, then we are pursuing success, not avoiding failure.
 
I can't guarantee you I will not make mistakes. I can guarantee will make mistakes. I guarantee I will learn from them though. I hope we all do the same
 
Believe in each other, enjoy the company of each other, like each other, trust each other
 
I Can't tell what we can do, but can that everyone else is capable of doing all the tasks… and more
"
 
The Power of Decisiveness
Leadership is decisionmaking. Everyone is a leader. Link
 
We follow leaders not for them but for ourselves
 
Listening
I'll be a good dad. Because I listen
 
Same result, different process
 
Job Interview
How your skills benefit them
#1 Question - how do you know you picked the right one?
 
Everyone be part of decision process
 
[["Bill Gates Was a Watchmaker. Steve Jobs Was a Timeteller."]]
 
You will get all the credit. The funny thing is that they will reward you.
