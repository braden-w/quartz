"I have to tell you something" vs. "I need to get something off my chest"

Problems are about you, good things are about them

This isn't about you. It's about what you're doing

 

Find your passion vs. not

 

Goals vs. no goals

 

Advice vs. feedback

Boss vs. leader

You do this vs let's do this.

 

We, not I. Are you interested in this product? Are we interested in this product?"

 

Men vs. Women

Women need love to have sex, men need sex to feel loved

Men want to connect vs. Women want to be understood

A woman's loyalty is tested when her man has nothing and a man's loyalty is tested when he has everything

Women are reactive, men are proactive

Women are appreciated for what they are vs. Men are appreciated what they can do for them

Men are trained to not be reacting to get respect

Guys niche then family, girls family then niche

Women plan breakups months in advance. They premeditate, while men see it crumble in weeks

Men seek fertility, women seek stability

Men establish themselves as high up as they can, then have a relationship

Women have a relationship as high up as they can, then they establish themselves

That's why when a woman breaks up with a man, she deserves better. And more importantly, he's just not good enough.

 

How men are raised zero sum, while women abundance
