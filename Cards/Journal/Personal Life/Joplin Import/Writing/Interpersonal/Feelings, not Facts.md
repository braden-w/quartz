Feelings, not Facts

# Storytelling
Focus on Emotions, not Facts
Stop focusing on details, more elaborate
As Feelings Fade, So To Does Reality
Â 

# Emotion Flips
Love and hate is a bell curve, and they're at the peak right next to each other. It isn't a gradient. Attraction flips, not sliding along a scale
Â 

 Be Deep

See intent beyond superficial actions.

# Humanize Them.
Not paying attention in class? What if I told you they're Grandma died?

 A Guide to Empathy/Understanding

It's okay to not understand.
What you're going through is totally normal. I'm sure if I were in your position, I would think the same. (Draw other parallels).
Just listen and be there for you, "you don't have to go through this alone"
They vent, then pause. A lot. Then say "tell me more about how bad xx" throw them off guard. Syringe all the vitriol away"
Â 
Have to find out what this is. Then pause 2 to 4 seconds. Lean in, makes them nervous. Say more about me being a terrible boyfriend, since that sounds really messed up. Seriously, you have my undivided attention. Really? Wow, that sounds terrible. Don't pull any punches. Tell me an example when I was the worst. Worst boyfriend, etc. That was horrendous that I did that. On a scale of 1 to 10, how bad was that? 10 being never be together again. Talk to me like I'm 5. What are some things I should do all the time, and some things I should never do. I'm sorry.
Â 
Wow, I don't know what to say. I can't help you kill yourself, but I just want to let you know if you do I will still think well of you, and will miss you.
More venting. ""You have my full attention. Tell me more about the worst"
Â 
"hey y'all, heard from Ethan that we had a bit of miscommunication about WF prom com jobs
just wanted to clarify on what we meant, and say that I totally get it. It was unfair to ask on short notice, and your reaction is a completely natural. I would feel the exact same way if I were you guys.
I think we can agree that the last thing we want is more people to work longer hours. That's why Ethan and I are cutting down on as many jobs as possible this year. Even so, there were some gaps we wished prom com to fill, so that all shifts could be super super short. It was not necessary, but this would be great relief for all the ASB members working for the entire day. We just wanted to make it a bit easier for them.
But I still want to hear your story! I know I can be missing something, so let me know everything that may be on your mind. I know we can work an arrangement out ðŸ™‚
to get the ball rolling, do we think we could realistically plan on having at least 10 prom com members help out with shifts?"
Forget how you think. Focus on how you feel
Don't think. If you had to think about going down the stairs while going down the stairs you would fall.
Â 
The worst way to show control
Grumpiness and losing temper is the worst showing of discipline. We think that by being upset it demonstrates that we know seething that someone did not. Or that it was not our fault. Doesn't matter. Nothing is more damaging on the character. So take ownership of your temper. Manage it
Someone in complete control has no need to be defensive or negatively emotional
Don't react
Â 
Go deep. Not just mindfulness. But thinking about behaviors, failures and successes
Â 
Emotions are linked through intensity, not polarity. Love is closer to hate than it is to like.
