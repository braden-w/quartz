The Best Things Come that You Don't Need

I'm doing my own thing

Set the pace

Frame: Your loss if you reject me

Not needy, but not afraid to show interest

 

Relationship Tips

You need tension

Set the pace

 

Attraction Tips

Most attractive trait: pursuing things you like. It's fun to be chased. People want to be chased

 

People want to be chosen. Don't be desperate or needy because people rather have someone with more interests, and become the priority"

 

Asking

How to not be nervous: understand that love is not a choice. I normally don't condone conceding what you can't control, but you can't control who you have feelings for. You can control what you do with them, though. Knowing this is the key. You tried to keep your distance, but you couldn't.

 

You can't control how others think of you. How they see you. How they act around you. But you can control how you think of them. How you see them. How you act around them. Continue it up

Asking someone: You don't know what happens if you ask her. But you definitely know what happens if you don't ask her. You're not afraid if she says no. You're afraid if she says yes.

 

Never angry for bad traffic, but a late start

 

Fast Friends

"People say telling others about yourself gets you close. It's other way around.

 

Friends know each other too much. You have no choice but to keep them close. That's why they make the deadliest enemies. But you can use this tactic to make fast friends.

 

You feel closest to the people not who you know the most but who know about you the most"

To all the times you ever wanted to say something. To comfort them. Just do it. Don't worry about how or what to say. That comes in time. Sally

 

Neediness

Nothing is more needy than wondering what's needy

 

Investment

Perfect relationships aren't found. They're built.

 

To the world you are one person, to one person you are the world

"No relationship is reciprocal. This isn't Facebook, but instagram

 

To me, my friends may be one of a hundred interactions every day, but to them, I may be the only one—so every single one needs to count."

 

Relationships end in failure or death.

Use it for asking, use it for rejection.

 

Everyone falls out of love. It's the only way you can face reality, or love something else. Could be person or profession

 

Nobody controls how they feel. Just how they express. You want her to express interest when she doesn't feel?
