WOOO amazing talk on direct talk intervention. I almost didn't show up but did and gave an amazing speech to them.

 

Malaria nets is a good example. Through pidgeonholing ourselves on a narrow subset of problems we lead to unintended consequences.

 

A good point is that as a 3rd party, we are able to observe issues that they are not able to in their immediate lives. However, that isn't to say we are entitled or know how to spend their money than they do. If you ask anyone in their day-to-day lives, they are fully aware of a problem that is immediately facing them.
