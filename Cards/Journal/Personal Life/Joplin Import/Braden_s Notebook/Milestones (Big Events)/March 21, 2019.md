PM

 

I dreamt of the AMC is today. God is blessing me to be swift and on time for this test. I am praying that the best shall come today. The culmination of all my hard work and efforts has come!

 

I'm on my way to victory.

I'm on my way to success.

I'm on my way to a great mathematical test.

 

I am grateful to be in this moment. There is a great deal of doing to be done. My senses are tingling with excitement. I feel the breath surging through my vains. There is delight to be in the moment.

 

I've been waiting for this moment for so long. IT'S TIME TO GET THIS DONE! LET'S DO THIS! I rest my case. Bless me, Oh Lord! Hallejujah!
