This week has been full of loss, but I don't feel down. I lose tennis tryouts yesterday, but feel reinvigorated more than ever to pursue my dreams. Today, our football team blew a 21 point lead and lost in overtime 35-41. Everybody is down except me. I'm happy my 5 dollars is well spent, and am sure we did our best. One of the most enthralling moments of my life.

 

The only thing we were missing during the game was trust. 4th quarter we were down as a crowd while Katella came back. But then we strung the most ridiculous field goal kick blocks, the first penaltied by the biased referee 5 yards further and the second a miraculous tackle. We had it until the very end.

 

So do I.

 

I could never be more proud. More wins to come.
