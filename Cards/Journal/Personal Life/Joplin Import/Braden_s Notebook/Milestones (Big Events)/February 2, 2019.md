I cannot sleep, so instead I shall write. There are so many contests ahead and one could figure it would be from excitement. Yet part of me can only feel powered by an inability to sleep. The mind is more active than ever as it attempts to drown itself away, a pitiful endeavor as fruitless as its own duty.

 

Yet, the mind must train if it's abscess through the production of new material or rather, repurposing of the old-through writing. It is from this reason that I am so grateful to be gifted the pen, for its metaphorical strength makeup for any physical weaknesses. Writing is an archetype of intelligence, which has always been portrayed favorable to strength. But a writer is rarely physically attractive, and it is uncommon for one who is to be strong. This is the irony I cannot fathom, of the power and respect yet lack of beauty a writer often possesses. Intelligence manifests through a channels incomprehensible to the basic senses.

 

Strength is curated through the accretion of muscle and beauty cultivated through makeup, but one cannot communicate intangible beauty when the intangible in a production of the mind and not the universe. How limited we humans are! Perhaps it is for the better.
