Today is Bryce's birthday!

 

Went over to the Boiling Crab today. While waiting, we went to target and started playing with phones. The Pixel 3 and Samsung S10 were super fun! Then, ate the clams and the 2nd batch was superrr tender. Shrimp and mussels were good as well. Yum! Finally topped it all off with a great chocolate cake.

 

I met a guy name Branden today, as the friend of my buddy Rohan. Super chill dude. Showed them the way to the office. Then we had the Mardi Gras festival. What a swell time! Gatsby day was super fun and a good excuse to wear a suit. Then watched a badminton game where Kevin destroyed with Winston haha. After that, we went to Boiling Crab and ate 3 lb shrimp, 1lb mussles and 2lb clams. Clams were so yummy, especially tthe econd batch which was superrr tender. Then, I played tennis with Bryce. I learned how to keep relaxed and relaxed, and let the pelvis do the work. My serve is super deadly. Something about this practice makes me very happy. I'm on my way to varsity!
