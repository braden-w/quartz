What does it mean to have an organized mind? Surely, this is a madder of system rather than action. The system in which I ensconce myself in is what enables me to produce consistent results and make measurable progress. Setting times that are reliable in nature are what drive my education forward. I value my system, and thus spend many days perfecting and practicing it. Though it is far from perfect, it is better than it has ever been. Most importantly, I have to recognize that my time is valuable and I should spend it learning new things.
