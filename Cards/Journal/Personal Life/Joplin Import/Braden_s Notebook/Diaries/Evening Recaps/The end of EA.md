1. Finished Week 6 of Google CSSI. CSSI is officially completed! Learned BSTs and Binary Search Trees

2. Effective Altruism

	1. Shoutouts

	2. Got one from Kasey for depth

	3. Gave one to all the organizers for preparing and asking the right questions.

	4. Got one from Noah Seth, for really pulling my weight and not even being in college yet

1. Got a nice cover for my chair (from a former pillow cover). SO COOL! So much better than a towel, I can actually feel the chair now

2. Played tennis with Bryce at Sierra Madre and played with JR and Michael (college sophomores). We played a great game, my nerve calmed down and I hit some great volleys and serves. A little inconsistent.\~
