Setting Up Mac, Cleaning Room, Joseph's App, Grand…

PM

 

Today has been an amazing day. In the morning, I gathered a bunch of Mac apps and set up a list to take action on in the future. Also bought a dongle and accessories to set up a Mac

 

After that, I cleaned my room. Namely, I moved my Mac to the other side of the room, moved the O lamp to my desk, set up the monitor on the Wooden cabinet, moved the rolling cabinet next to the cabinets, cleared my desk, moved the fruit snacks snugly underneath the purple chair where my backpack is, and cleared all my flash cards.

 

After that, watched Grand Tour with Bryce. Great episode on using GT cards to race across Georgia. The ending was great, as Richard unknowingly told them they would be back to the tent after realizing Bream was a fish.

 

Finally, I fixed Joseph's App! Super amazing that I fixed the document with a super NOVEL solution to rename DocumentID's from default to match the essays ID. This drastically reduced the number of lines of code I needed and allowed me to find by ID instead of using a forEach() loop on a snapshot.

 

1\. Rewrote **\*addEssay\*** to create essay objects with document ID's that match their essay.id

2\. Used document ID's to simplify and speed up search in **\*deleteEssay\*** and **\*finishedEssay\*** methods

3\. **\*applyDropdown\*** now sends payload using aforementioned method

 

I ended up fixing both the delete and dropdown bugs AND sending the payloads to servers.
