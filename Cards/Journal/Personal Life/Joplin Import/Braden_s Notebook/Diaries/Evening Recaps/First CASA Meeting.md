1. CASA Meeting

	1. Michael Chen remembered me from the Yale SoCal Informational Session!

		1. He remarked how he remembered me because my questions were consistently so deep and challenging. He and Allan really appreciated my questions.

		2. It was an info session for the SoCal Yale Alumni Network

	1. Alan remarked that my voice could be on a Podcast. It's very soothing.

		1. I am very flattered. This is not the first time someone has remarked on the soothing nature of my voice.

	<!-- -->

	1. Do you know Joseph Chen? I talked about the story how we met, and how it just so happened that he went to Philips Exeter academy.

	2. Pouring the milk before the cereal

	3. Talking about heights

	4. Imposter syndrome? Failures of a generalist? In Yale, you're the top 99 percentile. When you're comparing people, you're comparing the best of everyone into this super person that you cannot compare to. You don't realize that to the average person, a Yale generalist is a specialist in 5 areas. They can't perceive the difference between 99% and 99.99%. You only see this difference at Yale.

		1. Based on this response, Michael said that I probably took FBLA or DECA.

	1. In Yale, I have learned how to say no to opportunity rather than yes. It's a different game.

Conjoined twin, but not conjoined. So a twin?
