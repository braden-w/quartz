ASB FB Post about Dr. Tung and Successor Meetings, Question Regarding Yvonne's N

Saturday, May 16, 2020

9:09 PM

A friend of mine received an O in Quarter 3 in work habits but N in Quarter 4. She is pretty confident this is due to quarantine assignments and will double check with other students when they receive their report cards; she is far from the most inactive in class. Are teachers allowed to do this?

Â 

The end of the year draws near! Hopefully these two assignments are a breeze for youðŸ¤©

Dr. Tung Tribute \| Due May 22 \| 5 Minutes

Successor Meetings \| Due May 31 \| \~1.5-3 Hours

Please arrange for private meetings with your successors. It is recommended you meet several times to

1\) Cover your successor packets

2\) Plan goals

3\) Any Q&A

These can be casual discussions that ease your successor into their new positions. Check off the corresponding three checkmarks in our document:

Â 

Class councils have freedom to choose who and how they meet. I will be checking at the end of the month, so please find time to complete this by May 31.
