Birthday, Morning Ride (Learned w/out Hands), Pete…

PM

Today was my birthday! A wonderful morning ride with dad, Bryce, and Peter. I learned how to ride without hands!! During the ride, I talked with Peter about advancement and getting a board meeting in Troop 2131. We discussed various methods of how to negotiate and speak in a manner that brings you closer together towards an agreement. I gave a lot of great advice that dad approved of!

 

Afterwards, I had the first TA meeting with the Algorithmic Toolbox Coursera course! Lots of great advice, among them: Message Masters Students, Leetcode, Hackathons, Applying, Studying for an A over A-, Networking (Sending an email to professors in freshman year). Really great advice from everyone!

 

I have received many Birthday wishes. Among them, a message from Yvonne with many images and caps. We have so many great memories together.

 

Afterwards, had a bike ride with Andre over. Gave him a popscicle and had a great time. Our ride was amazing. After the ride, Andre gave me a really nice accordion birthday card with a $20 Steam Gift Card and we hung out at my room and watched some YouTube videos (he really enjoyed JoshDub) and talked about deep topics, ranging from prioritization to wealth to to EA to Yale vs. Stanford to BLM. WE BOTH FOUND EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM! I found that to be so funny.

 

Bryce was talking about how Mr. Shu was talking about how some people were spending their stimulus checks on the stock market. We talked about the bubble, and the quote "The world giveth and the world taketh away". I LOLed at that quite with Bryce.

 

Afterwards, had a delicious dinner from New Fusion. Delicious fried squid, sweet and sour chicken, fish, beef, and chow mein. I was so tired after that!

 

Haters gonna say it's fake. Filmed my automated Humanbenchmark bot and posted on Instagram, with scheming weasel and OOOO as the audio track.

 

Afterwards, I had a crazy high realization about He/him/his vs. She/her and talked to Bryce about it. He typed down He/him/his on his screen to sort it out. It was a real o shit moment.
