# Legislative Victory + Working Late Night on 230
Thursday, September 17, 2020

7:31 PM

 

Hey guys, big dubs came in this week! Been corresponding with the HCC president/HoCollege to get your suggestions through. :)

 

In addition to the inflatable sofas, we've gotten the pool tables reopened down in the buttery. New decorations for the courtyard are on their way (extra chairs, tables, and sports sets). Fairy lights are already planned for later this year, as it is a yearly tradition (Morse just put theirs up early)

 

Feel free to dm me more suggestions! Enjoy watching these changes come in. Also movie night this Saturday at 2PM :)

 

 

Working with Andrew and David late at night at their suite. It was a great vibe. We were working hard to get \#3 and \#6 done. I astonished myself in getting 3 and 6 all by myself with some prompts from David! Afterwards, we called it a night late at 3AM and talked about many different topics.
