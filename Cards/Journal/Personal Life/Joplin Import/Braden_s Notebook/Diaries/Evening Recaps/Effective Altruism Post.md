Hey everyone! I’m a first-year but I just wanted to share a club that I’ve been really involved with recently and believe may be worth your time. :)

 

If you love deep and long-form conversations, specifically about ethics, technology, AI risk, global poverty, priorities research, public policy, pandemic preparedness, climate change, nuclear security, or other existential cause areas, consider stopping by Yale Effective Altruism!

 

Our mission is to answer one question: how can we use our resources to help others the most? In joining us, you won’t just gain exposure to consistently deep and lasting conversations (nothing breaks the ice more than talking about existential threats :P), but a community that stretches across all backgrounds, including philosophy, political science, tech, finance, and more, working together to identify and solve the most impactful cause areas of today.

 

They’re running a fellowship (which is essentially an hour-long deep discussion seminar per week) that’s open until September 12!
