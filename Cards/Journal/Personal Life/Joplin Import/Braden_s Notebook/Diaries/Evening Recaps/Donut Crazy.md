1. Breakfast from Donut Crazy. COVID Testing. Then watched HLTV FaZe vs. Niko. The back to back nature of everything was very satisfying.

2. Career discussion with 80k Hours. Tech Congress.

3. Cleaned my room as professor Kagan delivered lecture. All the trash was taken out, and then afterwards, followed it with a pretty lengthy discussion.

4. Going out with Kevin.

	1. We grabbed some Crepes outside. Afterwards, we ran into Sebastian and Yigit. We walked around, talked, then hung out in the Hopper buttery.

	2. Afterwards, Yigit escorted us and showed us around Branford. We met Mahesh there! It is incredibly regal there. We visited the library and some dorms. Yigit played the accordion and Andrew explained to us how he got a 5 on the AP Spanish exam. Both were incredibly funny stories!

	3. We then convened with Cam Greene and went to stacks. We talked about various things about 230, technology, as we explored the warehouse. Afterwards, we returned to the Hopper library and eagerly watched Kevin and Cam duke it out on chess. It was so funny as Andrew and Kevin consulted out loud and Kevin got demolished.

	1. Reflected on our favorite Violin concertos, what we will do during break, etc.
