In responding to the interview, I was quite surprised by the nature of the questions, especially given the topic was Diet & Lifestyle. I did not know that the central theme of the interview was the treatment of animals until it began.

 

In applying several social dynamic principles:

1\. I may experience cognitive dissonance with some of my answers, especially in aftermath of the interview. Reintroducing these ideas into my daily life may cause me to make different decisions and consider the effects on animals to a greater extent. This is an example of pre-decision cognitive dissonance.

2\. Given that this is an online interview, there is less of the social judgement and/or first impression to make on the interviewer. This is interesting, as from the video conducted by the hiring manager, the importance of a first impression can be crucial. This element was nonexistent during the interview. To some extent, the removal of a face allows me to be more honest with my answer for fear of being judged.

3\. Of course, no interview is without bias. I believe I made several answers out of the desire to "fit in" or be perceived well by the interviewer. This would be an example of response bias during the interview.

4\. The framing of the interview was non-biased, similar to the police interview video we watched earlier in the video. The fact that I am able to see both my answers and the interviewer's questions, not just one or the other, keeps the discussion balanced.

5\. The chat bubble and "development" of the interviewer's questions are "salient" and provide stimulus to the discussion.

 

To me, the questions were sensitive but not uncomfortable or offending. There is no judgement attached to the wording of most questions (except one regarding killing animals when there was an alternative), and the fact that the interviewer is a bot is quite reassuring.

 

This interview was far from a proper representation of an in-person one (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but important to consider nevertheless). First, to condense the number of possible outcomes for the interviewer to respond to, my response is limited to a simple dropdown menu. There was a very clear direction that the interview went, which may or may not have been preplanned. However, the biggest missing element is the presence of judgement (\#2), which is appreciated. It is easier to answer sensitive questions when done electronically rather than directly to a person. However, this also raises the question-why set up a "virtual interview" when it is equally effective to have a simple electronic form?

 

Ultimately, my suggestion for the electronic interview is to break out of this middle ground between responsive electronic chatbot and static web form. It is more efficient to have participants fill out a simple form, and it is far more interesting if the chatbot could be programmed to respond to web input. While the current implementation is fun and definitely more engaging than a form, I would prefer the form to a certain extent, or a more fleshed-out application.
