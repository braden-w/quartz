College Ivy Day

Today is a big day as the college reveal day. I have spent a great deal preparing and learning in this break, and though it did not help my application, I becoming a better person has prepared me for the news. I wish to thank everyone on my journey, including Hatheway, Mynster, Tung, and my family. There is a lot to do, with so many different possibilities. Time will tell what the outcome God wishes to be.

 

I GOT INTO YALE!!
