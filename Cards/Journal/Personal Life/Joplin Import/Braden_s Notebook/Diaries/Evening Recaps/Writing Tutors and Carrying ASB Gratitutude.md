There is a long silence as he holds the pistol, fingers wavering. The main character Charles must abandon his family in order to discover his culture and visit a new land. At least that is what it appears the story suggests. The main theme is that in order to find out who he is, he can join another group of people who are ultimately powerful, the creators. But he doesn't know if he should go for it or not. He thinks of his wife and his daughter, the strawberries, and everything else they loved to eat. These are simple pleasures that they must eat and enjoy. There is an inevitable decline of nations, as well, to fit with the theme of the later article, Let It Happen. It is absolutely amazing in order for him to discover and find more about his history, and backstory. There are cuts to the girl who loved Raspberries and terrestrial fruits. Or at least, he must leave her in order to get it going. I'm not sure. I'll search it up. I'm about to search up plot ideas on the internet in order to further drive this quest for a story. A list of 100 sounds great. I will gain inspiration from that topic.

Last night I didn't have many dreams but I slept late at around 1:30! I was busy eating Chex Mix with Bryce and watching Dunkey and Cinemasins and BTD Battles with him. It was fun to watch all these games and movies and take a hiatus from the pen. There is something great about writing that makes me want to get back at it again, however. Yesterday's session with Jeffrey was nothing short of spectacular. His feedback and ideas were truly phenomenal and invested so much time in order to make me a better person. I can only say that I hope for the same with my other tutors today. I hope I do get to talk to the Harvard and the Texas grad in order to further perfect some of my writing and voice. Their feedback would mean the world to me. I am also getting used to the directness in which they speak, which allows me to have a growth mindset and tackle change. This is only to the advantage of me. Today, I can't wait to polish my essays: specifically, Honeybunch, Ark, and I Never Asked for This. They each have potential and I know that a good idea is in me someday. Perhaps I will now move everything into the Scholastics portal and await further instructions. That would help my case out admirably. I do wish I could help pack Mistletoe today; it seems fun to play around with all the scouts and talk and jest. Jaidon's dad is incredibly kind and bought donuts while Jaidon is incredibly fun to just talk to and be around. He mentioned how Sky tells him that I'm carrying ASB, which I am grateful to hear of my impact for this organization.
