Journey Begins

No dreams last night but I have been giving greater consideration of my appearance, for some odd reason. The biggest activities that can benefit me at the current moment is pursuing scholarships, exercising well, and studying regularly. Grateful for this opportunity to start at a new day and to get so much sleep. I am focused on developing a strong dedication to my morning ritual, looking dapper, and hitting my next growth spurt. The one thing that is paramount to complete today is to finish updating all colleges and study for tests tomorrow.

Â 

By all other metrics, I am on track to become a star student. After all, it is loyalty to a process that drives me to success. I am reliving the moments of years ago, when consistency in elementary school built me into an academic powerhouse and I shall do the same starting now.
