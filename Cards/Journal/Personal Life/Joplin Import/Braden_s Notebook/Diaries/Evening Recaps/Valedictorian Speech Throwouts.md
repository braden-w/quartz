Accomplishments don't make you special

I wish you all failure -&gt; so you can succeed in learning.

Lose it all -&gt; so you can learn to gain it back.

After all, nothing is more fleeting nor ephemeral than life itself.

In the end, it is personal self motivation that set the bar. In the school where everyone is insanely unique talents, but not everyone has the same motives either.

Indelible Mark on Nation's History

We remember not because we lost, but because we won

We afraid of failureâ€¦.no just success. We're afraid to be different or same if different is the norm

Things we don't want to do. If we knew studying in advance would help us save 5 hours of sleep before the test, we would take it. But we can't see into the future, treat it the same though

Empathy

Arcadia has a culture for being efficient. My challenge to all of you is to not just be efficient, but empathetic. Give love and passion away like no other, and it will be little time before it will come back full circle

Do not let success be the blindfold for more success. It's okay to want more, but not to settle. Valedictorians are often too conservative and aren't the most successful.

Think long term =&gt; the sooner the better
