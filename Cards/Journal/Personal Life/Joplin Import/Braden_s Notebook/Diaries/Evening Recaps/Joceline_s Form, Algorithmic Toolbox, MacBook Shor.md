no bye lol

Other:

Â 

do you have anything to say to me \*

really enjoy talking with you; ur really weird sense of humor and the way u crack jokes with your low gravelly laugh is a straight vibe. I only know one other person who has a similar personality and is as fun to talk to as you, honestly I miss that

Â 

also happy early birthday and 4th ^o^ you're a good person Joceline and if u ever forget i'm always here to remind u XD we should talk again someday. does this give u enough validation HAðŸ¤ª

Â 

Completed Algorithmic Toolbox with weeks 5 and 6! Grinded that hard and very happy I finished it.

Â 

Meanwhile, I added some shortcuts to my MacBook. Really great productivity machine!

Â 

Call with Frank and Evelyn. I absolutely destroyed. Very great points on giving cash to the poor (the problem is not inequality, but cash).

Â 

Overall, great day. The form from Joceline was quite interesting ahaha. Nothing much has to come from it, I had a great time filling it out albeit cringily.
