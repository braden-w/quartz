Valorant with the BOYS

PM

 

Today, I played some amazing Valorant with the boys.

 

1. Played a solo game, and then two games with Will, Jason, and Raymond. It was great fun! I was top fragging in the first two and mid fragging in the last one.

2. Completed First problem of week 3 of Data Structures.

3. Call with Data Structures class. "Dude, you have interview-level questions. Great questions."

4. Networked with Pleasant Pranav after class. He dmed me on instagram.

5. EA meeting, had a discussion about careers.
