Today, let's brainwrite about the essence of what we must write about. There are many genre's for today's orders of the day: personal memoir, humor, poetry, and science fiction. Let's go by them step by step, shall we?

 

Personal Memoir

 

My grandmother is reliant on others to produce her identity. She is unable to remember the simplest things, yet somehow manges to remember the things that matter. In her frienzied craze, scared shitless over what we are doing to her, she is still somehow reassured that everything will be okay. Or at least, I wish she did. It's nearly impossible to tell at times with this woman. However, I assume she is going to be alright. She feels on a level that is unlike any other. As I write and take in this metaphorical Starbucks cafe, I am reminded of the lived ones that I deeply cherish and care about. Will they ever care for me, though?
I love you, Grandma.
I just wanted to let you know in case you ever forget. Keep this note with you forever, amid the destruction of time and mayhem of whatever life you are pursuing at the moment. I care too deply for you to not wish any better for you.
Perhaps it is some foolish thing to write if you arer unable to read. Love is foolish, is it not? For it is one thing to be clueless as you, yet to be foolish as I. I do hope and wish you the best in these next few years. There is nothing but love and fruitful ambition in the moments weaved together into immaculate moments.
What do you call someone who knows everything except themself? To know the identity of every single person around you except the one? Grandma might know, or she might not. I'm starting to not care as us anymore.

 

My grandfather recites our ages. My dad can't even remember our ages at times. That's quite humorous.

 

There are no perks to being whitewashed. Caught in the middle of two cultures, it seems, yet not just two but an infinite number. I watch as my friends lose their mother tongues and laugh. Mine has been lost long ago in the atlantic.
Ten years ago I was bullied for not knowing Chinese. They laughed at me, hurled insults at me in Chinese that I wouldn't understand, and mock my efforts in Chinese school.
The story of humans is really interesting. Cast out from their own clans from the trees, they were forced to adapt as ground animals. Teamwork became integral. Language became essential. Humanity became what it is today. I like humans. I wonder why.
Force a facade. Yes, go ahead and study more math, just like the other Asians. Go and write for hours until your fingers bleed from pressing the blade into the paper, hoping that one scratch will be the one that makes you or breaks you. Try to turn the one language you know into a strength. Yes, go ahead and learn five more progarmming languages, hoping it will turn you into into something respectable. You do you. You know best.
Everyone loves a story of a battle. Watch the immigrant lose their culture. Nobody wants to deal with the aftermath. Well here's the story: my great-grandparents came to America, searching opportunity and facing immense prejudice. A yellow in a sea a white. Now, I face prejudice among the new: a white among the sea of yellow.
Where did everyone else go? Did the whites go to China.
What would happen if everyone in China now lived in America and everyone in America lived in China? Same government structure, same everything else. I'm not sure if the result would be desirable.
Ten years later, any excuse is accepted with wholeheartedness. While my friends are forgetting their mother tongues and drown themselves in the tears of the forgotten, mine was lost years ago in the Atlantic, tears mixed with the salt stings of the ocean.
Perhaps it is better to not lose so much. I already having lost so much, I have nothign to lose but everything to gain.
The human condition is pliable. I think about human chimps, their evolution bringing the start of something new. Culture must be lost.
Someday, I dream what it's like to immigrate back to China. My mother has already discouraged me from that idea. Immediate stigma. Several mor egenerations, and all family history will be lost. There will be nothing left except a new Chinese family, starting from day one.
I take a deep breath, and close my eyes. I wish my family could afford to go to China. I wish the heavens would part ways and knowledge would come beaming through the sky, into my little head.
Forget what I said earlier. This is no end of some crazy life, but the start of something new.

 

Science Fiction

The main protaonist loves his family. Or perhaps, he doesn't. Either way, he comes from an incredibly distraught and shaky background. He imagines what the Flood did to his family, and everyone that he loved. He must bargain with Noah, the gatekeeper of humanity's technology. Noah is at the greatest side of the bargain. After all, what could Noah possible need that he doesn't have already? I must recall that my theme is of immigration and moving around
