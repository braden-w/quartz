Opening Scholastics Art and Writing

Tuesday, March 16, 2021

7:49 PM

Today is the day that Scholastics Art and Writing comes out. I am about to open the results. First, however, I will make a detailed plan of all three possible outcomes.

 

1\. Gold Medal

\- Rejoice

\- Email Ms. Hatheway the good news

\- Be grateful for this opportunity

2\. Silver Medal

\- Rejoice

\- Email Ms. Hatheway the good news

\- Be grateful for this opportunity

3\. Nothing

\- Be grateful for this opportunity, remembering that not everyone gets to have the opportunity to compete on the national stage

\- Make this a learning opportunity for the future in nerves for announcements (turn into excitement!)

\- Add this to my Pauses on Successes

 

I didn't get anything. Better luck next time!
