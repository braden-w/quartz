Hello George, thank you so much for the kind words! I am committing to Yale University this fall. If I do get into Harvard for grad school, it will be among my top choices ðŸ˜Š

It is truly awesome to be speaking with you, let alone having you visit my blog. Your name has not left AHSâ€”you are a legend among my friends and I for your feats in Intel STS and as a valedictorian (among many others)! Thank you very much for reaching out to me, it made my day and I wish you the bestðŸ˜Š)
