To me, the Hugo Reid Scholarship is not about me or my accomplishments, but about my journey as a student and celebrating the figures who shaped me into who I am today. Mrs. Jilizian, Mrs. Halberstadt, Ms. Clark, Mrs. Cheng—these are not only names, but mentors who have helped me find my interests, discover a love for learning, and become part of the Hugo Reid family.

Thank you, Mrs. Jilizian, for providing a fun-filled classroom in 2nd grade where I met my best friend, and for encouraging me to pursue math and writing—which have remained my favorite subjects ever since. It was thanks to you that I learned that "you go read, at Hugo Reid", began seriously reading, and aimed for the accelerated readers (AR Test) leaderboard every month. All that reading really came in handy when I entered creative writing competitions in high school.

Thank you, Mrs. Halberstadt, for providing a warm community in 4th grade with special moments I will never forget—the day I won the raffle and was teacher for the day, the cheerful "Yes, Ma'am"'s during homework checks, and all the times you brought your son to class so I could help him with his college math class. Your class inspired me to join peer tutoring in middle and high school, taught me compassion, and emboldened me to take AP Calculus in 9th grade to pursue higher-level math.

Thank you, Ms. Clark, for musical theater in 4th and 5th grade, where I had the opportunity to learn to sing and dance, be a leading actor, and gain confidence to perform in front of a stage. I will cherish all those early morning wakeups, line memorizing, and extra practices—"You Never Know" and Scott and his Pickled Cherries will forever live in my heart.

Thank you, Mrs. Cheng, for everything—the special worksheets, after-school vocabulary sessions, robotics challenges, delicious spaghetti—and the most wonderful 3rd and 5th grade experiences. I am so grateful to have had you for two years. You always made us feel special and provided just the right amount of challenge in the classroom; there was always something new and exciting to do. I will remember 5th grade forever—playing Emperor Penguin in the Holiday Show "How the Penguins Saved Christmas", dancing to "Treasure" in the 5th Grade Talent Show, playing Scott in Musical Theater, taking the Johns Hopkins CTY Spatial Battery test, spending hours talking about science with my friends during recess, going on exciting field trips, and creating countless memories with you and all my friends.

Thank you, Hugo Reid, for 6 years of unforgettable memories. You have been the place for my firsts—where I had my first stage performance, touched my first violin, had my first student council position, wrote my first essay, took my first test, won my first presidency—all of which I have continued in high school. At Yale, I plan to major in the Economics & Computer Science joint major with a possible second major in Mechanical Engineering or Data Science and Statistics. Continuing my Hugo Reid journey, I will continue to sing and dance in their performing arts programs and explore their writing and mathematics departments. As I do, I will carry with me the communities, mentors, and memories that I made at Hugo Reid, which I will look back to fondly and forever.\*\*\*END OF FILE\*\*\*I will forever remember 2013 as the year that will live in
