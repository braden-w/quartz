The Day After Homecoming Day

I am empathetic. I am driven. I am gritty.

 

Grateful for yesterday's hype, for it made me fear that there was an uprising/cleavage within ASB. However, that is not the case, and in addition, reconsidering my position, I am in absolute control. I am grateful for the lessons this experiences taught me.

 

1. Finish Editing Dave's Letter

2. Finish PS

3. Send PS and Letters to Upenn

 

I will send my statements to my colleagues TODAY at 10 PM in my room.
