The natural surroundings of humans have often been subject to introspection and reflection. However, while many may idolize nature for its beauty, others see negative patterns that echo human behavior in the natural world. Oliver senior, his 2005 Poem "Plants", assumes the role of an enlightened intellectual warning others of their insidious nature. Through accessible imagery, he draws comparisons to how plants are highly mechanized and militaristic and should be avoided to his audience.

 

Throughout the poem, Senior draws comparisons of plant life to military strategy, suggesting their reproduction is an invasion that should be repulsed.

 

Another weapon in Senior's arsenal is his structure and syntax. Increasingly, he turns to enjambments and overflowing stanzas such as "imperialistic/grand design" (8-9). The overflowing nature of this flow overwhelms the reader and mimics the invasion he describes.
