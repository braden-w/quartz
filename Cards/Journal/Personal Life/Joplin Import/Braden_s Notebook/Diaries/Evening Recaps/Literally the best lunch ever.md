# Literally the Best Lunch Ever
Sunday, August 30, 2020

1:05 PM

1. Morning Workout

2. Picked up breakfast on the way to the library. Ended up socializing in the tables/courtyard with a bunch of people. Watched Oleksii, Roberro, and Carson play lacrosse and then frisbee

3. Studied in the Library with Gabe, Bilal, and me. Completed Yale EA Assignment, classes, etc.

4. Grabbed lunch. Bacon, String Beans, Tomatoes, Poached Egg, and Beans. SO DELICIOUS! Yale feeds us so well.

5. Community Values with Yvonne

 1. I hope the Yale community offers diversity of thought and trains us how to navigate difficult topics rather than avoid them.

 2. I would like to connect within our residential college and afterwards, with other residential colleges. A goal would be a study group that can endure long-distance 2nd semester.

 3. Reduction of social interaction from COVID. There is no exact solution except to make the best of what we have and especially in 1st semester

 4. Two areas of improvement I wanted to work on: FOMO, and finishing sentences in my head before speaking (from Impromptu speaking). Shreya also did Impromptu gang gang

1. One-on-one conversation Yvonne

 1. Dad heard the whole conversation and enjoyed it

 2. Econ 170 is really easy and so if I am to take a 5th (dad recommends just take 4), it would be 170

 3. Modified my Mac notification settings so I get notifications from Slack and Discord

1. Icebreakers at Oxford

 1. I'm very lucky to study EPE (PPE is the major of politicians in England)

 2. When were you happiest? Right now - Although perhaps the slice has shrunk, the pie has increased, and I have been exposed to a greater share of emotions than previously

 3. I'm very lucky that Yale has handled COVID well so far

1. Cleaned up the room with the boys. Gabe came in clutch and had already thrown out the trash. I vacuumed and wiped the common room and my room.

2. Zoom Essentials for first years. William An had met Lisza Lo in a program at USC.

3. Ate dinner outside in the courtyard. First with Gabe and Andrew, then met with Madison, Izzy, Evelyn, Danny, Carolyn, and Alexandro again.

4. First Year Dinner! Pizza was delicious!

5. Finished Lincoln in Thought and Action homework

6. Froco Call. Swapped with Sam's group, then rejoined with Yvonne.

7. Got an email from the Dean regarding someone climbing the roof

8. Early bedtime. Called parents and slept at 9:15pm
