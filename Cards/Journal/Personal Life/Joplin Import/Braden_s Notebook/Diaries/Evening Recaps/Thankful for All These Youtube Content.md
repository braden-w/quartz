Thankful for All These Youtube Content

Today, I am grateful for all of the recent developments I have discovered in great YouTube Content with my brother and Yale. These discoveries have led to great experiences lounging in my room, snacking on chips, and relaxing to videos while working in the background. 3 big things to tackle right now are the scholarships, maintaining my daily chedule, and finishing new projects. Russian Badger, Soviet Womble, Vanoss, Boffy, and Dream.
