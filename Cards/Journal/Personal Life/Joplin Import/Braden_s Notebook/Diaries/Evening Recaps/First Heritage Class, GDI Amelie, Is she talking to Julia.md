# First Heritage Class, GDI Amelie, Is She Talking to Julia
Thursday, September 3, 2020

5:00 PM

 

1. First lecture of Heritage Chinese. It was somewhat difficult, as half the class was spoken in Chinese. However, I was able to follow and introduce myself. I talked to the teacher, Chan Laoshi afterwards and she decided I was in the middle. All the practice with mom worked! I am very grateful to be bestowed this opportunity.

2. Talk with Professor Kagan after lecture. I brought up the idea of value lexicality, which stems from the idea that azzzzz is still better than baaaaaa.

3. Lunch: Chicken Tenders, with Shervin. Shervin asked me who was sitting across Julia. I said Jack. Is he talking to Julia? Is he gay? I told him yeah, and we dapped up. It was a funny moment. Afterwards, I moved to Justin's group and ate.

4. Call with Wang Laoshi. She explained that being surrounded by heritage speakers could be a great community of similar background. I really like talking to her. Her enthusiasm for the subject is so refreshing!

5. Dinner

	1. Amelie approached our group and I started talking. Told my story of student council in middle school and high school. I went full big chi and definitely exuded confidence while talking. Among my lines, there was

		1. Sorry I left early, you know I'm just shy :)

		2. Crazy Rich Asian - Asian = Crazy Asian? Oh so you're a crazy asian?

		3. Random fun facts

	1. Amelie dmed me afterwards asking if I was going to the basement. I responded no, how can I make it up? &lt;3 I played my cards really well.

	2. Dmed Jack and called my parents. I laughed in my dorm for a good while. This is such a shitty but good problem to have.
