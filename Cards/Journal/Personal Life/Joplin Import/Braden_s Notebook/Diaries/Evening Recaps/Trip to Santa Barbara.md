Trip to Santa Barbara

Amazon bike trip with Peter and my family. Rode bikes around UC Santa Barbara, listened to podcasts, and had delicious In N Out afterwards.

 

Played some piano. Almost done with Dearly Beloved!

 

Watched Ocean's Eleven with the family. It was so amazing! Really enjoyed the SWAT Team twist, I was laughing so hard.
