DMV Permit Again/Real ID, Breakdown, Algorithmic Toolbox LinkedIn, Finished Brave New World, Discovered Pursuit of Wonder, Peacock During Walk

After a particularly strange dream, I applied for a credit card and was denied today due to a lack of a real ID. Afterwards, I had a nervous breakdown about choosing Yale over Stanford, and the possibility of having the choice. Mom comforted me and things alleviated.

 

LinkedIn review with Algorithmic Toolbox after the breakdown. They really liked the flex, to the point that I was embarrassed.

 

Afterwards, I read Brave New World as I visited the DMV for an ID. I decided to get a permit while I was there and passed! Upon coming back home, I discovered Pursuit of Wonder and some interesting videos. In particular, the one about the right choice

 

During my walk, I met a peacock that was rather docile.
