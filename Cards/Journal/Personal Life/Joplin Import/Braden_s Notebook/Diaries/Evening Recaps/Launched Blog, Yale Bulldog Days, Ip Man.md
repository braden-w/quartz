I am organized.

 

I am grateful to have begun my blog in the past few weeks, adjusted by seat headrest, and achieved something big every day. Yale Bulldog Days has been absolutely amazing, and Nasser's help in sharing resources and helping me achieve course planning is something I am so grateful for. Yale is an absolutely amazing school that I am delighted to attend. Ip man has been a brilliant film to watch.

 

Today, I am most concerned about making plans for ASB. I will achieve what I need to achieving through organizing deadlines and planning meetings with cabinet with the rest of ASB. I value concistency. Let's make this a habit and keep up my streaks.
