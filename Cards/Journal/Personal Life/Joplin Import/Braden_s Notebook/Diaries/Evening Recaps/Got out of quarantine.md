# Got Out of Quarantine
Wednesday, November 18, 2020

Â 

1. Talk about Genius. Interesting duck and bunny photo rotation on Zoom call.

2. Ate some grilled cheese sandwiches. They were delicious! We talked about the bass pro shop and Florida lakes.

3. Watched the Harvard Yale Roast Off. It was okay. But it was wonderful to watch it with Grace Hopper, us in a circle listening to everything.

4. Started showering with earbuds. Heard a program about improving empathy tactically.

5. Call with Kat. We talked about partying, Caleb's, and other insecurities. What about this situation makes you feel this way?

	1. There are people who would like this problem of missing out. The fact that we are sad about missing out on opportunity is a privilege.
