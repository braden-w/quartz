Today, I laughed the most I ever had in ages.

1. Watched Mr. Incredible gets blasted by a JDAM missile. HILARIOUS I LAUGHED SO HARD. Watching the burning UP house and the incredimobile was so funny. Bryce and I laughed the most we've ever had.

2. Nicole posted a beach post on Instagram. Oh my gosh, she's so pretty.

3. Mom made me a delicious beef tendon noodle soup. Noodles were so thin and delicious! Ate 4 tea eggs for breakfast

4. Watched Na'vi and new Astralis in CSGO tournament

5. Walked with mom and played Valorant with the boys.
