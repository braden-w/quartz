# Heritage Chinese, the Best Lunch Ever, Hearing a Strange Discussion
Wednesday, September 2, 2020

3:30 PM

1. Literally the best lunch I've ever had: Beef brisket, macaroni, beans

	1. Said happy birthday to Grandpa and hello

<!-- -->

1. Overheard some discussion about men vs. women

	1. Guy was trying to explain guys to women

	2. Men are thirsty af, sex is a drug, etc.

<!-- -->

1. During my meeting with Wang Laoshi, she recommended that I take Heritage Chinese since I have intuition with tones.

	1. My whole schedule was going to be rearranged, but thank you Math 230 for being flexible and allowing me room in my schedule!

	2. Called mom and said hi :) We talked Chinese etc.

	3. I'm super excited. I finished my reading and writing and listening comprehension tests. I got over 50% on listening which is pretty lit.

<!-- -->

1. Dinner with Justin, Suba, Shreya, etc.

	1. Justin offered me some extra socks, thank you bro

<!-- -->

1. Dumped recycling with Gabe and visited basement. Aaron called me Ryan for the 3rd time. I whiffed my hair and said "Hey, my name is Braden, but you can call me Ryan like everyone else."

2. Froco call on sexual assault, Duty call watch party on Rockets vs. Thunder. Talked as I lied down for sleep about ethics. Yvonne mentioned how we just talked for 90 minutes on ethics with Carly.
