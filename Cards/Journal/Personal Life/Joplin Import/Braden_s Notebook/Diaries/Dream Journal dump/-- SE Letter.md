# SE Letter
SE, I am at both peace and at war with myself
I'm not emotional and yet at the same time very
Never have I ever felt so tarnished for a decision and regretted it so immensely
And in the past few years I couldn't help but feel the tide change away and grow ever so distant
Drowning as I drifted from a life I had secretly longed yet never sought
While seeking a life I knew
I could not help but notice the changes in your life reflect
Comments and posts disappear, cautious replies awaiting
Preserve the dignity I thought I had that I still mistakenly defend now

The point of return had been reached and yet the time had been now or never

I go for a gamble I thought I was ready to lose

And yet I could never be angry at you but only seek to empathize and understand

Sometimes I wish I knew why. Perhaps you were embarrassed by me; or maybe gained interest in another person, or surrounded yourself with others that made you strong and independent

All the same happened to me

And yet in amidst every wave there was a trough and every trough I realize

You are the only one who I've ever truly liked

The way our personalities clanged so acrimoniously

The way I could never understand you and you the other way around

And yet now I understand everything

I have only grown to be a little bit smarter, a little less nerdy, and a little bit taller

But within this growing body are feelings that have never changed

Time will tell if that will change but I am not sure it will anytime soon

And I know now that change has blessed you have gotten over me but I will never forget

And if there is no potential for feelings to change I need to know one way or another

Nothing you say could ever make me feel less comfortable

I may be hurt and yet I could never raise a thought against you and only like you more

I could never ask you to do something that I

For making me tougher and more courageous in spite of past mistakes to a near-assured failure

And yet if the answer is yes the story only continues to an increasingly uncertain yet exciting future

And yet if there is none and I

But gosh my greatest concern is that I'm being being needy

I am not needy

And every answer only enhances my being

And no matter how you feel or what the answer is always know that I will always have some thought or feeling whenever I recall the memories

Always know

And always know thank you, for being the inspiration and fire I needed in my life that always rang through. We had a helluva run, and even if you I can

Please don't feel embarrassed, but be proud

You changed my life forever and dammit I actually would still be a real nerd if it weren't for yo

And yet I can feel the pressure I do not wish to inflict oh God and I have no idea where it lies between excruciating pain or mild annoyance

And fuck my feelings please let me know how I can help you

I can disappear forever from you and never feel a twinge of regret if it would make you feel better

Or not embarrass you and stay invisible from your friends

I dont expect a change in heart

I'm asking you to shoot me in the heart without a twinge of regret if it'll let me get the message finally

Because all of my life had built to a climax I missed and receded without me ever understanding how

Tell me how and pull the trigger and I will never forget the message

And so I was wondering

He'll je parle francais parce qu√©

Kill my dreams if there's no chance ever

Maybe to you I'm one out of twenty but to me you're one

I will always be open to knowing where you are or ended up

Heck I don't even need a relationship we can be friends

And so if for any sense

I know for the most part these years you've been playing on my terms so for these next few I know I will play on yours

And if some day you ever have a change in mind feel free to let me know whenever and I'll always be down to catch up, no matter what

I'll play on your terms

Just know that if you ever need support or help or anyone to rant and

I'll always be here to help

You don't have to call me (but some part wishes you will)

Though feelings fade and stuff I know that what you feel is beyond my control

But what is is how I can be present

I'll always be here

Because I knew back then

And if you have must tell the truth then feel no need to feel anything besides my support

Maybe you doubt my faith or
