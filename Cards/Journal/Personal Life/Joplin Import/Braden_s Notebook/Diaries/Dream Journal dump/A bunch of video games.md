# A Bunch of Video Games
A bunch of video games

CS:GO with the boys. Played cache with the USP, hit a bunch of clean headshot flicks.

Star Wars Total War. Battle against Darth Vader. Padme brought 1500 stormtroopers as captive, and she left. Darth Vader then ordered to kill them.

Then outside, a star wars calvary battle took place under an overpass. Darth Vader was coming, so we called out to summon dragons, moved 2 cannons and dragon outside the underpass to shoot.

Then a siege, Clash Royale style, took place. Royale recruits were grappling up and down the castle, and a knight was walking up the steps. Then we won. Sunflowers made a siege and started pecking at a center circle.
