# By the Pier, Sleeping Long, Scarlet and Caltech
By the Pier, Sleeping Long, Scarlet and Caltech

 

Had a dream that I had switched the places of my Macbook and External monitor so that the monitor was in the center and computer to the side. There was a murder in my dream that I fearfully was trying to solve.

 

Had a dream that I was walking by the Pier. Met Scarlet. Walked around a brick red campus

 

Our base had been destroyed, and so we tortured the survivors. We tried to contain them but we only had 3 people and they had 4, so it was a struggle.
