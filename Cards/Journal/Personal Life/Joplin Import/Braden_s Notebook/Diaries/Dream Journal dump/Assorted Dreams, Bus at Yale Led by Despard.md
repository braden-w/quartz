# Assorted Dreams, Bus at Yale Led by Despard
Assorted Dreams, Bus at Yale Led by Despard

 

Iron Man said that Spider Man doesn't realize his actual ability, for better or for worse.

 

Had a dream that Mr. Despard was driving a bus around Yale. I saw Scarlet to the side and had a side dream about it. The song "Just like Magic" played and I had random visualizations.

 

Nature documentary, and the difference between a gorilla and human baby. Dad laughed, and remarked that the difference was obvious. I couldn't understand and so I ended up not applying.

 

Akeel remarked about how he recycled back bottles near an airplane.

 

Ran while holding a tennis basket to Hugo Reid courts and slightly beyond on Michilinda before turning around and running back. Then realized it was time to go, not at 4:30 AM like Bryce on the calendar, but 7:30 AM.
