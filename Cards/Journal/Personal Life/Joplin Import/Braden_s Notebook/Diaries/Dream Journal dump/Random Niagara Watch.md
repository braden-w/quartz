Random Niagara Watch

 

Had I dream that I went at the top of the Niagara falls/Himalaya, looking up to the sky, and then glanced at my watch on my left hand (analog with hands sticking out of my arm quite a bit). Following that, it was effortless love.

 

Grandpa move to quiz location and chairs and coughing. I had a dream that Hainan was at Niagara, playing basketball and there was this person named Julia. There were a ton of fish in the pond and then fish in stacked tanks near this room. At the retirement home, there was a guy to help with grandpa's cough but actually it was a test.

 

Because every man needs depression and sadness in their daily life. Likened it to birds with their beaks filled with honey. Except that has been done before and when birds do, they go bars shit. Teacher laughs and says, no, jacking off enough times won't fix your depression.

 

We then ran downstairs to quarantine in the basement. Sofia talked about a sex toy she had since she was 10 and had to hide.
