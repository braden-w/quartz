# Giant Stage Speech, Bloods and Crips, Brosnam Vill
Giant Stage Speech, Bloods and Crips, Brosnam Villain James Bond

Had a dream of giving a speech to giant stage 4500. The applause was so loud that I had to wait and start talking and interrupt the sound.

Had dreams about the bloods and crips. First ,we played uno with blue and green cards and c words. There was California, 37, 42, 47, etc. Afterwards, a church was set on fire and people ran.

Had dream that an evil Pierce Brosnam-like villain was being chased by our agent squad. He walked to a courtyard and shot two informants with a silenced pistol. M walked away into a fashion store. Brosnam was there and pretended at first that he didn't recognize M. But then, he took a drill and drilled through cheeks, and the put them on the ground where they flapped around. Reyna watched in terror.

Return home to M, who offered a special treat.
