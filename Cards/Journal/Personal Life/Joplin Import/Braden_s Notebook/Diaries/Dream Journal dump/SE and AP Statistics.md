SE and AP Statistics

Driving with boys when I parked and next to us was a car with Lily, Joceline, Scarlet, Grace, etc.. Strangely, of all the people I was drawn to SE, who I hadn't seen in a while. I played it cool like I didn't notice them, and when we locked eyes she called me out and ran to me. We hugged and I held her hands in front of me, with a great moment having passed.

I woke up and went to a room where I saw her again.

"Did you hug me?"

"No?"

I must have been dreaming â˜º (orange shirt).

What a pleasant dream

AP statistics at school. For some reason, I didn't have my calculator and got stressed but realized I could return home with no repercussions. I return to see Bryce crying with 100 Bill on desk. Mom comes home. He drove home. It turns out he couldn't take the exam because he hadn't brought his calculator. I moved to comfort him.
