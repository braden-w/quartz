# Twin Peaks (Sword Oil) and Valedictorian in the Gy
In a mountain, there was a black oil that was poured from a flask onto someone's hand. As they grabbed a sword, this oil prevented the sword's burning handle from burning their hands and flesh. As the antagonist laughed maniacally, his laughter slowly morphed into dread as he realized his end had come. The person slashes down the bad guy.

After that, I received my valedictorian award in the school gym. I brought my parents down. Afterwards, they arrived and drove a car up my driveway to give my sash. They were gone almost instantly afterwards. Strange experience.
