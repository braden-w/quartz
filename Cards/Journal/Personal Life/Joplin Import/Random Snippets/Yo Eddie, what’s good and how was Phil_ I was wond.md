# Yo Eddie, what’s Good and How Was Phil_ I Was Wond
Yo Eddie, what’s good and how was Phil? I was wondering if I could have some adv

Yo Eddie, what’s good and how was Phil? I was wondering if I could have some advice/general feedback on a project I’m working on. It’s a dashboard/music sharing site specifically for super lazy 2024 Yalies who want to expand the number of Yalies they’re exposed to, while keeping things as low-commitment as possible. You can add someone to your circle if you’ve talked irl for 3 seconds, virtual 30 seconds, or 3 minutes of listening to their Spotify playlists (one of the key features is everyone can express themself through a Spotify playlist that is embedded in the website). Any advice on how to better solve this problem of exposure to other Yalies (and if this is even a real problem) is much appreciated! Need to stress test it (starting to slowly share it with select friends. ); expect huge changes to the website too in the next few days. Some steps to get us started could be:

1. Login with Google->on the home page, add profile info and paste a Spotify playlist url that best describes you
2. Add as many students from the directory that you are vaguely familiar with to your YAM list
3. Explore other parts of the site like the (unfinished) map, etc.
How does that sound? Lemme know if you have any feature requests or other things and I’ll do my best to finish them by this week!
