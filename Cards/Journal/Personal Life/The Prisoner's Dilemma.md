The article opens with the example of car dealers and a peculiar observation: the party who is more unreasonable is apt to get the better end of the deal. Although it is natural to split down the middle, being "unreasonable" can often lead to a party getting a more favorable arrangement. The article gradually branches out to general two-agent games with options to "cooperate" or "cheat", hence making way for the idea of the "Prisoner's Dilemma". After introducing the concept of Nash Equilibrium, the article explores the [[Flood-Dresher Experiment]], which demonstrates that people do not always take the Nash Equilibrium path of "defecting", especially when iteratingâ€”rather, they often choose to cooperate to maximize their earnings, and select to defect to "punish" the other player for defecting.
