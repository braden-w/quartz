Hello this is Jame’s mom, Jane. I would appreciate it if you would stop making fun of my son for saving. He grew up in a poor country and we never had awp. we couldn’t afford awp, just p250 for our children to eat. if you would be so kind and not make fun of my son please, or I will report.

Hi there, this is Jeff, the owner of the Bank on Overpass. I am looking for a man named Jame. I have heard he likes to save. This could be very beneficial for my business so I can feed my family and kids. Thank you for your attention

Hello this is Jame from Mirage Palace, I rented the place last year and I have a non defined rent agreement for when I need to save my awp. I keep finding this guy laying on the couch, his name is Sanji and he always has a awp near him, should I just shoot him?

Hello Jane, I am Queztcalcoatl, the king who owns the temple on Ancient. Your son Jame has been living in my temple because he is "saving" his awp for the past few days. This is unacceptable, it is very disruptive. Please tell Jame to get out of my temple.
