# 2022-03-03 Meeting (User Interview) with Crystal and Megan

## Inventory
- NO Inventory Management and Waste Reduction (Sustainability)
	- GroupMe chat where they list all the things they're missing
	- Make list right before shopping
- 7000 for students, 5000 for food
	- "Don't worry about the budget", just don't break the budget too much

- Davenport works on weekend
	- No swipe for Pierson, but Davenport can go into Pierson
	- Buttery

- Even though inventory issue is big, menu is not complex, pretty simple, and some core items

## Difficulty of Contactless
- We use physical cash to pay dining staff
- Clover is a good center that centralizes everything
- **A lot of people use Cash**
	- About $100 per two weeks
- Every two weeks, cash is emptied

- Going down to the Buttery to order is an experience
- Waiting in line, chatting with managers while they make it is common
- We could be detracting that for contactless

Sustainability

- We have reusable plates

## How Orders Go
- Book with two columns, name and order
- Yell name to announce, we're small enough that we don't need notifications

## Scheduling
- A Mess
- Google form to rank days best for you
	- You work 1 day a week
- There were subs, who also help with payment
- Davenport is even worse (people volunteer so schedule is even more erratic)
- How many times have you needed to close due to staff shortage?
	- Once
- How often do you modify the day's shift?
	- Lots of time, between 12:00-12:30
	- People don't miss closing too often tho

- [[Yale Buttery Book]] made the mango smoothie really popular (since it was on recommended)

## Transaction History
On board, might not be the most helpful
