[[Effective Altruism]]

A natural [[Pandemic Preparedness | pandemic]] is very unlikely to kill everyone, because a virus simultaneously wants to preserve its victim's life to spread which is a conflict of interest.

Imagine there's a virus as deadly as [[Ebola]], but as undetected as [[AIDS]]. There's a 5 year [[incubation period]] and then oh no, you're fucked.

[[Collective imagination]] and the ability to scale from [[0[[000 Personal Life/Sapiens]][[Who else would you recommend me to talk to?]]
