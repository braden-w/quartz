# 2022-02-16 Reflecting on My Feelings About the Website Change in [[Effective Altruism|YEA]]
When the media team meets  (Lakshimi and other parts of organizing team), I would like to ask their preferences from an unbiased side-by-side comparison of our current and old website: which experience they enjoy more and look they prefer

I wish the team consulted me before making the change. To this day I feel hung up about it because I heard the complaints and believe I could have fixed it since I knew how the mobile editor worked, and could have embedded our AirTable gallery. The team's moving on to making a new version without me knowing was really jolting this year. I am in the opinion that we did not give the time the platform deserved nor the input from other members of the team. Having used both, Webflow in my opinion is superior to Weebly, and a quick google search of user reviews seem to agree. I just feel upset because it seems like we wasted a lot time and could have saved a lot of effort had we talked it through; I spent probably at least (conservatively) 20+ hours making the Webflow look polished
