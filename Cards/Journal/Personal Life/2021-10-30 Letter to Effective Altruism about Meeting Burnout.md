# [[2021-10-30]] Letter to Effective Altruism About Meeting Burnout
Written while [[2021-10-30 Studying with Carrie in the Franklin buttery, PGL, and our app works!]]

Hey guys, I’ve felt burnout from the fellowship and was wondering if could get some advice/assistance on how to best proceed; I have so many things I want to do with the fellowship but just have really struggled to find energy to do so in the past wek

I thought I would be ok but spending 3 nights a week, 2 hours at a time (all on days I have classes) with EA has drained me, especially the 6:30pm-7:45PM fellowships, to the point that I have felt anxiety before attending EA events in the past few weeks. Managing the fellowship is great but attending both sessions, emergency facilitating, and seeing some facilitators not even show up has gotten into my head. It’s demoralizing and the worst part is at the end of every week I feel so tired, I don’t have energy left to help manage facilitators or do anything else

I was wondering if I could get some assistance here.

Moving forward, I really would like to see if I can reduce my meeting commitment to two or fewer times a week (ideally we would just reschedule meetings so they don’t happen after dinner but unfortunately that might be infeasible). In my current state, I’m happy to show up to fellowship meetings but it leaves me very little energy to manage the facilitators or think about semester feedback, 1-on-1's, curriculum, etc.. I was wondering if we could do any of the folloing:

1. Have a person take point on managing facilitators and Monday meetings, so that I can focus more on attending Tuesday’s and Thursday’s cohort and being present. This would be best. Eui Young, you’ve done so much but would it be okay if you did this if we chose 1? You have the most experience with this semester’s cohort
2. delegate separate people to run Tuesday’s and Thursday’s fellowships, so that I can spend more time managing
3. Zoom into/be excused from Monday meetings.

Sorry to spring up such an enormous request. It’s not time sensitive. I just wanted to let you all know about this before it gets any worse; I have so many things I want to do with the fellowship but right now just need some extra space/energy to do so
