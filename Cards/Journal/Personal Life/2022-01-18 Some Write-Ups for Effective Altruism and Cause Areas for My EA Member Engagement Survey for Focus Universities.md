# [[2022-01-18]] Some Write-Ups for [[Effective Altruism]] and [[Cause Areas]] for My EA Member Engagement Survey for Focus Universities

## Could You Give Some Details on Anything You Ticked Above? \*
Interned at Rethink Projects during the summer of 2021. Deployed chatbot solution to triage customer inquiries and save operations team 10+ hours on email.

Before EA, I had experience in business during high school and was on the fence of changing my major to Computer Science, Economics, and/or Statistics. EA gave me the push towards effective giving. I am now leaning towards Ethics, Politics, & Economics as a major, and if I pursue Computer Science, to investigate AI safety.

## Why Do You Think This cause(s) is Most Important? [2-4 sentences] \*
I originally came to EA from my interest in AI Risk. Since then, I have expanded my cause area to Global Poverty. One of the biggest ideas I'm interested in pursuing is the "scarcity mindset", or the psychological burden poverty presents to individuals. I am hoping that it is through freeing those of economic burden and the scarcity mindset, that we can free their mental bandwidth to pursue more EA aligned activities.
