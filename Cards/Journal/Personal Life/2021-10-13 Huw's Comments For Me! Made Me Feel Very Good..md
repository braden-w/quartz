# [[2021-10-13]] Huw's Comments For Me! Made Me Feel Very Good.
That's awesome to hear RE the fellowship! Here are some quick reflections, for what they're worth - definitely take with a grain of salt given it was under an hour of facetime )

- Generally you struck me as ambitious and charismatic, which I think are really strong traits to have in team leadership positions
- I liked the nuance in your thinking on comm building strategy; I'm excited for us to investigate easier entry points into EA for folks, and I think you identified the key constraint here which is making sure we don't dilute the message
- I generally thought you were a super strong communicator and expressed your ideas clearly
- I found myself wanting to hear more when we were talking about cruxes for your cause prioritisation. I generally think this is a pretty crucial skill to be demonstrating to folks eg. during fellowships, and so I'd be excited to see you flesh out your key uncertainties in more detail, and figure out what you might learn about the world that could cause you to change your mind
- My impression was that there were still some gaps in your engagement with some core EA ideas, eg. you mentioned having engaged less with [[Longtermism]] so far. Insofar as you're doing fellowship facilitation-type activities, I'd definitely recommend making filling in these gaps a priority - I'm very excited about folks using their grant time to invest in themselves in this way
- Let me know how this lands and if you have any questions or pushback! :)h
