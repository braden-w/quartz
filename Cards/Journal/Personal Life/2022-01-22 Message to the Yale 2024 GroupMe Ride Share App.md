# [[2022-01-22]] Message to the Yale 2024 GroupMe [[Ride Share App]]
Hey everyone!! I've been gathering various ridesharing trips (26 trips in the next few days so far) across sources and made a little concept website to try coordinating ride sharing: [https://yaleshare.netlify.app/](https://yaleshare.netlify.app/)

Ideally, it allows us to

- Add trips from airports to Yale or vice versa
- Groups them by airport
- Sorts them by time

Do y'all have any suggestions on how we could make it better? If so, feel free to DM me. Only been working on it for about a day, so there's lots of room for improvement! Some thoughts were:

- Getting notifications when there is a new signup for your date and airport
- Privacy of information
- Anything else you guys want

@Mahesh Agarwal brought up the ride sharing problem to me a few days ago and how we could go about tackling the transport problem (huge shoutout to him!)
