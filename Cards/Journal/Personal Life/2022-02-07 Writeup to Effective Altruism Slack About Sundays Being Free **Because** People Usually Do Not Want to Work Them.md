# [[2022-02-07]] Writeup to [[Effective Altruism]] Slack About Sundays Being Free **Because** People Usually Do Not Want to Work Them
[[Effective Altruism]]

I wouldn't have as much an issue except that the day is Sundays of all days. Also, since we've lived in the house before, we might be overlooking how much it is to ask them to walk to the house on a Sunday nightI feel like we might be misinterpreting and that this availability is actually the side effect of unwillingness: that Sundays are generally free **_because_** people usually do not want to do work on them. It of all days I feel like is the least convenient for clubs to meetâ€”even I feel like I wouldn't be in the typical "work mood" on a Sunday night before classes beginWhat if we had a vote by the organizing team in [organizing-team-spring-22](https://yaleea.slack.com/archives/C02DEQ0JVBN) to isolate the day of the week on what they feel most willing to attend? Or just simply copy paste a dm to all of them and listen to thoughts (edited)

Ok sounds good; I will compare how many people come to Sunday's compared to availability. I still feel like if anything, we can ask the people who come on Sunday how they feel (and the ones who end up not coming on Sunday are already unwilling or unable togg
