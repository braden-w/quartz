# [[2022-01-16]] Letter to Hopper Commune About COVID Situation and Testing Positive
Yo guys, you all may have gotten a email recently, and I wanted to give a rundown of the situation:

Bad news: I tested positive for COVID 19

Good news:

- I am almost certainly not contagious. Carrie tested negative, which means that I have not been contagious since as early as January 7
- I have had no symptoms for almost two weeks. I had COVID symptoms from January 1-3 (after the booster so it was hard for me to tell if it was that or COVID), and have since fully recovered.
- My brother, who had much worse symptoms before me, took a negative Antigen test for school and was negative since January 5. Since the test I took a week ago was a PCR test, it will continue testing positive after I have covid for up to 90 days. But once I take my antigen test, I anticipate testing negative and returning

Deeply sorry for the covid scare y’all. I just got my test late last night and moved into isolation this morning (which has really nice amenities ngl), and hope to see y’all soon!
