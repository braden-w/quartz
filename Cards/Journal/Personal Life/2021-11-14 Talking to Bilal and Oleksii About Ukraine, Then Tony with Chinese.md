# [[2021-11-14]] Talking to Bilal and Oleksii About Ukraine, Then Tony with Chinese
Had a great moment where we talked about [[Stephan Bandera|Bandera]], who is a celebrated war hero in Ukraine bu also a right leaning antisemitism Nazi sympathizer, according to Wikipedia.

We talked about his antisemitism and support of Nazis but how it was in the interests of just getting Ukraine free. If you are going to pick between Germany who murders millions of innocents, and Russia who murders millions of innocents, you might as well pick whichever helps Ukraine achieve independence more, (consider the counterfactual and nonuniqueness) and so it made sense in this case to support the Nazis.

[[Bilal]] put "[[Stephan Bandera]] is an Effective Altruist" on Overheard at Yale University which was hilarious.
