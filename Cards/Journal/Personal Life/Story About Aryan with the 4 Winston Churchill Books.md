# Story About Aryan with the 4 Winston Churchill Books
Aryan had purchased the Winston Churchill book and offered to sell it to [[Bilal]] for a huge profit, from $1 original to $10. He gloated on how it was superior and [[Economics]]. [[Bilal]] said he had something up his sleeve and Aryan should not do this to their friendship, or else. Aryan did it anyway.

Unbeknownst to him, [[Bilal]] had went to the library the same day having been presented this and bought the books 2-4 (completing the set) for a low price.

When he presented this to Aryan, Aryan immediately realized his mistake.

Aryan was brooding, and said it was worse than when he broke up with his girlfriend 2 years ago

In conclusion, [[Bilal]] fucked with Aryan so bad! It was hilarious
