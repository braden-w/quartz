Braden Wong:

    Yooo Erik congrats on the update! The UI looks super clean and we were super impressed with what you were able to do. I saw your msg in the 2024 groupme about us working together—did we discuss that already? The guys and I don’t remember agreeing to any collaborations between us yet

Hey man, thanks, and congrats on releasing your iOS app as well! When we talked in Commons about sharing calendar updates with each other to keep both apps up to date centrally I took that to constitute that we would "work together" on that element
Do you feel that's a mischaracterization? If so I apologize for describing the relationship as such, I didn't mean any harm I just thought that was an accurate description since you said you'd be comfortable working together to keep the schedules updated

Braden Wong:

    For sure I was down with the idea of collaboration. However, just wanted to clarify that we didn’t commit to anything yet and I wanted to ask the guys first about their opinion. At present, we do think the message is a slight mischaracterization and were wondering if you could delete the collaboration message from the groupme? That said, we would love to work with you in the future and discuss collaboration on butteries and more!

Gotcha. I understand the concern and I'm sorry for not checking in with you to ensure that the rest of the team were ok with it. I promise I didn't mean to overstep any boundary.
I'll definitely unsend the message
So I'm not sure how to say this, but apparently GroupMe doesn't allow unsending messages after 60 minutes pass. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-do-i-delete-or-hide-individual-messages-in-groupme-80558c11-1cb0-4c9d-a8b0-62033d4adcb5

Braden Wong:

    Ayy thanks bro. The guys are all for your launch, just a lil iffy on saying we collaborated on Yale Menus yet since we haven't made it official. I know the message came from a good place and rlly appreciate the shoutout; they haven't met you in person so I understand it might be harder for them to see that. If you can't remove the message that's chill—just wanted to get that part clarified as I balance the two parties. I personally am receptive to working together—just give us a bit more time to iron out a few kinks and talk it out
