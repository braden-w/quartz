# [[2021-11-18]] Dinner with William Bench
[[Even if theyâ€™re sentient , Oysters are having a blast]]

Number of land vs. sea animals killed per year

Lobbying fish certifiers

Good cop and bad cop working together

Farmed fish actually still eat wild fish

Does a caged chicken actually have a worse than free chicken?

Fish prefer color of tank, usually dark green, and a sweet spot density
