# [[2021-12-17]] Q4 Launch Party with Emerge
Napped and woke up literally right before our arrival!

Delicious tacos. I ate 6, but Bryce ate a whopping 12! It was a great time.

Had a great talk with Evelyn about [[We Are the Next Boomer Generation]], [[Factory Farming]], [[What's stopping us to be despised for not being vegan|The evolution of our ethical language]], [[Expanding Our Moral Circle]], etc.

Finally, said goodbye to Sly and Isaac and played some ping pong.

On the way back, I ordered tickets for Spider-Man: No Way Home and cleared a bunch of messages (wrote some Obsidian too).
