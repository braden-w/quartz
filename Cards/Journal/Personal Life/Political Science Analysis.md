# Political Science Analysis
The article begins with the evolution of what "analysis" is. It describes early Political Science after World War II was primarily descriptive and judgmental, much less oriented toward explanation and analysis. It then discusses the growing focus on questions of "why." It is this pursuit of "why" that leads to political analysis: to engage material, understand concepts, and observe how they may be applied to real world situations.

The article introduces the [[Course Notes/Rational Choice Approach]], also known as Formal Political Theory, Positive Political Theory, or Political Economy. The idea is that individuals act rationally in according to their preferencesâ€”that they are self-interested. We dissected two properties of preference relations, that they are 1. Comparable and 2. Transitive in comparison. From these two properties, the article discusses various examples with analysis.
