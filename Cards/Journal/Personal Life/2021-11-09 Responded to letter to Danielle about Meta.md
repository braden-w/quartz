# [[2021-11-09]] Responded to Letter to Danielle About Meta
Dear Danielle,

Thank you so much! I just completed the forms in my Facebook Recruiting profile.

Is there anything else on my end that I can do to help you out? I’m excited to see what’s next and will be sure to let you know if I have any more questions!

Best,
Braden

Hi Danielle, this is Braden! We've been corresponding through email about [[Meta]] recruiting. I thought of two quick questions: is there any one thing that you are looking for that goes beyond what's immediately obvious on the Facebook careers page, and also, how did you find me? I'm curious to know! Thank you so much

Hi Danielle,
Thank you so much! I’ll sign up and input my availability right away. I also had two quick questions if that’s cool!

1. Is there any one thing that you are looking for that candidates often miss, or is not immediately obvious from the careers page and interview materials?
2. How did you find me? I'm curious to know!

Thank you so much once again!

Best,
Braden
