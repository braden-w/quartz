# [[2021-11-22]] Wonderful Lunch in Franklin with Bienn, Maggie, Kai, Path, and Matt Burtell
Talked about

- [[Space Elevator]]s (or rather, a giant rope hanging from space)
- [[Battery Revolution]]
- Careers and CS. Path wanted to switch to ECON because he doesn't like being told what to do, but I think he should really try to do CS because ECON is even more like that.
