# [[2022-01-04]] Letter to Carrie About Family Getting COVID
Carrie, I have quite possibly the worst newsâ€”I have reason to suspect my brother and dad have COVID. The original source is unclear, but my brother woke up and lost his sense of taste and my dad feels quite unwell. Bryce actually didn't go to school yesterday since he was feeling unwell, (honestly duh, that makes sense how I was able to use the car to go get my booster shot). I haven't been with anyone outside of your family, my family, Yvonne, and Kaitlyn in the past weeksâ€”but it's likely Bryce got it from a tennis partner? That's what we believe is most likely, since Bryce felt unwell first. I feel great and have no symptoms other than minor soreness from the shot on my arm. I was already masking up with Bryce since I suspected Bryce has the cold, and was masked with my dad yesterday. But to make this actionable, I can't risk getting you or your family sickâ€”let's put a pause on activities for the week? My family is boosted and hopefully can make a speedy recovery.  I am so sorry for putting you and your family in unnecessary harm. I should have seen the writing on the wall and been more suspicious. I accept full responsibility if you or anyone in your family gets sickâ€”I'll get chicken noodle soup and anything else you want(and more because both of your parents are working and high risk like mine)ðŸ¤§. I hope they fully recover and I can be with you soon, but if you want to distance yourself from me for the rest of break or longer I completely understand :â€™/
