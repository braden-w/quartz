# [[2021-11-27]] YDN Yeji Kim Interview
Just two quick follow up questions:

1. Just to confirm since I am mentioning it in the article, are you guys all suitemates?

Yep: 4 suitemates out of a suite of 9!

2. What is DCommune?

I guess we're a collective of programmers and problem-solvers. We like to call ourselves “the commune” because we live together, and share responsibilities and possessions (mostly a ton of spicy snacks). Plus, we live in entryway D, so we combined these two identities into “DCommune”.

-“It was Halloween night.” Braden Wong wrote to the News. “We had just conceived the idea at 12:53 am. I told the lads I could probably get a prototype done by the end of the night—but I had left my computer in a friend’s suite. Without second thought, [[Bilal]] raced in the pouring rain on his bike to get my computer. Together, we pulled a near all-nighter until we had a working user interface.”

- “We want to promote experimentation and exploration on campus, especially for first-years and sophomores this year, who didn’t get the same opportunity to fully explore the campus. We hope it helps create some memories,” the creators wrote to the News.

-The creators also noted how students tend to remain in their own residential colleges to get a nighttime snack or study. They hope that this app will motivate students to explore other college butteries.

-“We’re really grateful for the turnout, it’s beyond anything we could’ve hoped for,” the creators wrote to the News.

-Peng mentions that one of the coolest parts of making and releasing the YBB app has been hearing people around them casually use or mention it. “There’s been instances where we’ve been with friends at night, the topic of butteries comes up, and someone nonchalantly pulls up the site to check what’s open. It’s very awesome to see people using the program we made.”

-Concerning any future projects, Moin said that they have a wall of ideas and problems on the common room wall, and a new project currently in the works.

Feel free to take on any questions and/or add on to responses someone already answered!

1. What are your grade levels and what are your pronouns?

Braden Wong, sophomore, he/him/his

David Peng, sophomore, he/him/his

[[Bilal]], sophomore, he/him/his

Sonny Nguyen, sophomore, he/him/his

2. Could you give some background as to what exactly the [[Yale Buttery Book]] app is?

Could someone Insert our goal from the website here

Quite simply, if someone’s hungry at midnight, the problem was that

Our app compiles buttery times, menus, and recommendations for tasty items on a convenient platform. On one side, we hope students who want to use the buttery more have places to eat or study more, be more aware. We also hope it promotes experimentation and exploration on campus, especially for first-years and sophomore this year, who didn’t get the same opportunity to fully explore the campus. We want to promote creating memories.

A lot of Yale experience centers on

It’s a diverse students body. Increasing the opportunities students get to learn from each other, increasing the diversity of experience and backgrounds. By increasing the footfall of all butteries,

Try new foods, meet new people

On other hand, allow kids to interact with each other.

We notice that students tend to remain in the batteries of their own colleges. By providing a platform to allow them to be more easily aware of other buterries around them, we hope to motivate them to explore the nice basement cafes elsewhere on Yale’s campus.

The butteries are a concept unique to Yale. It’s also a more casual environment for students to interact with each other, get some work done, and also get a meal at an odd hour. By increasing the footfall of butteries,

….. Diversity of students, cross-interaction of students of different colleges, backgrounds,

3. Why did you decide to develop this app/how did this project start?

Blurb from website:

At 12:53 AM, four famished friends wondered, “What buttery is open right now?”

Finding no answers, we set out to resolve this perennial question ourselves. In search of the sacred texts—the menu and hours of operation—we voyaged to the edges of Yale’s campus, from the extremities of Murray/Franklin to the backwaters of TD. Like good tourists, we left only footsteps and took only photographs. Like good gastronomers, we left (almost) no items unordered and sampled every regional speciality. And like good coders, we left no documentation unread and made only atomic commits.

Powered by Hopper’s Mozz Sticks, in protest of Gheav’s sandwich monopolism and eager to fill our empty git-contribution graphs, we compiled this compendium.

DCommune is proud to present: The Yale Buttery Book

Dedicated to all Yalies hungry at twilight.

4. How long did it take to develop the app?

8 days, including coding, testing and compiling information - involved visiting all the butteries

5. Could you speak a bit about how the development process went?

Braden: It was Halloween night. We had just conceived the idea at 12:53 am. I told the lads I could probably get a prototype done by the end of the night—but I had left my computer in a friend’s suite. Without second thought, [[Bilal]] raced in the pouring rain on his bike to get my computer. Together, we pulled a near all-nighter until we had a working user interface. It was so much fun.

Sonny: Coding didn’t take that long compared to the time it took to collect all the information and sample all the butteries ourselves to create food recommendations. We used all the resources and connections we could find to double check the hours—archived residential college websites, classmates in other colleges, Tinder matches.

6. Have you guys always had an interest in app development, or is this more of a recent interest?

David: In the past, I’ve only worked on programming projects in an academic or research context, so Yale Buttery Book was the first app I’ve been a part of and it’s pretty new and exciting for me! Braden is a frontend god, I’ve learned a lot from working with him about app and web development frameworks and programs to continue toying with in the future.

7. How have you been advertising this app?

David: We had been showing the work-in-progress to our friends at dinner, getting some feedback and initial reactions. When we felt we were really ready, we cleared our schedules one Thursday night to make final touches and send the official launch email—Thursday night because every buttery is open on Thursday! To get past the email limit set by gmail, each of us emailed a fourth of the undergrad student body. For future updates, we set up a DCommune email list and an Instagram page at @yalebutterybook!

[support@yalebutterybook.com](mailto:support@yalebutterybook.com)

8. How many downloads do you have to date?

Braden + David: So far, 6.6k people have visited the site and 401 have downloaded the app. We’re really grateful for the turnout, it’s beyond anything we could’ve hoped for.

9. How do you think the app has been functioning so far?

David: One of the coolest experiences from making and releasing YBB has been hearing people around us casually use or mention it. There’s been instances where we’ve been with friends at night, the topic of butteries comes up, and someone nonchalantly just pulls up the site to check what’s open. It’s very awesome to see people using the program we made.

[[Bilal]]: A testament to the success from the app is the feedback we’ve gotten from people through the app itself. We’ve got interested students and even buttery managers who suggested improvements and emailed newly-made digital versions of menus.

10. What are your goals for this app/any further plans for the future?

[[Bilal]]: We’re excited about the feedback for YBB. We believe there are a few interesting problems in Yale students’ life that could be improved with a cool app—we’ve literally got a wall of ideas on one side of our common room—and we have an exciting new project in the works.

David

11. What impact do you hope this app will have on the Yale community?

12. Anything else you would like to add?
