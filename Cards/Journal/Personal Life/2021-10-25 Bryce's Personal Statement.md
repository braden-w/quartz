# [[2021-10-25]] Bryce's Personal Statement
Match point. I’m standing at the base line ready to serve at my opponent. I slam a powerful lefty serve, forcing him off the court. I attack the next ball with a forehand and come up to the net. My opponent, desperate to save the point, lobs the ball up to my backhand—my right side—hoping for a weaker shot. Without thinking twice, I pass the racket to my other hand. I leap up and smash the ball in the corner to win the match. As we walk up to the net for a righty handshake, my opponent’s face is astonished.

“Good game.”

Every day, I interact with the world with both hands, and these two lenses have become a symbol of who I am.

I am a melting pot of two different cultures. A convergence of two stories. A collision of two worlds. My right-handed Sichuanese mom comes from mainland China, and along with her stoic personality she carries an immigrant “work hard, play later” mentality. My dad is a left-handed third generation American-born Cantonese, and his outlook on parenthood is far different—that a child should enjoy their youth to the fullest. Yet somehow, their two contrasting mindsets found a way to coincide and give birth to me. I am a combination of perspectives that run so deep, they are physical. I am ambidextrous, and my two hands represent the two sides of my life.

My right hand is for the pencil and represents my academic pursuits. I started learning math with my mom in first grade, sitting at the kitchen counter while she made lunch. Over egg-fried rice, we would tackle workbook problems together until factorization became second nature and

On the other hand, my left hand is for the racket and represents my grit and physicality. It is how I learned tennis: a right-handed person playing lefty. My dad’s American “follow your dreams” mindset inspired me to be different. Over long car rides, we would . As a young boy, I struggled to swing the racket and return the ball. When my feet hurt and my legs cramped, and I was going to continue practicing until I was able to play.

After a year of dedication and grit, I was proud of achieving this goal. Learning to play left-handed was not only an achievement, but a valuable asset since few people are used to playing left-handed players. Thanks to my dad, I learned to pursue my passions even when I had to balance them with homework and academic teams. This was the embodiment of the American spirit—the story of finding yourself.

My mom’s Chinese “work hard” orientation found my desire to tackle problems. My dad’s American dream mindset enabled me to pursue tennis. The culmination of their cultures gave me the best life I could ask for. I devour hot dogs and hamburgers under the humid nights of the Fourth of July. I still enjoy fried rice and dumplings.

My right hand is for the pencil. My left hand is for the pencil.

My mother taught me self-motivation. My father taught me self-determination.

I am the ideal confluence of two different lives.

she taught me “work hard now” ethic and where I furthered my pursuit by becoming a member of math team and science olympiad. These two teams require studying and collaboration. The challenge of outperforming other schools is daunting, but we do not let our nerves impede our performance. On competition days, tension fills the air, everyone hoping that the past weeks spent studying will produce results to their expectations. As a more experienced member on these teams, I teach newer members tricks to the tests and make sure everyone has an enjoyable time. I feel at home among others who share interests with me. I would have never found such beautiful communities or experienced such robust feelings without my mom teaching me the importance of hard work. She is the story of a Chinese immigrant, the “work now play later” idea.

“Good game.”

Every day, I interact with the world with both hands, and these two lenses have become a symbol of who I am. I am a melting pot of two different cultures. The convergence of two different stories. A collision of two different worlds. My right-handed Sichuanese mom comes from mainland China, and along with her stoic personality she carries an immigrant “work hard, play later” mentality. My dad is a left-handed third generation American-born Cantonese, and his outlook on parenthood is far different—that a child should enjoy their youth to the fullest. Yet somehow, their two contrasting mindsets found a way to coincide and give birth to me. I am a combination of perspectives that run so deep, they are physical. I am ambidextrous, and my two hands represent the two sides of my life.

My right hand is for the pencil. I started learning math with my mom in first grade, sitting at the kitchen counter while she made lunch. Over egg-fried rice, we would tackle workbook problems together until factorization became second nature and I could sing the quadratic formula.

My left hand is for the racket. It is a reminder of my commitment to grit: when I first started playing tennis, my dad’s American mindset inspired me to follow my own path. I chose to play tennis left-handed as a right-handed person. It would be a tactical advantage since fewer people are used to playing left-handed players. Although it felt more like a burden at first, I continued practicing even when my patience was tested, determined to forge my own path. I will never forget the feeling of winning my first match.

As a person who carried both lenses, it did not mean I clearly saw who I was. As a child, I dreaded the question, “Do you speak Chinese?” Not being able to say yes felt sacrilegious to my culture. How could I connect with my roots if I could not speak Chinese?

During my first Chinese New Year with my extended family, I sat with relatives I did not know. Although we were not familiar with one another, we had a great time. As we sang old Chinese folk songs on the karaoke and enjoyed crispy Peking duck and egg fried rice, my relatives taught me that culture is more than just understanding a language.

I may not be able to speak a word of Chinese, but I do not let it prevent me from appreciating my heritage. My mother brought me tradition. I drink boba like water. I rejoice at the sight of red envelopes. I have a high spice tolerance and love traditional Chinese dishes. I chat with my mom’s family using a special recipe: a pinch of broken English, a dash of Chinese, and a handful of gestures.

On the other hand, my father is the conduit for a different culture. We barbecue wings on the Fourth of July, cheer for our favorite football teams on Superbowl Sunday, and eat turkey and pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving. American culture means being different and accepting who you are as part of a greater family.

Like I have two sides, I have two cultures that define who I am. I am a multitude of lenses converging into one point, experiencing the best of two worlds.
