# [[2021-10-25]] Email About Fall Fest
Dear Anna, Gina, and Angela,

Thank you all for taking an hour from your busy schedules to meet today during lunch!

To recap, I just wanted to check in and make sure I have all plans written down correctly so we’re on the same page for Fall Fest. Also CC’ing this to HCC so that they are in on what’s going on.

## On the Day Of, HCC Will Meet at 12PM to Help Assist with Setup. Event is 1-4 PM.

## If Weather Permits, We Will Also Set up Cornhole and Spikeball. If it Rains, We Will Set up Inside the Dining Hall Instead.

## Gina Will Provide:
1. Professional photographer with massive decorations and backdrops (her fiancee)
2. 2 Palletes of Pumpkins

3. 12 Dozen Cider Donuts (from J&A), bagged up
4. Hot Apple Cider

5. Basket of Apples
6. Popcorn machine

## Anna Will Provide:
1. Pumpkin Paint

2. Folding Table

3. Tablecloths

4. Halloween Napkins

5. Decorations for Tables

6. Sanitizer wipes
7. Carving kits

## Gina, Had a Few Quick Questions Following up From Our Discussion:
1. Could we have some sample pictures of decorations from our photographer?

2. Will photographer be taking care of layout of decorations, or should we also have a general floor layout ready as well?
3. Could we confirm what skeleton decorations our photographer has, since a lot of Hopper kids have been requesting skeleton decorations.

Anything else that I’m missing? Thank you so very much and look forward to working with you this Friday!!

Best,
Braden
