The article explores the concept of a "stag hunt" and how cooperation arises. If hunters are to cooperatively pursue a stag, what are each of them entitled to given a successful hunt, and what stops them from chasing an easier hare? In the stag hunt, what is rational for one player to choose depends on his beliefs about what the other will choose. The stag hunt is present in many other examples, such as two men pilling at the oars of a boat—"by an agreement or convention, tho' they have never given promises to each other… if both row, they bet the outcome that is best for each". This conflict, between individual rationality and mutual benefit, is also present in the "prisoner's dilemma". The article explores this theme in greater detail, cooperation as a problem for evolutionary theory, and the formation and dissolution of social contracts.

"By an agreement or convention, tho' they have never given promises to each other… if both row, they bet the outcome that is best for each" is like a [[Stag Hunt]] because the payoff matrix resembles

|           | Row | Don't Row |
| --------- | --- | --------- |
| Row       | 4,4 | 2,0       |
| Don't Row | 0,2 | 2,2       |
