# [[2021-11-20]] Franklin Mood Lighting, Eating with [[Alex Chun]], Vanessa Li, [[David Peng]], [[Lisa Dong]], and [[Elaine Liu]]. Sharing the Vanessa Story with David
Reminds me of [[2021-11-16 Eating Cod in Schwarzman, Helping Carrie with CS50, Vanessa Strange Encounter]], which we shared with David. He was laughing, and Carrie and I loved his reaction.

When I asked David if he knew about my history with Vanessa, he joked of course, he was here last year.

Carrie joked that it was especially funny because it must have been inconceivable to David to have ever done such a thing.
