# Nash Equilibrium
The article explores the topic of [[Nash Equilibrium]] and its applications in various types of games. Beyond the Prisoner's dilemma, it explores other examples such as the duopoly and arms race, and the common property problem (which is a prisoner's dilemma in disguise), Bach or Stravinsky, etc..

One thing I found interesting was that it labeled [[Nash Equilibrium]] as a stable "social norm", such that if everyone adheres to this norm, nobody wishes to deviate. There were two components of [[Nash Equilibrium]]:

1. Players act in accordance with the theory of rational choice, given their beliefs about other players' actions
2. These beliefs are correct

The article continues to explore various games as examples.
