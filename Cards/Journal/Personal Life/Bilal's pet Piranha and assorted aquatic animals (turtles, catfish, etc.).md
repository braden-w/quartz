# Bilal's Pet Piranha and Assorted Aquatic Animals (turtles, Catfish, etc.)
[[Bilal]] bought a Piranha for about $30 USD equivalent. It was great except that it always tried to bite you (hence you need gloves) and ate meat, filling the aquarium with red blood, so they quickly returned it the same day.
