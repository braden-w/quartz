# [[2021-12-19]] Messages to the [[Buttery Book Boys]] About Flutter

## Tutorials
The best Flutter Tutorials I've seen so far:

1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ukSR1GRtMU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ&index=1
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAT4PNWA5Wg&list=PLfNDfEpg5eOOxE6arbfrloHtieJ4aSY9v&index=7

Should take about a week to pick up and be competent, maybe less, as we complete the playlists

## Agenda
During the call, how does it sound if we do the following?

1. Set goals for what to do during break—what to learn, test apps to build and demonstrate our knowledge, etc.
2. Assign each of us a different domain to manage/be experts in—outreach, development, buttery manager correspondance, Elo Yale, etc. So for example, one person would be ultimately responsible for making sure outreach gets done (doesn't do outreach by themselves, more like manages the team to make sure they are always on top of it)
3. Vibe
