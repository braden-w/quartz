# [[2021-11-02]] Messages to Facilitators Who Had Missed Meetings
Hey **\_\_**, how are you doing? I just wanted to check in if you saw my message in # fellowship-fall-21 and you can make our fellowship session Thursday. You have been an awesome facilitator and we missed you last week. I’m sending this on the principle of fairness and to make sure we’re on the same page—the other facilitators who attended worked extra hard to fill your spot on short notice, and I wanted to be proactive and make sure that we can prevent that from happening again. Thank you so much!
