# Lefties in Baseball

## The Platoon Advantage
> If you "split" a hitter's stats into how he does against righties vs. lefties, chances are, he'll have better numbers against pitchers who throw from the opposite side as he bats. Some teams will "platoon" two players at one position -- one right-handed hitter, the other a lefty -- to deploy depending on which kind of pitcher they're facing.
>
> Now here's the thing that really makes lefty pitchers so valuable: The lefty platoon advantage is bigger than the righty platoon advantage. Lefty hitters do worse against lefty pitchers than righty hitters do against righty pitchers.
>
> It makes sense. Over the course of a lefty hitter's baseball life -- from Little League to high school to college to the Minor Leagues to MLB -- he'll face many more righty pitchers than he will lefties. Less experience seeing lefty pitching likely makes it more difficult to hit when he does face it. Meanwhile, a righty hitter will see tons of righty pitching. He has the advantage of familiarity that comes from all those repetitions.

## Batting Oppostive of a Pitcher
> Conventional wisdom in baseball is that yes, a left-handed batter does better against a right-handed pitcher.
>
> The same can be said for a right-handed batter against a left-handed pitcher. But what exactly about the opposite-handed matchup makes it relevant in baseball?
>
> Most of a right-handed pitcherâ€™s breaking pitches will move away from a right-handed batter, making them harder to hit.
>
> A right-handed batter has to lunge after an outside pitch and has a weaker swing as a result. But those same breaking pitches will curve toward a lefty, thus making them easier to hit. The same principle applies to left-handed pitchers against right-handed batters.
>
> To make the most of the lefty-righty battle coaches will strategically place left-handed batters in the lineup and left-handed pitchers in the pitching rotation.
>
> If a manager knows that a lefty is coming up to bat, he might swap out his pitcher for a left-hander, to have a more competitive matchup.
