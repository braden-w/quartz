# Funniest Pilot Callsigns
Some of the best callsigns I've heard of:
- "Blaze" – Caught on fire in the base kitchen
- "Headless" – Pilot's last name was Horseman
- "Hurricane" – Female pilot named Katrina
- "Legend" – Failed an exam that no one had ever failed in history
- "Vodka" – Pilot’s name was Smirnoff
