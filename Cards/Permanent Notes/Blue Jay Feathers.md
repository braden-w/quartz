[[Blue Jay]] Feathers Scatter Light and Appear Blue

The blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata) produces melanin, a black pigment, meaning that its feathers should appear black. However, tiny air sacs in the bird's feathers scatter light, making them appear blue to our eyes. This scattering of light within the blue jay's feathers is very similar to Rayleigh scattering, the phenomenon responsible for the answer to the age-old "why is the sky blue?" question. Thus, since the distinctive blue color of the blue jay's feathers is not caused by pigments, it is possible to change the color of the bird's feathers back to black by altering their structure. In fact, damaged blue jay feathers do appear black as all traces of blue disappear when the light scattering is disrupted.
