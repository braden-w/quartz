title: Dumb Kid in a Hotel
---

# Dumb Kid in a Hotel
> A man sitting in the hotel said to his friend "Look at that kid waiting tables, he’s so dumb that if I put 500 and 50 notes in front of him, he will pick up the fifty note…. let me show you.
>
> He hollered at the kid, put both 500 and 50 bills at the table and said "Take a note of greater value out of these two". When the child picked up the fifty note, they both laughed out loud and left, the child went back to his work.
>
> Another person who sat besides and witnessed this called the child afterwards and asked "You're a grown kid who still doesn't know the difference between fifty and five hundred notes. How come? That's a loss".
>
> The child smiled and said "This man often comes here and demonstrates the same thing to his buddies for kicks and giggles, to amuse over my stupidity as I pick up the note of fifty each time, they have a momentary laugh over this, and I get fifty rupees. The day I picked 500 would be the day this game will be over and… my income too”.

There is no need to be wise everywhere… especially when being wise affects one's own peace, interests and happiness, then it is wise to become a fool.
