# [[2022-05-30]] Invite Friends to the Summer Virtual Fellowship
Hey Kai! I remembered we talked about Effective Altruism and was thinking of you as a potential good fit for our summer virtual fellowship! The fellowship is designed to prepare students to maximize their positive impact in the future, and fellows have a weekly 90-minute discussion where they discuss ideas and strategies for improving the world through evidence and reason. If you’re interested, the application is here and should be super short—it’s 3 100-word short responses, and a longer 200-word response due Wednesday!
