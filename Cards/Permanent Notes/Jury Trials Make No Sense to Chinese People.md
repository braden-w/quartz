# Jury Trials Make No Sense to Chinese People
> What US Laws Make no sense to the Chinese?
>
> The big one I can think off hand is jury trials.
>
> There have been a number of times in which I tried to explain trial by jury to someone from China, and they thought I was making things up and pulling a prank on them.

See [[Social Hierarchy|Class]]

> The thing about jury trials in China is that people expect that the members of the jury will vote for the people that they have the most personal connections to (and everyone is connected to someone else), and that both sides will try to bribe/coerce the jury into make a decision that is favorable for them. Also if you put 12 random Chinese people in a room, they will set up a hierarchical and the decision will be made by the one or two people with the highest social status/strongest personalities.

> The idea that you would trust your fate to 12 random strangers rather than a professional judge is crazy to most Chinese. Also the idea that a jury prevents state oppression seems silly. If you pick 12 random strangers, the odds are that you will get someone that is a state employee or works for a state-owned enterprise that can be pressured. Better take your changes with a judge.

> Also this is not uniquely Chinese, most everyone I know from East Asia has this reactionâ€¦.
