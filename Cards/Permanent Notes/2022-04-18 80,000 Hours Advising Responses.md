# 2022-04-18 [[80,000 Hours]] Advising Responses

# What Do You Think Are the Most Pressing Problems in the World?

## What is Your Definition of Positive Impact?
I really value a life that is storylike and/or one in which suffering is justified (the two are not interchangeable although similar in my mind)—and would like to craft a life or narrative that ideally fulfills these criteria. I believe that this is an underlying motivation that pushes me to maximize my positive impact—I would like my life to have meaning, and subscribe to the idea that “we can’t control our suffering, but we can control what we suffer for”.

Less philosophically, I think positive impact is maximizing expected well-being, through a combination of making the world better, being virtuous, and acting rightly (with a particular emphasis on the first one).

## What Global Problems Do You Think Are Most Pressing? Try to Rank Them as Best You Can. We’ve Listed Below the Ones You Ticked on the Application Form to Provide Inspiration but Feel Free to Change Your Answers or Write More.
1. Artificial Intelligence Alignment
2. Technological/economic growth
3. Science
4. Global poverty and health
5. Promoting effective altruism
6. Peace and political stability
7. Education and employment
8. Peace and political stability
9. Global priorities research
10. Climate change

## What Do You Most Enjoy? What Jobs Do You Think You Could Become Good At?
I absolutely love building things. Particularly, finding a problem, learning about it, and implementing a solution start to finish. When I was younger, I really enjoyed playing with Legos, and currently it manifests itself as coding applications.

I’m quite tech savvy, but academically am equally STEM and humanities oriented. On top of this, I’ve spend a large portion of my high school and college career in leadership positions in student government—particularly, in high school, I was class and executive president of a constituency of 3500 students.

Based off my experience, I think jobs where there is a high degree of interpersonal leadership, inspiring teams through changing team culture, with some technical dimension, are a good fit for me. As of now, given my current status as a student and career capital, I’ve tended towards software engineering since it is fairly open to students regardless of age or pedigree, so long as they are competent.

# [[What Do I Want to Do?|What Are Your Options?]]
Below are your plans as you described them on the application form. It’s useful for us to have a bit more detail on them for our call.

## Artificial Intelligence Safety Research or Governance
I am relatively tech savvy and am interested in software engineering, but I do not go to a technical school or deeply spec into AI courses. Grad school may be difficult for me.

## Software Engineering
I have experience in this, although it is a relatively common career path and other people could do it. Also am not sure if it will allow me to leverage softer skills

## Entrepreneurship
I enjoy entrepreneurship and it seems like a good place to leverage both technical and soft skills. But it is very risky

## Politics / Applied Policy
I’ve done leadership in high school student council, which was incredibly bureaucratic, but I haven’t had much experience in direct policy work during college

## Community Building
A good place to leverage my leadership abilities, but I am concerned that I may not have the opportunity of using my experience with building

Choosing whether or not to consider graduate school to study Artificial Intelligence, deciding on majors (currently intending on double majoring in "Ethics, Politics, & Economics" and "Computer Science and Psychology").

 What Are Your [key uncertainties](https://80000hours.org/career-decision/article/)?

1. Should I actually go for AI Safety if I am not as technical or come from a technical school?
2. I am relatively tech savvy and am interested in software engineering, but am not sure if I am capable of grad school
3. What careers best utilize a mix of some tech savviness with humanities and/or academic balance?
4. How feasible is it to do two activities in my career at once? This could balance out my fear that some careers allow me to leverage some skills but not others, etc.
