[[Interpolation|Our Brains Fills in the Gaps]]

After a long day marching in the sun and ordered to do exercises right next to the sun as the commander taunts you that you want to hop in the pull, the commander yells, "Jump!"" Not into the pool, but you are conditioned to think that the command means into the pool.
