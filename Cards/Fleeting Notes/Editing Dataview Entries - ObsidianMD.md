# Editing Dataview Entries - ObsidianMD
There is one solution out there that uses Dataview.js (the JavaScript version of Dataview) with Obsidian Buttons to mimic this behavior: [Using metaedit, buttons, templater, nldtase and dataview together - Share & showcase - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/using-metaedit-buttons-templater-nldtase-and-dataview-together/35911). You could try reverse engineering this

Another project out there is [Obsidian DB Folder](https://github.com/RafaelGB/obsidian-db-folder), which gives a Notion-database view of markdown files complete with editing. This can be created for all files that are in a folder, match a tag, incoming/outing link, or query (to be released soon).
