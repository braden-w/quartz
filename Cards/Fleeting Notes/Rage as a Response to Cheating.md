# Rage as a Response to Cheating
If you responded with [[Rage]] because someone was [[Cheating]] and they replied, "being [[Angry]] only makes me more likely to cheat so why are you doing it," you would be further enraged.

This is because it's not just a means to change behavior (see [[Rage as a Tool to Manipulate Behavior]]).

Instead, it is an outlet through which we express that we believe something is [[Socially Unacceptable]]. See [[Rage as a Signaling Device to Express Emotion]].
