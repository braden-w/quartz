# MIT Orientation Story (You Belong Here)
> In the freshman orientation at MIT, the presenter asked the incoming class to raise their hands if they were sure they belonged there, that MIT had done the right thing to accept them into this impressive university.
>
> Very few hands went up. Most of the students kept their hands down, including my friend.
>
> The presenter went on. They asked the students to raise their hands if they thought MIT was a great university.
>
> All of the students raised their hands.
>
> The presenter then explained the logical fallacy of imagining that MIT is a great school, but thinking it could be so utterly abysmal at properly admitting its students.
>
> My friend did, of course, graduate from MIT.
