# How Carrie and I Met
Homecoming + Date at [[BBQ Chicken]] and you were with your family + Quassy + Hopper Dinner + Playing Piano + Bumping Into Each Other + CS50 + Shang Chi

- Forgot Carrie's name at Quassy (the same day asking for dinner)
- Had breakfast for dinner at Hopper Dining (bad food)
- While Carrie was touring the buttery, we kept bumping into each other I played piano since it was the first time I could play in a month

- A recurring theme—we each try to throw each other off, but instead end up making things weirder
- You thought I liked you, and did all these things to throw me off, but I didn’t like you that way but the things you did actually made me think you liked me and led to it actually happening

I was also just terrible at thinking how things would be interpreted

like when you said TROPHY WIFE and the NO SEX ROOM

Or you declined Shang Chi and I was bummed but like aight but then was like wait my suitemates!  but then showed up ALONE, so we had to walk together. The optics of that.
