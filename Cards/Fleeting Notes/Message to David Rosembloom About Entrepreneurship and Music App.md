# Message to David Rosembloom About Entrepreneurship and Music App
I want to see this app succeed! Because of that, I will be up front about some of my concerns and experiences, should they be helpful, along the way. Something I've internalized as Iâ€™ve built stuff the past year is that above all, we should get something delivered and see how people like ourselves use to it. No matter how pretty something is, what really matters is how often we end up pulling our our phone and using it. In fact, an ugly product might be even better because if people *still* use it, it means that itâ€™s really good and solves a problem that is actually worth building.

I remember reading a bunch of Y Combinator advice about MVPs, but it takes a long time to internalize what they actually mean. Itâ€™s a really different experience for how something looks on paper versus once it actually exists. Some things look stupid on paper, but we use them all the time (hopping in a stranger's car sounds stupid, but that's Uber). Some things look awesome on paper, but we never end up using them (this is a sad reality for most ideas). If something is the latter and the idea actually is not good in reality, it's best to have something minimal built as quickly as possible, so that we minimize the time spent finding out that it doesn't work. We want to get something delivered asap.

You might be thinking I'm like shooting down the app idea or that I'm hesitant to work on it haha, it's more like I'm approaching this with a focus on the process. So many ideas can be really good or bad, it just is a matter of seeing them in action. I would just like to be epistemically modest on how I understand the world works. Tl;dr, the first draft might be shitty but that is okay ðŸ˜† we'll work from there

Also thank you for bearing with my delayed texting. The final projects for both British classes and my Machine Learning Course is this week, so I have 25 pages of writing and three machine learning assignments to complete haha
