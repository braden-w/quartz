# 333 - Excuses and Rationalizations Are Not Valid… And We Know That (Dan Cnossen)

## Excuses and Rationalizations
[[The Log]]

Breaking down long term goals into short term procedures
The next ball, the next step
[[Focus on the Next Step]]
Think about this when playing tennis

Countless surgeries and almost killed by Potassium
Nightmares, dried throat and no water
Being in the ICU right after deployment

Just the beginning

Recruiting from Paralympics
Thought biathalon was running and swimming

Live high train low

Meditation
When you open up your point of view, you relax
Related to need to spot animals in peripheral vision

Nobody knows where you're from. Just what you can do here and now
Always be grateful for what you have
You haven’t had to endure nearly the same amount of pain
