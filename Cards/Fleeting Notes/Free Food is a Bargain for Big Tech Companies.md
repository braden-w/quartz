# Free Food is a Bargain for [[Big Tech Companies]]
> Many software/tech companies offer free food and soda/coffee/etc. Quite a few even offer free beer.
>
> While this seems very generous - it’s really not. When you have employees that you pay $100 to $200 an hour, giving away $10 for a free lunch can stop them heading out to nearby restaurants and spending a long lunch there. If the free food is convenient enough, they’ll even work at their desks while they eat.
>
> Then conversations between people from different teams over lunch is valuable inter-team communications that saves time spent in meetings.
>
> Honestly, free food is a bargain.
>
> At one place where I worked, we had free soda - and some upper level manager decided that too many people were only drinking half a can and throwing the rest away. So he had 25 cent soda machines installed.
>
> The time that was wasted while people ran round trying to find change - and the disruption and distraction when people had to ask other people for change was INSANE.
>
> One lower level manager took to bringing in $20 worth of quarters for his team to use (out of his own pocket) and dumping them into a “FREE SODA MONEY” jar in the break room just to restore sanity.
>
> The few bucks (at MOST) per employee per day for people paid $100/hour was stupid. The soda machines only had to waste a couple of minutes per person per day to be a net loss to productivity.
>
> So - this small expense is a bargain.
