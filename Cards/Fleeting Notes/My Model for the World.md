# My Model for the World
Ultimately, [[Welfarism]]. I want ideas to win (see [[Meme Theory]]) and that an ideal world that maximizes the good has a better distribution of people who hold certain ideas  and act upon them.

Specifically for me, this is [[Utilitarianism]]. I think pop culture gives it too strong of a bad rap and a lot of people would update towards it if they were presented it in a logical way.

I also think that [[Effective Altruism]] is highly misunderstood or underrated. An ideal world that maximizes the world would have a lot more peopel who happen to believe in at least a subset of EA ideas and act upon them.
