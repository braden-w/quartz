# 2022-04-29 EAGx Prague Application

## Imagine the event(s) You Are Applying to has/have Gone Exceptionally Well for You. What Will Have Happened?
Since the conference takes place right after the school year, I will have additional time to spend time networking. Specifically, I will have exchanged numerous ideas for Yale EA's summer plans: in addition to running the summer fellowship, I am thinking about locking down speaker events for the 2022-2023 school year in advance, preorientation program for rising first-years, as well as our workshops, so that our group is able to hit the ground running when the school year begins.

## Please Briefly Describe Your Current Approach to Improving the World. *
Showing compassion to others and trying to understand their beliefs using a scout mindset. Empathy is not just emotional, but cognitive, and I hope to use this to help share the ideas of EA. My involvement in Yale Effective Altruism is integral to my impact to the world.

## Which of the Actions You Chose Above Was the Most Significant to You? Briefly, Please Outline How Your Understanding of EA Ideas Led You to Take This Action.
Becoming a primary organizer for Yale Effective Altruism. As fellowship manager and board manager, I was responsible for organizing and executing the fellowship program, speaker series, and incoming first-year students programming this year. From my understanding of EA Ideas, the opportunity to serve in YEA seemed to be a great way to leverage my comparative advantage in leadership (specifically, I was student council president for a 3500-student high school for four years) and introduce EA to students. Particular emphasis on a mix of fellowship programs, which elicits commitment from students, and workshop and incoming student events, which are more hitscan in approach.
