# The Case for Carbon Tax
> We should try economists' favorite solution: the carbon tax.

> Economists overwhelmingly love the carbon tax, calling it "very close to the economic ideal," because it gives us a desperately-needed incentive to discourage corporations' wildly unsustainable polluting, while also letting those corporations figure out how to maintain their services most efficiently. The biggest problem with a carbon tax has never been paying for it (by definition it pays for itself). Instead, the problem has always been convincing corporate lobbyists the public that it's worth a try. After all, the automotive industry pushed the US into near-total dependence on infrastructure designed for cars. Raising gas prices is really bad PR.

> [[Universal Basic Income|UBI]] is a great idea in principle, guaranteeing everyone an economic floor / safety net while preventing unhelpful disincentives like the "welfare cliff." However, the biggest question about [[Universal Basic Income|UBI]] has always been "How you gonna pay for it?" Even though the question is usually asked in bad faith, it is a reasonable question. The last thing we want is to increase inflation even more by drastically increasing the amount of currency circulating in the economy.

> The best solution to both policies' problems is to combine them into the [[Carbon Dividend]], which Scientific American called "A Win-Win for People and the Climate." The idea is to tax fossil fuel emissions (ideally at the point of extraction) and equally redistribute 100% of funds raised among the people. The Carbon Dividend completely answers UBI's "how we gonna pay for it" question -- we just redistribute the tax funds -- and solves the carbon tax's marketing problems by giving everyone the money they need for transportation.

> Edit: Oh, and for the record, the idea that [[Universal Basic Income|UBI]] will disincentivize work is worse than groundless. Threatening people with homelessness and starvation if they don't sell their labor is not only inhumane but also unneeded. Psychological research on poverty and motivation can help us understand what makes people work or not. Research suggests that labor is also motivated by social status, by desire for comfort, by desire for meaning/purpose, etc., etc. Keeping people fed and sheltered may actually make people more motivated to work and to work better, because the stress and health damage of deprivation typically undercuts cognitive function -- including motivation to work!

> Empirically, one long-term study found that "basic psychological need satisfaction was related to work motivation over time and not the other way around." So, satisfying people's basic needs increases motivation to work. Also, a review of 16 experiments found that

> Edit 2: Added 3 more sources showing the economist consensus supporting carbon taxes and the carbon fee-and-dividend.
