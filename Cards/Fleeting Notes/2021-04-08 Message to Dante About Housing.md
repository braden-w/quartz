# [[2021-04-08]] Message to Dante About Housing
Hey Dante, how r u doing? Been talking with the guys and it seems like we got everyone locked in for a doubles-singles switch after the semester and you can be guaranteed a single üëç would you be available to take room ___ as a single? Here are the downsides: it‚Äôs a bit smaller than the original room Braden randomly selected earlier. If you really want a larger single, we can try to coax one of the others to make the switch and take a smaller single. The upside is that everyone will be able to switch, and you‚Äôll be able to get a single for both semesters. How does that sound? Let me know what you think. Excited for housing configurations and [[Hope That This Suites Us All Well]] (ha get it)
