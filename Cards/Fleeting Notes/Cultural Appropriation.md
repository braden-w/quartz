# Cultural Appropriation
Are we just salty that people are accepting? I feel like if I was to pick a world where people liked dumplings or didn't , I would much rather have the first. How do we know weâ€™re not just leaning into minority status because it advantages us or are just salty about our upbringing and find it jarring that people suddenly like our culture?
