# How Spotify Is Changing Our World Forever - YouTube

## Record Labels Screw Over Spotify and Small Artists
- Record Labels forced Spotify to completely change their business model, and move most of their free feature behind a paywall
	- And those Record Labels get huge chunks from that payment
- Record Labels also have full control over the playlists, which punishes small artists
	- Artists only get 0.0033 per play

## Spotify's Dark Turn
- [[Goldman Sachs]] poisoned Spotify once they invested
- Spotify needs to license their own content, to compete with other record labels
	- Use of [[Artificial Intelligence]] to create new content
	- Becoming another record label, censoring and playing to the whims of investors
	- The Joe Rogan acquisition
		- Then Spotify censored even more
- Selling user data
