# 2022-04-24 YEA Special Projects Team Recruitment Message
Hey y'all! Want to get more involved in YEA leadership? I'm currently accepting members for the Board, aka Special Projects Team!:bulb:

The Special Projects Team is an action-oriented team for YEA members who believe in using creativity and leadership to do the most good. Our mission is to generate entrepreneurial initiatives for YEA that expand the movement in innovative directions. Projects include expanding YEA's online and social media presence, speaker events, socials, career workshopping, and existential risk and longtermist presence.

Entry has one requirement: you must be able to attend at least two 90-minute coworking sessions per week during the 2022-2023 School Year. For flexibility, we will hold at least three 90-minute sessions per week (to be determined in a Doodle Calendar Poll). This is on par with leadership for other clubs, for a total for 3 hours a week.

If you are interested in joining, please fill out this form and join on Slack!
