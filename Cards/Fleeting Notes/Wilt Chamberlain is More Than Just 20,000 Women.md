# Wilt Chamberlain is More Than Just 20,000 Women
- He respected women and the 20,000 women number is most likely false. He refused to sleep with married women and didn't marry in part because he knew he didn't want to be unfaithful while on the road.
- His publisher insisted that he keep this number in the book
- He did lots of work for women supporting groups, although these withdrew support for him after the 20,000 women
- He suffered a lot from racism, often seen as the "villain" in the sport compared to others such as Jerry West. When he got lots of points, he was considered a ball hog. When he started passing more and getting more assists, he was criticized for not scoring.
- He wasn't an underdog, and people often were drawn to watch him fail
- "When West lost, it was a tragedy. When Wilt lost, it was a shame. Not that he lost, but that he had all that size and strength and still couldn't get the job done".
- His stats and achievements are often overshadowed by this 20,000 number
