# Boring Advice Repository - LessWrong
Some Highlights
- When in need of a conversation topic, ask a question about the other person's life. Anything about their life. (If I can't think of something else, I ask about weekend plans.) Listen for what part of their answer they're most interested in. Ask followup questions about that thing. Repeat as necessary.
	- People like to talk about themselves. This cuts awkward silences down to nothing and makes people like you. I've also learned all sorts of fascinating things about my acquaintances.
- Live close to [[Commute]] short
- [[Summary First, Then Content]]
- Never post a web link that requires readers to click on it to find out if they want to click on it.
- The [[80-20 Rule]] is especially true for cleaning. Better to get it 80% clean twice as often than 99% clean half as often.
- Always negotiate on salary, i.e. ask for more than their initial offer. [Patrick McKenzie explains why.](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/)
