# Neom is 100 Miles of Real Estate clichés.

## Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is Building a Fantasy City in the Desert. Or is He?
> On the surface, the comparison checks out: Like a pyramid, a line is a shape. This Line is in a planned desert community called Neom, mashing together the Greek word for “new” with an “M” for the prince’s given name. It’s larger than anything around—the length of Long Island and the height of the Empire State Building, containing the population of New York City. When future explorers find its dulled edges jutting up from the carbon-heated sea, they will wonder what the hell it was all about.

> So why does this shimmering desert arcology, whose latest designs were unveiled last week, feel so familiar? Largely because I have been gorging myself on the promotional copy on [Neom.com](https://www.neom.com/en-us), a stew of buzzwords so thick it may take me a while to recover my capacity for original thought. The Line, the kingdom tells us, is bringing value to the world through work-life balance, legacy-free urbanism, enhanced livability, leisure and sports, vertical living, next-gen architecture, walkable communities, and environmental solutions. Am I in a Martian colony or in Hudson Yards?

> This uncanny blend of eye-catching renderings and mind-numbing jargon permeates every aspect of the project. Neom is bin Salman’s effort to create a city from scratch. It includes a floating cargo port, Oxagon, with an uncertain number of sides, and a ski community built around a manmade lake, called Trojena. The renderings are straight out of a Marvel movie, and no surprise there: The crown prince [is a fan](https://slate.com/culture/2018/04/saudi-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-wants-to-be-black-panthers-tchalla-so-badly.html). According to Vivian Nereim’s [delightful feature in BusinessWeek](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-mbs-neom-saudi-arabia/) about the project, he’s hired Hollywood designers and encouraged them to adopt a “cyberpunk” aesthetic. Here too, the language does not quite measure up to the imagery: Trojena, which sounds like an erectile dysfunction medicine, will be made up of six districts, called Gateway, Discover, Valley, Explore, Relax, and Fun.

> And then there is the Line, which packs several voguish tenets of contemporary urbanism—car-free! Five-minute city!—into a colossal superstructure that the world’s richest NUMTOT calls “zero-gravity urbanism.” It looks to have all the walkable charm of a new airport, and the scale will pose challenges inside and out. If similarly sized cities are any guide, moving the Line’s millions every day could require a hundred subway lines, all running on the same axis. In a rendering released by Neom, the Line looms ethereal over a Red Sea bay. Not pictured: Several migratory bird species, unconscious and extinct, lying at the base of its mirrored walls.
