# [[2022-07-24]] Texts with Yvonne About [[Confrontation]]
Braden Wong:
	awww no worries Yvonne ðŸ˜Š
	no matter what, you are a wonderful t-rex and confrontation or no confrontation, it doesnâ€™t change that

Yvonne Bee:
	also my friend (poc) emily is the sweetest
I got her groupme txt on how she loves my photos and captions esp the one where I compared the bronte dress to hers
ironically sent after our convo LOL
	also thank u for the advice and hanging out w me even tho u broke ur knees Lmfao
i was getting v tense and like panicy bc confrontation is hard
I learned a lot from u today and I think Brianna did too

Braden Wong:
	If thereâ€™s only one takeaway I would say see confrontation as a way to improve the situation, not attack the person! Work together with the person to find a mutually beneficial agreement
	Confrontation should be wholesome and positive, if you have the right mindset
	I donâ€™t expect it to be easy at all, and it will take time. Just take little steps where you can, and if it doesnâ€™t work out donâ€™t worry about it too much! Weâ€™re all learning as we go
