# Man's Not Hot
A defiant piano chord resounds, its reverberations whispering through punctuated echos. A set of horns and occasional growl join its singular chorus. The combined voices escalate until finally, after 15 seconds of buildup, a stern figure dons his North Face jacket and thunders, “Two plus two is four // Minus one that’s three, quick maths.”

The music video of "Man's Not Hot" by British comedian rapper Michael Dampaah, also known by his stage name Big Shaq, is a cognitively dissonant blend of bewilderment, hilarity, and occasional revelation for an average American listener. Upon first listen, I constantly asked myself "what am I watching?" and "why am I watching this?" while struggling to contain my laughter. Unfortunately, this hilarious exterior is a fascade that many listeners will never bother to unwrap. Once I abandoned my American preconceptions, I was shocked by the depth I uncovered. Beyond its superficially funny exterior, "Man's Not Hot" is a surprisingly nuanced and endearing commentary of UK rap and ganster culture.

Audibly, "Man's Not Hot" is a sensational and laughably lyricized adaptation of UK drill. A dark frenetic energy pervades the piece, with fast-tempo snares, hard hitting kicks, and dark melodies setting a somber timbre. Over this confrontational setting, Big Shaq recounts various escapades with his crew, from his buddy "Aznee" holding the "pumpy" to a shootout that sent men "ducking" when "the ting went quack, quack, quack." As his chorus, he narrates his song’s namesake: his refusal to take off his jacket at “the girl”’s request because "man's not hot." The immediate implication? Big Shaq is too cool to take off his jacket.

Amid this lyrics, Big Shaq's cool delivery unearths an elusive line between unabashed sincerity and comedic embellishment. His delivery is coarse and forcefully enunciated, quite literally “spitting” his lyrics with an affected seriousness and British tinge that is funny but not incongruous to the category. In between lines, he slings ad-libbed sound effects, including the now-iconic "skrrat, skidi-kat-kat," that are supposed to be musical but sound awfully comedic. You cannot help but notice how the song is rife with this exaggerated onomatopeia, and start to doubt yourself. You can tell he has a British accent, but can’t convince yourself if it’s authentic. You think he is serious, but after hearing Big Shaq do “quick maths” with “Two plus two is four” and brag about his man carrying a “frisbee,” you really just can’t be sure. The deep thuds of 808 kicks bellow behind all of this, as if adding credence to his accounts. If Big Shaq is a joke, how come there is no video of him breaking character and being Michael Dampaah?

Visually, Big Shaq’s music video expounds this contrast between high production value and desultory composition. The background is distinctly summer and tropical, featuring a bright turquoise ocean and beach rife with palm trees. Big Shaq stares into the camera with a cool ferocity, befitting of his enormous North Face jacket, while uttering "rap tingz". However, the stellar camera work is pieced together in dizzying fashion. While Big Shaq is rapping, cinematic B-Rolls flash on the screen randomly, jumping to various cuts in one-second intervals. The resulting haphazard mix, in contrast to Big Shaq’s irrefutable glare in the camera, seems manufactured with a short attention span.

There is some ineffable quality to Big Shaq’s delivery, perhaps his pompous assertiveness, that prevents all of this from feeling dissonant or forgettable. The entire song appears to be a joke, hopefully one that is self-aware and basks in it. The song’s grandiose nature, accentuated by Dampaah's self-serious delivery yet apparent apathy to the creative process, gives it a hilarious effect. The result is a song that sounds lyrically and visually random—choruses of “man’s not hot” interspersed among disparate stories—though not shapeless or lacking soul.

For most listeners, the depths of "Man's Not Hot" stop as a humorous internet meme with over 400 million views on YouTube. But make no mistake, "Man’s Not Hot” is a layered masterpiece laden with British pop culture references . With research, there ’s more to “Man’s Not Hot” than its catchy chorus and absurdist delivery. 

Behold the existential-crisis-inducing adventure of . You run a quick Google Search. It begins with the realization that the obvious mathematical statement is a parody on South London rappers who had incorporated coded mathematics into their lyrics. The song is teeming with London slang, from "uckers" to "cornflakes" (where multiple slang definitions are plausible) and Jamaican patois such as "you done know". Then, you realize that Big Shaq’s infamous line, "the ting goes skrrrahh, pap, pap, ka-ka-ka / skidiki-pap-pap, and a pu-pu-pudrrrr-boom / skiya-du-du, kiya-ku-ku," is a parody of London lyrical trends, refering to the phrase “the ting goes” popularized by British rappers Stormzy and Fekky, the obviously absurd sound effects making jabs at other rapper's lyrics. These lines are not just over-the-top gunshot onomatopoeias, but direct callouts of London rapping culture.

Finally, you realize that your immediate interpretation—that Big Shaq’s body must be cool and is never hot—is completely and horribly wrong, because the song's premise is centered around Big Shaq being a “roadman” rather than “perspiration tings.” Big Shaq is a parody of a “roadman,” gangsters in the UK who are known for wearing puffer jackets regardless of the weather as protection from knife attacks. You realize that the visual absurdity of his jacket completely makes sense. Big Shaq’s North Face jacket is an icon

Dampaah's mainstream work is British-tinged far deeper than his accent implies, and you realize Dapaah is not only speaking to his audience, but a very specific British subculture, one that you increasingly start to understand and unpack. What were initially funny senseless words are actually deeply layered British inside jokes, a bold statement interweaving concepts inaccessible from anywhere else.

You feel pride at having understood a facet that few of Dampaah's listeners have ever reached.  You realize that "Man's Not Hot" confronts its listeners with two unique challenges: first to contain their laughter, then to grasp the lyrics.

What appears to be a bland, mainstream, and nonsensical jab at rap lies a surprisingly lyrically audacious and clever satire of the posturing and machismo often found in British rap music and gangsters. "Man’s Not Hot” is a layered masterpiece laden with British pop culture references that would be inaccessible if you’re not from the UK.
