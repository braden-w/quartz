## Imagine the event(s) You Are Applying to has/have Gone Exceptionally Well for You. What Will Have Happened?
During the event, I will extensively seek one-on-ones. If done exceptionally well, I will have had at least 3 one-on-ones with other student organizers, and ideally 3 one-on-ones with currently working EAs. Compared to previous events, I forsee that the topics exchanged will focus a lot on perspectives on EA for the masses/average person and the fact that EA has recently received lots of mainstream attention.

## Please Briefly Describe Your Current Approach to Improving the World. *
Showing compassion to others and trying to understand their beliefs using a scout mindset. Empathy is not just emotional, but cognitive, and I hope to use this to help share the ideas of EA. My involvement in Yale Effective Altruism is integral to my impact to the world.

## Which of the Actions You Chose Above Was the Most Significant to You? Briefly, Please Outline How Your Understanding of EA Ideas Led You to Take This Action.
Becoming an organizer for Yale Effective Altruism. As fellowship manager and board manager, I was responsible for organizing and executing the fellowship program, speaker series, and incoming first-year students programming this year. From my understanding of EA Ideas, the opportunity to serve in YEA seemed to be a great way to leverage my comparative advantage in leadership (specifically, I was student council president for a 3500-student high school for four years) and introduce EA to students. Particular emphasis on a mix of fellowship programs, which elicits commitment from students, and workshop and incoming student events, which are more hitscan in approach.
