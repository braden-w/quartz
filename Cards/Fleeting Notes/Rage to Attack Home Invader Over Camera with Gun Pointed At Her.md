title: Rage to Attack Home Invader Over Camera with Gun Pointed At Her
---

# Rage to Attack Home Invader Over Camera with Gun Pointed At Her
A woman complied with a [[Home Invasion|Home Invader]].

The camera was what enraged her (see [[Rage]] and [[Why Would the Brain Evolve or Keep Such a Self Destructive Behavior?|Why We Snap]]). A rather irrational reason, considering that she had not fought until her camera (even though the threat of her other possessions, rape, and murder were not enough)

With a gun pointed at her, she let a visceral scream and fought.
