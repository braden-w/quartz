# US Ship Fire Control with CO2
An interesting little fact about American aircraft carriers during WW2, if they knew planes were coming in to attack them, and they had enough warning, they would empty the fuel lines in the ship for the aircraft and fill them with CO2 to lessen the chance of fire if the ship was hit.

Such was the case with USS Yorktown during the Battle of Midway, when the ship's radar detected incoming Japanese planes. The preventive measure was so successful that when the Japanese sent the 2nd wave to supposedly finish off the remaining 2 carriers, the Japanese attacked the Yorktown again, thinking that it's a different ship
