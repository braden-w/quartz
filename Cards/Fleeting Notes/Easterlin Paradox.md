# Easterlin Paradox
What makes the paradox a paradox is that **happiness is related to income _at a time_ (in the cross-section) but not _over time_ (in the time series).**

## Details
Based on survey questions such as:

- Taking all things together, how would you say things are these days?
- Would you say you're very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?[[1]](about:blank#fn-oiEWxQoJuscMiomKd-1)
- All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole nowadays, from one, dissatisfied to ten, satisfied?[[2]](about:blank#fn-oiEWxQoJuscMiomKd-2)
- The [[Cantril Ladder of Life]], which asks individuals to imagine a ladder with different steps where the top step is the best possible life, the bottom step is the worst possible life, and individuals are asked which step they’re on.[[3]](about:blank#fn-oiEWxQoJuscMiomKd-3)

What makes the paradox a paradox is that **happiness is related to income _at a time_ (in the cross-section) but not _over time_ (in the time series).**

To set up the paradox, let’s quickly look at the cross-sectional data first…

There are quite a few bits of evidence which suggest that richer people are happier and/or more satisfied than poorer people. The ‘classic’ result is Kahneman and Deaton ([2010](https://www.princeton.edu/~deaton/downloads/deaton_kahneman_high_income_improves_evaluation_August2010.pdf)) indicated in the figure below.

If you look at the thick dotted line, which is the Cantril Ladder of Life, you see that the higher your income the more satisfied you are. Notice too that the x-axis is logarithmic, so it doubles at each point. But if you look at positive affect, which was measured using a basket of indicators of positive emotion, then this starts to plateau around $65,000 dollars of household income. There’s a similar story for measures of stress.

What people took from this finding was that if you get richer you’ll get more satisfied, but happiness - which is distinct from satisfaction - flattens out at some point.

See [[Happiness versus Satisfaction]] and [[Money Can't Buy Happiness]].
