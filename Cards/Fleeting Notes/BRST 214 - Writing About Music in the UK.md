# BRST 214 - Writing About Music in the UK

## Week 1

### Readings
[[Pop Music|What is Pop Music?]]

### Describe This Piece for Someone Who Hasn't Heard it Before:
Idyllic, soothing, smooth, singular. **A single voice with a single accompaniment.** Over a sustained hum from a bagpipe, a voice sings, solo, which I would describe as soothing and, at times, ornamental in inflection. The tone is smooth, reminding one of smooth waves going up and down. Bagpipe interludes of varying length break these patterns, before the whole pattern is repeated.

Towards the latter half of the piece, the voice increases in excitement. These musical phrases are broken twice with the phrase "you lie," delivered conversationally and emphatically. This could imply an additional layer of meaning, perhaps political in nature. The bagpipe increases in complexity. The combination creates an interesting and unique sonic experience.

The ending is a similar sustained ending, much like the sustained bagpipes that began the piece.

Feedback
- Nice you picked up on single voice and accompaniment
- Very nice that you compared to how it's **not** contemporary music
	- It's not what it is, but what it isn't
	- Strauss
	- You can only know something in terms of what it isn't

#### Notes
- Joe's Notes
	- Like a story. The melodic structure is pentatonic, rising at first and lowering.
- Julianna's Notes
	- Strong imagery. Not just about imagery, but how you feel and the reassurance of a voice of the musician
- Isa
	- Likened to other
- Shemi
	- Lyrics—I Dreamed a Terrible Dream

	- "You" is not just about you, but "I"

> [!important]
> When stuck, tell how the music makes you feel. There is always value in that.
- Fascinated by the idea that you should like some music and dislike others
- A "Fascism of Ideas"
- The fear of being judged for musical tasts?
	- Rise of Spotify Wrapped
		- People are afraid of being jduged
	- What about Podcasts?
		- People follow podcasts, not just hits [[Podcasts Versus Music]]
- What you like is who you are
Battle of Auburn

### Regarding Bedford Square
- Four rates of British Housing
- Duke had the square set up, and allowed architects, carpenters, etc. take each estate's lease agreement
	- Created entrepreneurial innovation

### English Writing [[Seminar]] Review Format
1. Read 10 minutes
2. Discuss without author in discussion
	- Discuss positive and negative feedback

### Excluding the Writer From the Discussion
Why exclude the writer from discussion? This is to emulate that when your work is written, you will not . This simulates if you are actually being read.

Any feedback you give could distort their impression on the work, which other readers won't have the luxury of having.

>the whole mood is _transformed from quiet reassurance to liberated ecstasy_

Love this ascension

> The screams that send off the coda are the joy that has been building up throughout the entire song; all hesitation is set lose, and the coda springs to life.

Love the imagery and use of the "coda" in this excerpt. There is a transition into more technical terminology by using it in more

Note that the subsequent technical terms is **in parentheses**

Why
Is it gatekeeping?
- Isa
	- Authority
- Me
	- Familiarity—We recognize the terms
	- Association—We know that they are classics, which then leads to

## Week 3
[[2022-07-18 Reflection on SIX]]

### [Reconsidering the Spice Girls: How manufactured girl power became real | eKathimerini.com](https://www.ekathimerini.com/nytimes/1183369/reconsidering-the-spice-girls-how-manufactured-girl-power-became-real/)
> In a scene from the 1997 film “Spice World,” the Spice Girls are rehearsing for the movie’s climactic performance at the Royal Albert Hall. Dressed in their signature looks, they sway their way through one of their hits, “Say You’ll Be There,” playfully poking one another and bopping along as they perform the R&B-infused track.
>
> “That was absolutely perfect,” the music director declares when they finish, “without being actually any good.” The Girls kind of agree, and kind of don’t care.

### Analysis of the First Paragraph
- [[Show, Don't Tell]]
	- A lack of [[Abstraction]]
- Called a [[Lede]]
	- Writers understand that nobody has to read your writing
		- [[Nobody is Thinking About You. Everyone is Too Busy with Themselves to Think About You. Life is Lonely, but This is the Most Liberating Thing]]
	- We have to draw the reader in
- What are other ways you could start a paragraph? #Type/Source/Meeting
	- Me—For expository writing? A topic paragraph.
	- Professor—What are the advantages of that?
	- Me—This reminds me of an [[Abstract]] for a [[Research Paper]]. In this situation, the [[Reader]] is highly motivated. The content might be technical. In this case, an expository paragraph is especially good for technical/academic writing. You can prime your readers so that they can anticipate and be more receptive to your new ideas.
- Why use a dynamic, unintuitive [[Lede]] rather than expository paragraph?
	- Isa—You lose [[Suspense]]
	- Professor—It doesn't write for the reader. Rather, at the reader.
- Why not have a concluding paragraph? ^9c3e55
	- Unlike academic writing, it can be good to leave it inconclusive, and then leaves the reader wondering.

### BeeGees Article
- "I Mean, …"
	- Does a lot to establish tone
- Outs himself as a loser, then calls the Bee Gees losers
	- Endearing. Rather than be condescending if the author was "cool" and labels the other as uncool, it is more relatable if he is also "self-aware"
	- Professor—Paradoxical authority move
		- If you can confess a weakness to the reader, you gain a kind of authority that you are telling it straight
		- The lack of virtue signalying seems like honesty
	- Dont' just say "you're interested "

## Week 4

### [[2022-07-25]] Refections on [[Let's Talk About Love]]
![[Let's Talk About Love#Let's Talk About Love]]
- I didn't know that Celine Dion wasn't cool, and perhaps I took it taken at granted in the beginning, reading the rest of the book with the lens that she wasn't cool
- Something is cool, in part perhaps because it is rare or not generally popular
	- It is not necessarily [[Gatekeep|Gatekeeping]], but act of self-preservation and avoiding [[Cognitive Dissonance]]
- [[Most People Do Not Have Any Internal Consistency in Their Values]]. In fact, our explanations for our behaviors are often fabrications that we make to justify our behaviors in retrospect
- [[What is the Philosophical Difference Between Taste and Preference?]]
	- Where does Taste end? What if we extrapolated [[Taste]] to its logical conclusion and commit [[Murder]] if we have a [[Taste]] for it?

### Reflection on Assignment: Misunderstood Artists
- [[Epigraph]]
- The violence
> 	_“i want harry styles to fuck me so hard. i need him to choke me with his dick and suffocate me with his cum. i want to be his slut so bad. i would do anything to gag on his dick.”_
>                                                       —_@voguerem (Twitter, 23 April 2019)_

- Degradation?
- This is a very [[Gen Z]] thing to say
- The cringescape of musical artists
- [[Persona]] quite literally means mask. It is something that you can take on and off.

He uses bland wisdom and unimaginative music to ponder the basic good and bad in people around him, without once looking inward.

- Make sure you don't just use [[Evidence]] in your paragraph. Create [[Stakes]]. See [[Claim, Evidence, Warrant]]
- Being an editor. You can go in either way

#### Charli XCX Writing Tips
- Lean harder on the things she does with her music that is not mainstream
- To Adam, she doesn't sound that innovative
- Explain how she is innovative. What sounds are actually really rare?
- Inside this Trojan Horse of commercial pop sounds
- What is the heart of what Adam doesn't feel?
	- What actually isn't popish?
- There's more than meets the ear. And as a listener, I will guide you along the way
- Maybe we are taking a more objective turn. We are making an argument, at the end of the day, not just evoking suff. Chari XCX is super underrated is an argument
	- Not Wow, Braden really likes Charli XCX, but Wow, Charli XCX is really underrated

	- “Ice Cage” sounds like an ending. The resolution to a conflict. This indicates that the narrator has found calmness in the music of the video game, or the violence of the game. What is he seeking refuge from here?

## Week 6

### Writing Assignment - A New Piece

#### First Draft (My Favorite)
A continuation of [[#Describe This Piece for Someone Who Hasn't Heard it Before]]
The song is an unorthodox musical experience filled with instrumentation that give a sense that you are slowly building up, and then all at once. This is echoed with how vocals and percussion seem to lead in slowly, before panning in at full volume. In contrast, the song as a whole feels **layered** yet distinctly separated—**deconstructed**, if you will.

The song's introduction is a progressive addition of layers. The song begins with a refrain, which has a strange echoing quality, repeated four times, singularly. Upon the 5th repeat, a drum joins, and on the 6th, a deep bass guitar. By the 7th, a snare joins, in addition to kicks.

The refrain fades out, and then a piano plays, before it fades, and the guitar plays by itself. The bass guitars plays the same three notes, played ascending first, then descending. These voices fade in and out, giving the song a very straightforward organizational quality, in contrast to the sounds themselves which feel slightly alien.

A plucking guitar, and bells. A synth and the refrain reappears.

#### Other's Responses
- Cal
	- Beautiful [[Evoking the Artifact|evoking of the artifact]] through the first person. I was so blown away!
	- The voices are contorted, imparting an alien quality
	- The song sounds contorted in a way that will make you change your beliefs
- Joe
	- Suspect voice is reversed
		- Unnatural intonations and fading in and out
	- All of the instruments play a certian motif
- Giuliana
	- The prolongued introduction, evoking wavelike qualities
	- Imagine a revolving door, each instrument comes in and out

#### Remove All Adjectives and Adverbs
The song is filled with instrumentation that give a sense that you are building up, and then all at once. This is echoed with how vocals and percussion lead in, before panning in at full volume. They are played in reverse. In contrast, the song is a series of layers that are deconstructed.

The song begins with a refrain, which is repeated four times, singularly. Upon the 5th repeat, a drum joins, and on the 6th, a deep bass guitar. By the 7th, a snare joins, in addition to kicks. It is a progression as each layer is added.

The refrain fades out, and then a piano plays, before it fades, and the guitar plays by itself. The bass guitars plays the same three notes, played ascending first, then descending. These voices fade in and out, give the song a very straightforward organizational quality, in contrast to the sounds themselves.

A plucking guitar, and bells. A synth and the refrain reappears.

#### [[It's Hard to Edit Writing]]

#### Other Version
The song features instrumentation that builds up and then is suddenly played at full volume. This is echoed with the way vocals and percussion are introduced, fading in, then panning to full volume all at once. They are played in reverse.

The song begins with a refrain, which is repeated four times, without instruments. Upon the 5th repeat, a drum joins, and on the 6th, a deep bass guitar. By the 7th, a snare joins, in addition to kicks. It is a progression as each instrument is added.

The refrain fades out, and then a piano plays, before it fades, and the guitar plays by itself. The bass guitars plays the same three notes, played ascending first, then descending. These instruments fade in and out, giving the song a very straightforward organizational quality, in contrast to the sounds themselves.

### Review of Final Paper
- This is not just an argumentative essay
- What makes a [[Research Paper]] different from an [[Argumentative Essay]]?
	- You cannot always just get away with some intuitive statements
- [[ENGL 114]] always asks you to start with a [[Problem (Writing)]] in your writing
	- But it's not to beat up an artist. It's an invitation to invest in their work
