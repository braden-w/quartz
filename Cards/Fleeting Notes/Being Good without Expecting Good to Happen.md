# Being Good without Expecting Good to Happen
- Why not [[Good Things Happen to Good People]]?
- Because if [[Good Things Happen to Good People]], then everyone would be good. Being good would lose its value.
- Instead, imagine being [[Virtue Ethics|Virtuous]]. Be good, without expecting good things to happen to you
	- If you were to be good because you expect good things to happen, it would lose its goodness
- Be good knowing that you can still die young, and tragedy may still strike, and this makes being good all the more valuable. It is a choice.
