# Unsupervised Learning
No data, just labels! Learn some underlying hidden structure of the data.

Instead, one is given a data set and generally expected to find some patterns or structure inherent in it. In contrast to [[Supervised Learning]].

## Examples
Clustering, dimensionality reduction, feature learning, density estimation, etc.
