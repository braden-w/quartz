# Technologically Gifted Loners Get a Pass
“Sure, We Allow Technologically Gifted Loners Who Launch Companies in Garages to Have Any Personality They Please, but They Are the Exceptions, Not the Rule, and Our Tolerance Extends Mainly to Those Who Get Fabulously Wealthy or Hold the Promise of Doing So.”
—Susan Cain, [[Quiet]]
