#### What Were Country Houses For?
> The country house was a place for the creation and confirmation of elite identities, where the personal, political, artistic and architectural combined in the service of their owners. ‘They were’, Girouard suggested, ‘power houses – the houses of a ruling class … People did not live in country houses unless they either possessed power, or, by setting up in a country house, were making a bid to possess it.’

> The country house is arguably the strongest visual signifier of the structures of wealth and inequality that secured enormous amounts of power and privilege in the hands of a minority of men who dominated British politics and the British empire into the twentieth century

## [[2022-07-26]] Replicating Rome: The Rise of the [[Grand Tour]] and Its Impact on the Country House

### Introduction
Why build these houses? What is their purpose? What is a country house for today?

What Makes You Able to Afford This? [[Rent]], [[Banking]], [[Slavery]]. Historians have been slow to accept [[Slavery]] as a key part of country house creation. The [[Church of England]] had huge ties to [[Slavery]], for example.

There are problems with [[Rent]] and [[Agriculture]]. The [[Enclosure Act]] enabled the seizing of land in a very unfair way.

England is broken into [[County|Counties]], and each of these can be likened to a [[State]] from the [[United States]].

[[Country Houses Are Too Biographical]]. They often focus too much on carrying of [[Lineage]]. [[Petworth House]] was made by a [[Duke]], for example.

### What is the [[Grand Tour?]]
Major emphasis on Greek and Latin, as opposed to [[Classical Philosophy]]. This produced a very interesting set of [[Elite Class|Elites]] who may have been distanced from reality.

But, note that [[American]] [[Elite Class|Elites]] were modeled after the British [[Elite Class|Elites]] as well.

### British Assertiveness
British [[Elite Class|Elites]] had the assertiveness to squat on antiquities of other cultures, such as the picture of Englishmen sitting on an Egyption Obelisk.

The 18th century was filled with prejudice. People who were still Catholics, [[Recusants]], were ostracized from society.

Interestingly, 650 of the people who travelled to [[Rome]] where note [[Elite Class|Elites]].
Which [[Rome]] is being replicated?

How to understand copies. It was about signifying taste. A copy of the Raphel was a communication of the power of the image. The image was the signifier, where the cultural message was projected.
