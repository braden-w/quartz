# Can We Throw Satellites to Space? - SpinLaunch - YouTube
- See [[Centrifugual Force]] and [[Catapult]]
- Uses [[Carbon Fiber]] to swing projectile in loop in [[Vacuum]], then releasing it
- Launch at high velocity
	- Has been done before with large guns, but loop allows scaling up for larger projectiles
- [[Turbo Pumps]]
	- Like a [[Venus Fly Trap]], rotating many disks at high speed that let air out but not in
