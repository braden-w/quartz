# Why [[Flutter]] is Worse Than [[React Native]] (Code Push)

## Code Push
The ability to push changes to app without app store review.

## Comments Response
I'm sorry but I think this video focuses too much on 2 problems related to flutter and calls it a bad framework.
- The developer experience in flutter is pretty outstanding imo.
- You can build apps and UI extremely faster compared to other hybrid or native tech (Let's speed code some UIs ðŸ˜‰).
- The packages and dependencies don't eat up your storage because flutter has a global cache compared to local node modules in RN.
- In RN, you spend more time dealing with dependencies when one of them updates while flutter does it automatically for you.
- The UI is more consistent across Android/iOS and you can be assured that a button stays in its place between platforms. (Googlereflectly flutter rewrite)
- You can build complex and eye candy animations without having to worry about performance and optimisations.
- This has HUGE implications especially in this day and age when user retention is largely affected by how good the app looks and feels Flutter web is not meant for developing websites.
- It's intentions are to build web apps that can integrate inside certain pages in websites for a unique UX.
- Yes, even the hello world app is a big binary (~6mb Android APK) but a large and complex production ready app with performant animations is also under 10mb in size (after splitting the APK) And lastly, while we flutter devs absolutely miss having the code push capability, it goes against the policies set by Apple and Google.
- Sooner or later they're gonna notice and kick your app out of the stores when too many devs start using it.
- Also, is it supported for native iOS and Android development?
- By extension, native is also bad!
- While your argument is absolutely right, it fails to acknowledge the other aspects of flutter framework that gives it an edge.
Some of my arguments might also be wrong so feel free to educate me.
