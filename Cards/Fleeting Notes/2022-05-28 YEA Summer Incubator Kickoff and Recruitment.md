# [[2022-05-28]] YEA Summer Incubator Kickoff and Recruitment

## Kickoff Announcement
Welcome back and hope your breaks have been amazing! With the month of June coming up, let's kick off our incubator and work on some YEA Projects!

@channel Please fill out this Doodle poll with your weekly availability for the month of June. Some tips to make this process faster:
1. Click "sync calendar" in the top right to overlay your calendar on the poll (this makes filling it out much faster)
2. Click all squares that you are available, making them green (available)
3. For squares that you might be able to make or are unsure (or maybe less willing to attend), click them twice to make them yellow (maybe)

I will hold multiple incubator sessions per week and take attendance. I will use this record at the end of the summer to request for a EA Infrastructure fund, for the CEA Rate of $30 an hour (still working out the details of this). Note that June coincides with Summer Session A—hopefully, your schedules will be predictable around then! Please fill these out the polls with your schedules in mind.

Again, please fill out this Doodle Poll by Monday May 30! https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/b4xg6Qgb

## Slack Personal Messages
Hey Sarah! I'm kicking off the YEA Summer Incubator this week! They're going to be flexible coworking sessions where you will have time to work on YEA Projects. I'll be present to communicate and answer any questions, and other YEA members will be there to float ideas around. I'll be taking attendance so you won't need to come to all of meetings! At the end of the summer, I will apply for an infrastructure grant at the CEA rate of $30 an hour.

Is your summer still too busy for a YEA commitment? I really value your  ability to gets speakers and willing to make compromises to make it easier—even 30 minutes of your time in a week would be appreciated (you could join a fraction of the meetings). If you think you might have availability, could you join [](https://yaleea.slack.com/archives/C03F3K0L43E) and fill out the Doodle poll with your weekly availability? I just would really like to have you in the loop, and I'd be down to meet with you 1-1 some days so we can work together on it if that makes it easier!

## Slack-Wide Announcement
Hey @channel, I'm kicking off the ~YEA Summer Incubator~ this week, which is basically the YEA Board during the summer!

If you are interested in helping or building your own YEA project, this is a good way to get accountability and resources to do it. Incubator sessions are going to be flexible coworking sessions where we will dedicate time to work on YEA Projects together. I'll be present to communicate and answer any questions, and other YEA Incubator members will be there to float ideas around and have a good time. I'll be taking attendance, and we'll be using attendance to apply for a stipend for all members at the end of the summer (still working on this from my end).

Next Steps
If you're interested, please:
Join on Slack
Fill out the Doodle Poll with your weekly availability in the month of June (another will be sent out in August for Summer Session 2) by Monday, May 30
Fill out the Interest Form if you haven't already of the ares you are interested in working on
Be active in throughout the summer!
Thank you and looking forward to working with y'all!
