Ridge regression Penalizes large coeffiecients It&amp;rsquo;s just least squares with a second term As lambda approaches to infinity, we squash the coeffiecients and the variance goes down and bias goes up As lambda approaches infinity, the variance goes up and bias goes down Lasso Ridge Regression versus Lasso Leave-one-out cross-validation Bias-Variance Tradeoff Typically, omitting variables reduces bias and increases variance This is a Goldilocks problem: Can&amp;rsquo;t use too few or too many variables, just right amount Sparsity We measure the (Lack of) sparsity of $\beta=(\beta_1,&amp;hellip;,\beta_p)$ with the q-norm For both lasso and ridge regression, it&amp;rsquo;s important to standardize the features so standard deviation of each feature (column) is a constant For low dimension prediction, we can use least squares For high dimesion linear regression, we face a bias-variance tradeoff:omitting too many variables causes bias while including too many variables causes high variance Use a good subset of variables Lasso ($l_1$ regularized least squares) is a fast way to select variables If there are good, sparse linear predictors, lasso will work well</description></item><item><title>EDST 110 Foundations of Education Theory</title><link>https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/obsidian/EDST-110-Foundations-of-Education-Theory/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/obsidian/EDST-110-Foundations-of-Education-Theory/</guid><description>EDST 110 Foundations of Education Theory [[2022-09-01]] [[Critical Race Theory]] Why are parents upset?
