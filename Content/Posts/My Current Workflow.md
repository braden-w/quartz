# My Current Workflow
Currently I use a mixture of Todoist (free plan) for task tracking and Reclaim.ai for time blocking (both on free version). I use Reclaim to block very broad categories in the beginning of the week (i.e. 14 hours of class work for this week) and then during those allocated time blocks, complete my tasks in Todoist under the "Class Work" project
