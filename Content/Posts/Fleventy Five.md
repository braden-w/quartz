# Fleventy Five
The answer is no from StackExchange:
[What is fleventy five?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/835198/what-is-fleventy-five)
Fleventy-five is the perfect kind of right-sounding nonsense. The actual answer should be 135 in base ten or 87 in hexadecimal.
This is quite hilarious as Erlich improvised it on the spot and was banking on the fact that nobody would question it if he said it with absolute conviction (which is exactly what happened).
