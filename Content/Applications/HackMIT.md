# HackMIT

## What Do You Hack for?\* (max 150 words)
The thrill of discovery. There nothing quite like discovering a solution by oneself and seeing it implemented from start to finish. These moments, of immense clarity and euphoria, are what I live for.

In high school, I enjoyed math and essay writing, but programming is an entirely different beast--it allows one to create a living tangible product, one that breathes and responds to every change, until you get it just right.

## What is a Project That You've Worked on That You're Proud of?\* (max 150 words)
A Python terminal game I coded in 8th grade modeled after a game called "One Left", which I was first introduced in a leadership seminar.

The instructor offered to play volunteers, and proceeded to win each game. While these games were occuring, I attempted to reverse engineer the game, and to my delight, discovered a winning strategy using modular arithmetic (and later I would realize, dynamic programming).

Though I wasn't called on and didn't have the chance to beat him, I came back home and coded a simulation that would run in the command line. The code was probably unnecessarily complex and I spent too many hours considering special user inputs, but I'll never forget my excitement when it worked :)

## Describe the Best Team You've Ever Worked on.\* (max 150 words)
Student council in high school. The opportunity to serve 3,300 students as student body president has given me opportunities to grow, expand my interests, and push myself beyond my comfort zone.

When I first decided to run for student council, I hoped to run for a minor position—in fact, I lost four out of five middle-school elections, winning the last because it took second place. But when the clipboard landed on my lap, my jaw dropped. Every position overflowed with names except class president, where there was one—the most popular candidate, the incumbent, whom nobody dared oppose. I closed my eyes, and took a deep breath.

One decision, to run and be interested, led to a new circle of friends, a surprise victory, and a team that I call family. I am eternally grateful for student council, for it has introduced me to an entirely different perspective to leadership.

## What Would You Like to See at HackMIT, Especially Considering It's virtual?\* (max 150 words)
Scaling up. Collaboration and the exchange of ideas have defined past hackathons for me, and scaling up HackMIT to fit more teams/individuals could introduce even more ideas and opportunities to the mix. To ensure the velocity of ideas remains rapid as we scale, we could use breakout rooms and a similar team structure like past years. Having many small teams develop their own independent products and then reconvene to distill the best of their ideas is incredibly exciting.

## Favorite Social Distancing Activity? (max 150 words)
Fortunately and unfortunately, Zoom calls. I really enjoy solitude and improving myself, particularly through new habits or coursework. Zoom calls are a great respite in between sessions, where I can relate with others on ideas and how (un)productive we've been. I've enjoyed several virtual fellowships through Zoom this year, particularly in the Effective Altruism domain, where discussions have been consistently deep and enjoyable!
