## What Are the Top Three Priorities in Your Group Right Now and why?\*
- Retention: Numerous students pass through the Yale Fellowship every year, and the ability to retain a sizeable percentage of these students as more involved (board) members would lead to drastic increases in our engagement and productivity
- Career: The career element of Yale Effective Altruism draws a sizeable portion beyond our active members, and hosting relevant events about EA careers can help spread attract non-YEA members and spread EA ideas
- One on one time: The vast majority of our students commit to Effective Altruism due to their friends or one-on-one chats with board members. We are aiming to increase this number to increase recruitment

## If You Had 60 Hours to Work on Something for Your Group Over Summer What Would You Be Interested in Working on?\*
- Facilitate the new Summer Fellowship, and lay the groundwork for future fellowships
- Preparing for the extracurricular bazaar, reach out to other clubs/SOCs, and plan several introductory events that will execute in quick succession when the school year starts
