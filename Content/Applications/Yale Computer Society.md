## [[Fall 2020]]

## 1. Which CS-related Class Are You Most Excited About and Why? (150 Words Max) \*
Honestly, I'm excited for CPSC 223, as it is the entry point to a lot of real-life applications of programming and internships. I'm excited to take on the challenge of the coursework. I've studied a little bit of data structures and algorithms under the Google CSSI-Coursera program, but am in need of a more formal introduction to their concepts (and the C programming language :P).

## 2. Tell Us About Your Favorite Extracurricular of the Past Two Years. What Made it Special for You? What Did it Push You to Accomplish? What Does it Say About Who You Are? (150 Words Max) \*
Student council in high school. The opportunity to serve 3,300 students as student body president has given me opportunities to grow, expand my interests, and push myself beyond my comfort zone.

When I first decided to run for student council, I hoped to run for a minor position—in fact, I lost four out of five middle-school elections, winning the last because it took second place. But when the clipboard landed on my lap, my jaw dropped. Every position overflowed with names except class president, where there was one—the most popular candidate, the incumbent, whom nobody dared oppose. I closed my eyes, and took a deep breath.

One decision, to run and be interested, led to a new circle of friends, a surprise victory, and a team that I call family. I am eternally grateful for student council, for it has introduced me to an entirely different perspective to leadership.

## 3. Why Are You Interested in Joining Yale Computer Society? (150 Words Max) \*
The thrill of discovery. There nothing quite like discovering a solution by oneself and seeing it implemented from start to finish. These moments, of immense clarity and euphoria, are what I live for.

I enjoy math and writing, but programming is an entirely different beast--it allows one to create a living tangible product, one that breathes and responds to every change, until you get it just right. I hope to keep in touch with this side in Yale Computer Society.

## What Will Be Your Extracurricular Commitments This Semester? \*
I am currently a board member of Yale Effective Altruism (I was invited and accepted into their Summer Fellowship in senior year high school as well as the Oxford Uni In-Depth Fellowship, and have been an active member since) and am currently interested in running for Senator or FCC representative of my residential college, Yale Computer Society, Yale Machine Learning Society, YUDI, and Yale Entrepreneurial Society, although the final list will likely be far shorter.

I believe I will reliably be able to invest about 2 hours per week, with the recognition that time is generally not the primary issue but priorities. I am willing to prioritize activities as important and urgent over social or other extracurricular activities when needed.

## Spring 2022

## Why Do You Want to Join the Development Team? (50 Word minimum) *
I really enjoy building things, and hope that my experience in coding web applications in the past can be useful to YCS. Although I've coded in a team before, I haven't officially coded with Yale students before, and would really enjoy the collaborative aspect in taking on YCS Projects!

## What Are Some of the Languages You Know and What is Your Experience Level with Them? (ex: Python: Beginner, C: Competent, Java: expert)
Full Stack Web Programming (Vue, Quasar, Vuetify, PostgresSql, Firebase): Competent to Expert, Python: Competent, Git, Gitflow, Branching: Competent, Vim: Competent to Expert

## Tell Us About a Project You've Worked On.
[[Yale Buttery Book]], which has amassed 8,000+ views and been featured in the YDN and Yale Today newsletter. It's a Vue JAMStack Application (Statically Generated site hosted on Netlify CDN) with a PostgresSQL Database and separate Node.js server to automate sending emails. Also hooked up with Google Calendar API, using Google Calendar as a backend for schedules

## Tell Us About Yourself! (50 Word Minimum - Don't Write a Novel though.)
During winter break last year, I picked up front-end development with Vue, Nuxt.js, and Vuetify UI Framework, and enjoyed it so much that I coded all day—I even stopped playing video games with my friends. Since then, I have expanded to fullstack development, Node.js, PostgreSql, Flutter, etc. I've falling in love with the ability to rapidly prototype apps.

## Why Do You Want to Join y/cs? (50 Word minimum) *
I absolutely love building things--there nothing quite like discovering a solution by oneself and seeing it implemented from start to finish. These moments, of immense clarity and euphoria, are what I live for. I'm hoping to do this, collaborate with others, and work on big projects for the Yale Community in Y/CS.

## What Are You Hoping to Accomplish by Being in y/cs? (50 Word minimum) *
I really enjoy hobby projects, but also would like a formalized experience where I have the opportunity to expand beyond them in a group settings. Additionally, I actually have never built with React—I really have been looking for a reason to get into it since it's so popular in the industry! Also would really like to play with some APIs, if permitted. :D
