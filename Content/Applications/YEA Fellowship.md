## In a Few Sentences: Please Give 1 or 2 Examples That Demonstrate Your Passion for Helping Others
I met one of my friends in a spectacular display—as she ran out the door, crying, during math class. The entire class stared, the door creaking in haunting invitation. I had never met her before. After a long silence, my stomach turned.

I am grateful I made the right decision. Had I not went after her, I wouldn't have learned about her struggle with suicidal thoughts or past sexual abuse. As we sat in the hallways, tears streaming from her face, my tongue stumbling to find the words, we built a unique friendship. After many late nights of listening, comforting, and encouraging her to seek professional help, she recovered.

It is a privilege to be able to help others as president, but a blessing to be there for someone in their greatest time of need. Since meeting my friend, I have cherished relationships through a different lens. I am fortunate to say “Hi, how are you doing?” to hundreds every day, but knowing some may hear those words only once, my words need to count. I'm inspired by the greats, but driven by the grateful—though my matrix multiplication is still rusty from missing that math lecture, it's a small price to pay for a life-changing friend.

## In a Few Sentences: Are You Driven to Find Opportunities to Do as Much Good as You Can, Rather Than Being Satisfied with Doing Some Good? Support Your Answer with 1 or 2 Examples, if Possible
Finding opportunities to maximize output. I define my life not by the quantity of my successes, but the quality of my problems. (After all, why do we define others through "first-world problems" and not "first-world successes"?) As we advance, we do not deal with fewer problems, but bigger ones. Our lives will be defined by the scope of problems we choose to tackle. We revere visionaries like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates in part because they were bold enough to dare to tackle problems that many of us never imagined. It is for this reason that I am obsessed with pursuing problems rather than successes, and finding opportunities rather than outcomes.

Most failures are one-time costs, while most regrets are recurring costs. The process of discovering how to efficiently and effectively do good, however, is a recurring benefit that I will not regret, which I hope to provide theme and direction to my life.

## Please List 1-4 of the Career Paths You Are Considering, and Why
Computer Science | Data Science | Business | (Mech) Engineering

I have grown up with computers and technology. The rapid rise of AI, data science ethics, transparency, etc. also raise numerous questions about morality, a debate I wish to participate at the forefront in. I have both a humanities (writing/speaking) and physics/mathematics background from high school, and I hope to apply as these skillsets on the job. Also, I really enjoy using my hands and building things (I loved playing with Legos!).

## How Confident Are You That You Will Pursue One of These Paths? What Are Your Biggest Uncertainties?
I intend to major in Econ & Computer Science and am quite confident that I will pursue a path in technology. I am, however, uncertain which particular aspect I will pursue.

## Do You Plan to Donate a Percentage of Your Income to Charity in the Future? Want to Elaborate on Why or Why Not?
Yes. I believe in Dr. Seuss's quote, "To the world you may be one person; but to one person you may be the world," in revealing how many relationship are not necessarily reciprocal, and that a little gift from some of us could mean a lot to many of us. For example, subtracting 10% of an income of $80,000 to add to someone who makes $40,000 increases their income by 20%.

## What is an Example of Something You Have Changed Your Mind On?
The hope that there is other (easily accessible) life in the universe. Until recently, I have always thought it poetic to unite with another sentient form of life across the cosmos. However, after reading a few books, discovering the Great Filter and Fermi Paradox has qualified my excitement. It is amazing how a new perspective can change one's viewpoint so quickly. I am now much more cautious (but still hopeful) for the prospects of life elsewhere in the galaxy.

## If You Have Engaged with the Effective Altruism (EA) Movement in Any Way Previously, Please Briefly Describe How (e.g. Attended X/Y/Z Event, Read the EA Forum, etc.)
YEA Intro during Yale Bulldog Days, YEA Coronavirus Discussion, Coffee Chat with Jessica

## Is There Anything Else We Should Know?
I made a speech to several thousands during an all-school 9/11 assembly, the topic of which was about helping others and the aforementioned Dr. Seuss quote. Should it be of any help, it may be worth checking out :) [https://medium.com/optim/transcript-38a7bc389446](https://medium.com/optim/transcript-38a7bc389446)
