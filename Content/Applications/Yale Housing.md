# Yale Housing

## How Do You Think Others Would Describe You? \*
I LOVE to smile! It is definitely my most defining feature. Usually, it

is because I am very happy. Whenever people ask me why I am so

optimistic, my answer is simple: it’s a lot harder to make history

when you don’t believe in the future. I don't define my optimism as

an ignorance of facts, but a belief that I have control over my

future, and that I will make it better. I feel that spreading that sense

of control and vision with others is incredibly powerful. I live by the

motto, "To be interesting, be interested". I enjoy helping others with

compassion and helping them feel special. Even if I may have

accomplishments, when I talk to others, I never wish my

conversations to be about me, but about them.

## What Extracurricular Commitments Have Been Most Important to You? What New Activities Do You Hope to Explore at Yale? \*
In high school, my largest commitments were in student council,

Boy Scouts, math/physics/coding team, internships/business

competitions, blogging/writing competitions, and volunteering--in summary, English, STEM, and leadership/business. At Yale, I hope

to tackle philosophical questions at YEA, business/startup clubs,

writing journals, and engineering/computer science. I also am really

interested in the arts, singing, and dancing. I was the star of the

school play in elementary school, and carry with me a love and

appreciation for theater.

## What Do You Like to Do for Fun? \*
One of my brother and I's favorite pasttimes is to sit down together

in my room and watch YouTube/TV Shows with a bag of Hot

Cheetos or popcorn (we finished the entirety of Game of Thrones

and Grand which this way). Otherwise, we enjoy playing tennis and

joking around together. I occasionally play video games (though

not as much recently): Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with my

friends, Civilization V, Clash Royale, and a few other single player

games. Feeling tangible progression in a skill set is really enjoyable

for me, and I enjoy learning new things (especially because

progress in the early stages of skill development is so rapid).

During quarantine, I grinded out Harvard CS50 and a Google

Cloud Engineering course in a few days. Recently, I've gotten back

into playing piano and violin for fun. I also really enjoyed watching

Silicon Valley, which is perhaps my favorite TV show of all time.

Finally, I really enjoy tinkering, productivity hacks, and optimizing

processes! I recently made a program to generate an API request

to bulk delete I love digging into api’s, batch scripts, to-do lists, and

new approaches to automate new tasks/reduce friction for good

habits

## What is Your Greatest Concern About Coming to College? \*
Making decisions. I am interested in a lot of things and have a

tendency to overload myself (for fear of the opportunity cost), and I

hope that I can be comfortable making decisions at Yale that may

close some doors but open many more.

## What Are Your Academic Interests, and What Subjects Do You Hope to Explore at Yale? \*
Among my biggest academic interests are Economics, Computer

Science, Data Science/Statistics, Mechanical Engineering, writing,

and business. I am planning to

## What Was Your Favorite Class in High School? Why? \*
AP Statistics. I was the youngest person in the class having taken

the AP Calculus test in 9th grade, and was also somewhat the

class clown because of that fact. I had an amazing teacher, Mr.

Mynster, who was incredibly bright and the quintessential "Jack of

all trades, master of many". In fact, many years ago, he was

admitted to Harvard as an undergrad (and later as a grad), but

unfortunately went to a local college to help his family's financial

situation at the time. During lunch, we would talk for ages about

computers, politics, economics, business, math, and so much

more.

## What Kinds of Academic Assignments Do You Find Most Difficult? Why? \*
Writing. To be clear, I love math and writing. To me, math has

always been straightforward or even blunt, finding the right method

among numerous, if not innumerable, wrong ones. However,

writing is both wonderful and peculiar in rewarding the opposite:

the array of options that writing presents, limitless and many viable,

makes it a quest of finding the best way, not the right way. There is

no “finished” state, nor trick, that ultimately creates a perfect piece.

Without guidance, I often can spend many hours on a piece and

not be satsified.

## What is Important for Your College Adviser to Know About You? \*
When I first decided to run for student council, I was hoping to run

for a minor position—in fact, I lost my first four middle-school

elections, winning the last only because it took second place. All of

my friends had moved, and so during lunch, I visited the

informational meeting, partly because I had nobody to sit with. But

when the clipboard finally landed on my lap, my jaw dropped.

Every freshman council position overflowed with names, except

class president, where there was only one—the most popular

candidate, the incumbent, whom nobody dared oppose. There was

no longer a consolation “Room Representative” position if I lost. In

that moment, I took a deep calming breath, and decided to go all

in. One decision, to simply run and be interested, led to two

enthralling weeks of campaigning beyond my comfort zone,

meeting hundreds of new people, and discovering a new side to

myself. After a thrilling surprise victory, that one decision led to

years of new experiences and seeing leadership through a new

lens. Ultimately, one decision, to simply take a chance and push

my limits, taught me that those chances are almost always worth

taking. Joining student council was the biggest plot twist of my life,

and I am so grateful for the many opportunities and lessons ever

since.
