# Rotary Scholarship

## What Are Your Plans for Next Year? And Five Years From Now?
Since quarantine began, I have been ingraining my early morning ritual. Every morning at 4:30 AM, my automated lamp lights up, my wristwatch buzzes, and I wake up to tackle my "sharpening the saw" list of over 80 habits. My goal is to touch each at least once—from reading, meditating, cold showers, even singing or dancing—because one minute invested is infinitely better than zero. The wee hours of my mornings are dedicated to personal exploration. This platform of essential habits is a baseline, a constant, that I hope to continue into my college years and beyond.

Additionally, before college, I have been writing in my blog, reading, spending more time with Grandpa, and completing about one online course every other day (machine learning, cloud computing, Harvard's CS50, etc.). I also have a pile of math transcripts, online resources, speech prompts, programming projects, and piano sheet music to process in my free time.

At Yale, I hope to expand my “resumé of failures,” which I affectionately call my “pausés on successes,” for a simple reason—though a resumé impresses, I find a pausé truly inspires. For example:

-I failed tennis tryouts all three years from an excruciating hip injury, but the pain motivated me to get in the best shape of my life

-I lost five consecutive writing competitions after winning nationally in my first, then became published

-In the span of only a week, I received news that I had not advanced in 3 scholarships and 2 summer programs, and a writing competition in which I entered 8 different pieces, before receiving my college acceptances

-I lost eleven elections in elementary and middle-school, then became high-school president

To me, the biggest risk is not taking one. I am not defined by my victories, but the challenges I seek and persevere through.

I am grateful that Yale is an incredibly supportive community that encourages flexible multidisciplinary study. Currently, I plan to major in the Economics & Computer Science joint major, adding a second major in Mechanical Engineering or Data Science and Statistics. I will use my first year to explore, using Yale's "shopping period" (testing out new classes) to gauge and discover my interests.

Five years from now, I would love to innovate at the intersection of artificial intelligence and vehicular transportation—applying computer science, economics, and more—to design tools that empower others, improve safety and productivity, and build a cleaner future. Ever since I watched Top Gun when I was very young, I have been absolutely fascinated by airplanes and flight. To me, innovation is not just problem solving, but problem finding: to relentlessly pursue the challenges of tomorrow, seek problems nobody else has ever imagined before, and discover novel solutions that push humanity forward.

## Outside of Your Classes, What Activity Has Been the Most Important in Terms of Your Personal Growth? Why?
I would choose ASB, not just for invaluable leadership development, camaraderie, and countless unforgettable memories, but for teaching me my most important lesson about leadership—that one decision often leads to thousands, and we must relentlessly seek and pursue those decisions to push us to new heights.

When I first decided to run for student council, I was hoping to run for a minor position—in fact, I lost my first four middle-school elections, winning the last only because it took second place. But when the clipboard finally landed on my lap, my jaw dropped. Every freshman council position overflowed with names, except class president, where there was only one—the most popular candidate, the incumbent, whom nobody dared oppose. There was no longer a consolation “Room Representative” position if I lost. I closed my eyes and took a deep, calming breath.

3… 2… 1…

Let's go all in.

One decision, to simply run and be interested, led to two enthralling weeks of campaigning beyond my comfort zone, meeting hundreds of new people, and discovering that I love spreading happiness with others. After a thrilling surprise victory, that one decision led to years of new experiences, pushing boundaries, and seeing leadership through a new lens. Ultimately, one decision, to simply take a chance and push my limits, taught me that those chances are almost always worth taking.

From one decision to run for ASB, I've learned that decision-making is at the heart of all leadership—and that we are all leaders, because our choices, starting with our decision to get up and be present, impact countless others every day. Today, as I dance down the hallways, greeting and asking others how they are doing, I am reminded of how much I have grown—all thanks to one decision and some courageous counting.

## As a Teenager, What Do You See as Your Role in the Community? (e.g. Setting Examples, Community service)
My greatest mission is to connect and live by the Dr. Seuss quote, “To the world you may be one person; but to one person you may be the world.” I learned this after meeting one of my closest friends in a spectacular display—as she screamed, cried, and ran out the door mid-lecture during math class. The entire class stared in dead silence, the door creaking in a haunting invitation. I had never met her before. After five seconds of silence, my stomach turned.

I’m glad to have made the right decision. Had I never went after her, I would never have learned about her struggle with suicidal thoughts or past sexual abuse—and perhaps no one else would have. As we sat together in the hallways, tears streaming from her face, my tongue stumbling to find the right words, we built a friendship unlike any other. After countless late nights of listening, comforting, and encouraging her to seek professional help, she slowly yet miraculously recovered.

It is a privilege to have the opportunity to help so many students as president—but a blessing to be there for someone in their greatest time of need. Since meeting my friend, I have cherished relationships through a different lens and that Dr. Seuss quote. I am fortunate enough to say “Hi, how are you doing?” to hundreds every day, but knowing that some may hear those words only once, my words need to count—and so I am the approachable friend, someone to talk to, for those who do not always have the luxury. I'm inspired by the greats, but driven by the grateful—and though my matrix multiplication is still a bit rusty from missing that math lecture, it was a small price to pay to find a life-changing friend and mission to serve others.

## Who Do You Feel is an Outstanding Leader and Why?
Secretary: Ms. Moreno. Office Number: 3. When I tell my friends my favorite ASB memories were trips to the assistant principal’s office, I have to reassure them that I've been a good kid.

When I first joined ASB, the assistant principal, Dr. Tung, was infamous for calling in members privately in his office, closing the door, and giving blunt, often sharply delivered critiques. Many members in ASB cried—I cried three times in his office in the first week. Compared to upperclassmen, I entered ASB with far less experience, and my first month in ASB was the worst of my high school career. However, while other ASB members urged me to ignore him, I mustered the strength to visit his secretary and schedule an appointment. I would go to him, rather than have him come to me.

For four years in that office, I’ve proactively sought feedback, stomached criticism, and pitched ideas—and turned my most-feared adversary into most-trusted mentor and friend. Being proactive and open to change flipped the dynamic of our conversation, and revealed a side of him I never knew. Our feedback has gone both ways, as he shared feedback to make me a more well-rounded leader, while I have done my best to be a good student, share feedback to and from other ASB members, and be a liaison between advisors and students.

Improving advisor-student relations. Reconnecting Freshman Council. Resurrecting a school dance. Eating dinner together. With Dr. Tung, I am grateful to have had the courage to embrace a growth mindset, for it made me a better student leader, developed compassion, and taught me how to become a visionary. Dr. Tung may not be the perfect leader, but he is the leader who has brought the best in me, the mentor who pushed me beyond my comfort zone, and the friend to whom I owe my journey in leadership.

## Please Write an Essay on How Participation in Volunteer Activities Have Contributed to Your Growth as an Individual and Member of Your Community?
Every day, two crisp gavel taps commence bustling ASB business meetings. Light keyboard clacks ring in quiet math team meetings. Faint scribbles on my writing notebook break the peaceful solitude in my room. I see the world through many lenses, constantly shifting between left and right brain, social and individual, and practical and theoretical, to create ideas worth sharing. However, no volunteer activity has ultimately impacted me more than student council, not just for invaluable leadership development, camaraderie, and countless unforgettable memories, but teaching me an important lesson about leadership—that one decision often leads to thousands, and we must relentlessly seek and pursue those decisions to push us to new heights.

To me, the Albert Matthies Memorial scholarship is not about me or my accomplishments, but what I will do for others, my values, and ultimately, my journey as a leader. From one decision to run for ASB to one decision to meet a new friend, I've learned that decision-making is at the heart of all leadership—and that we are all leaders, because our choices, starting from our decision to get up and be present, impact countless others every day.
