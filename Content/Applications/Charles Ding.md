My apologies for the delay. I hope my response may answer your questions fully and in a timely fashion.

1. I believe my diverse set of extracurricular activities and leadership, along with a 4.0 GPA and strong test scores, aided my application. I took the Wharton School's "Leadership in the Business World", one of the most selective business summer programs in the nation, which is a huge boost to applying to the Wharton School and other business schools.

	However, strong extracurriculars and test scores do not guarantee admissions to top colleges. I always could have spent more time writing my college essays. There are always many amazing students applying to these schools, and I am very happy for their success. I am grateful to have been waitlisted to other schools, as it makes the decision to go to Yale even easier!

	Though I was hesitant when I first visited Yale last summer, I was blown away by the amount of attention Yale invests in each of its students and the enthusiasms their professors have in teaching. Many of the graduate professors teach undergraduate students in their own time for free, eat with them in their free time, and focus on teamwork in classes rather than competition. The community they create is unparalleled. Students are extremely happy!

	Yale's College Visits are called "Bulldog Days", a famed 3-day weekend of fun for all students. Due to virus concerns, the event has been moved to a 30 day virtual Bulldog Days event. The event has been amazing in promoting Yale and friendship between students.

	I am planning to major in Economics and Computer Science, given my background in Business and STEM. Yale's literary arts department is also very strong and so I hope to pursue writing there.

2. The advantage to early action/early decision programs an increased chance of admission and possibly less work for the student if accepted. However, I would only recommend early decision if a student is ready to submit and they really desire a certain school. Sometimes, it is better to use extra time to polish your application and wait for regular admissions. Additionally, an early decision contract binds the student to the school, meaning they cannot change their mind. Finally, if a student gets rejected for early decisions, they may feel very sad and find difficulty to be motivated to complete regular decision applications.

	My personal recommendation, would be to early action a few schools and after that, make changes to your application to polish them for regular decision. Regular decision allows a student to consider many schools, weigh their financial aid options, and most importantly, enjoy opening many letters at once (the "Ivy Day experience"). I would not personally recommend early decisions as they limit your options and could make you too excited for a single school, which could be heartbreaking if you don't get in.

3. As I mentioned earlier, I believe I had a diverse set of extracurricular activities and leadership, along with a 4.0 GPA and strong test scores, that was an advantage.

	I took the SAT in 8th Grade and received a 1560, ACT in 11th grade and received a 36, and 15 AP Exam Scores total (I took 9 in my Junior year, and self-studied AP Calculus BC, Calculus AB, and Chemistry in my freshman year).

	My biggest extracurriculars include:

	- Student Council President (Grades 9-12)
	- Boy Scouts Troop Founder/Eagle Scout
	- National Scholastics Art and Writing Silver Medalist
	- National AIME Qualifier
	- Gold President's Volunteer Service Award
	- Elk's Lodge Most Valuable Student National Finalist (Top 500 Nationally)
	- Coca-Cola Semifinalist
	- Published in the Noteworthy Journal
	- National Merit Finalist
	- Physics Team Member and Math Team Secretary (9-12)
	- Wharton School's Leadership in the Business World Summer Program
	- Anything else from my LinkedIn could work.

	I don't wish to make my extracurriculars the highlight of my personality. There are many students who are more accomplished than I am. I do, however, hope to inspire others to know what is possible.

	Additionally, I have a story some people may find interesting. I lost every student council election in middle school except one, and never imagined becoming the high school president. In high school, I planned to run for a less major position, but the slots were full and I was forced to run for president. One decision to run for ASB changed my life.

Unfortunately, my family has not decided on a Chinese name for me yet.

Please let me know if you have any more questions and I would be happy to answer them. Wishing you the best.

Sincerely,

Braden
