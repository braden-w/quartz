# 2022-03-25 GCP Summer Internship Application

## Why Do You Want to Do This Internship with Us? *
I am drawn to creating entrepreneurial initiatives in community building and believe that strong college communities are the backbone of a thriving EA community. Having spent time with Emma during the Boston organizer retreat last year, I was drawn by her advice to become more entrepreneurial. Since then, I have been sought to push previous norms during my time served as the YEA fellowship manager and organizing team/board manager.

In my opinion, Yale Effective Altruism is at a crucial inflection point, in which our number of members is increasing while the core leadership team has remained about the same in size. In addition to doubling the intro fellowship size from previous years, I've been identifying high-impact students who have both willingness and capacity to take ownership of large new initiatives that expand YEA into different branches and expands our ability to capture engagement of these members. This is all uncharted territory—while I have significant experience in managing large teams, I have much to learn about how to be a supportive advisor and resource for the next generation of leaders. I am still young—only a sophomore—but would like to gain perspective to lead these initiatives in the future.

I admire the GCP's dedication to the vision of building a pipeline and central location for EA resources. Through this internship, I hope to gain practical experience in community organizing and specifically, gain the boldness to take calculated risks when I return to YEA. Additionally, I want to support Emma and her vision for this internship program. I believe that it has the potential to empower young people and help them to realize their own potential. I am excited to be a part of this program and to help make a difference in the lives of others.

## Which of Our Projects Would You Be Excited to Work On? *
I'm super interested in working with Emma! Having spent time with her during the Boston organizer retreat last year, I was drawn by her vision of bringing new entrepreneurial initiatives in the community building space. Otherwise, I am interested in working on the GCP Student Handbook!
