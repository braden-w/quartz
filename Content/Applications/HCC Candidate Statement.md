# HCC Candidate Statement
Hey everyone! My name is Braden Wong, a first-year running to be YOUR Hopper representative! I hope your past few weeks together have been awesome, and most of all, that you feel genuinely connected with your peers! I believe in the power of community, and will do my best to support you and foster it in the months to come :) I’m excited to see what our future has in store!

Now, on to experience! In high school, I served four years as student council president on behalf of 3,300 students. Not only did the experience give me opportunities to grow, lead ambitious spirit events, and master parliamentary procedure, but it taught me an important lesson about leadership—that one decision often leads to thousands, and one decision is all it takes to push us to new heights.

When I decided to run for high school student council, I hoped to run for a minor position—in fact, I lost four out of five middle-school elections, winning the last only because it took second place. But when the clipboard landed on my lap, my jaw dropped. Every position overflowed with names except class president, where there was one—the most popular candidate, the incumbent, whom nobody dared oppose. I closed my eyes, and took a deep breath.

3…2…1…

One decision, to simply run and be interested, led to two enthralling weeks of campaigning, a surprise victory, and years of new experiences. I've learned that decision-making is at the heart of all leadership—and that we are all leaders, because our choices, starting with the decision to get up and be present every morning, impact countless others every day.

I wish you the absolute best as you pick your candidates. Let’s remember that we are all leaders, and together, let’s make a difference!
