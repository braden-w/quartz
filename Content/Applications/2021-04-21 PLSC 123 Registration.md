## Have You Taken Any Previous Courses, or Had Any Non-classroom Experience, That Might Be Related to This Course?
Yes; I am an active board member, webmaster, and first-year liason of Yale Effective Altruism! I have also been a member of the Yale Effective Altruism and Oxford In-Depth fellowship, which covered similar topics in seminar-style discussion. Have not taken any courses specifically related to this topic, so this will be the first one!

I have been fascinated with the question, "How can we do the most good with our resources?" In Effective Altruism, we frequently discuss the effectiveness of solutions to existential and large-scale problems, among them being global poverty and pandemic preparedness in developing countries. I hope that this course may help me explore this concept with greater depth. Not only is it highly relevant to the discussions and questions I would like to solve, but it is aligned with my desire to participate in forms of foreign aid in the future.
