# GRC Yale 2020-2021 Application

## Hobbies \*
Deep discussions and catching up with friends, productivity hacks, reading, tennis, mountain biking, singing, dancing, playing the piano/violin, video games with friends

## Tell Us About Your History with Social Impact or Service Work. (Max 150 words) \*
I hope that my experiences and skillsets serve GRC well in helping and enabling others.

In high school, I served four years as class and student council president (school size 3,300). During that period, my primary responsibilities included leading planning for all school and class-wide spirit events, administering biweekly parliamentary procedure business meetings, representing the student body in bimonthly Board of Education & PTSA meetings, supporting athletic and performing arts events, and ensuring wellness of student council members.

I founded and enjoyed 7 years in my Boy Scouts troop, serving in numerous service projects and various leadership positions up to Senior Patrol Leader (president). During that period, I helped connect our troop to monthly service projects with the Arcadia Elks Lodge.

I also cold-emailed and served an internship under the city manager, where I formed a student team to hand-create a website (HTML, JS, CSS, PHP) used to survey the city before city council meetings.

## Describe a Team You've Worked on in the Past, and the Role You Played on That Team. (Max 250 words) \*
Student council in high school. The opportunity to serve 3,300 students as student body president has given me opportunities to grow, expand my interests, and push myself beyond my comfort zone. In addition to the experiences and roles above, it taught me an important lesson on leadership–that one decision often leads to thousands, and we must relentlessly pursue those that push us to new heights.

When I first decided to run for student council, I hoped to run for a minor position—in fact, I lost four out of five middle-school elections, winning the last because it took second place. But when the clipboard landed on my lap, my jaw dropped. Every position overflowed with names except class president, where there was one—the most popular candidate, the incumbent, whom nobody dared oppose. I closed my eyes, and took a deep breath.

One decision, to run and be interested, led to a new circle of friends, a surprise victory, and a team that I call family. I am eternally grateful for student council, for it has introduced me to an entirely different perspective to leadership.

## Why Do Social Impact Consulting and GRC Yale Interest You? (Max 250 words) \*
I am drawn to the opportunity to collaborate and create impact. This summer, I've been involving myself in numerous ways to learn more about ethics and how to do  good most effectively in the world. Although I'm a first year, I am currently a board member of Yale Effective Altruism (I was invited and accepted to their and Oxford Uni's In-Depth fellowship this summer). I hope to blend my experiences in YEA and GRC to identify and learn more about how to increase my social impact. I enjoy enabling others and the journey for growth, and am excited to learn along the way!

## What Other Commitments Do You Hope to Be Involved with This Semester? How Much Time Would You Reasonably Be Able to Set Aside for GRC Work? (Open-ended) \*
I am currently a board member of Yale Effective Altruism (I was invited and accepted into their Summer Fellowship in high school and have been an active member since) and am currently interested in running for Senator or FCC representative of my residential college, Yale Computer Society, Yale Machine Learning Society, and Yale Entrepreneurial Society.

I believe I will reliably be able to invest about 3 hours per week for GRC work, with the recognition that time is generally not an issue but priorities. I am willing to prioritize GRC projects as important and urgent over social or other extracurricular activities when needed.

## (Optional) Background or Interests You Want Us to Consider When Placing You in a Team?
I am particularly interested in ethics, effective altruism, and the opportunity to collaborate and create impact. I hope that my experiences and skillsets serve ShARE well in helping and enabling others.

This summer, I've been involving myself in numerous ways to learn more about ethics and how to do good most effectively in the world. Although I'm a first year, I am currently a board member of Yale Effective Altruism (I was invited and accepted into their Summer Fellowship in senior year high school as well as the Oxford Uni In-Depth Fellowship, and have been an active member since). I hope to blend my experiences in YEA and ShARE to identify and learn more about how to increase my social impact. I enjoy enabling others and the journey for growth, and am excited to learn along the way!

## What Other Groups Will You Be Involved in This Semester? \*
I am currently a board member of Yale Effective Altruism (I was invited and accepted into their Summer Fellowship in senior year high school as well as the Oxford Uni In-Depth Fellowship, and have been an active member since) and am currently interested in running for Senator or FCC representative of my residential college, Yale Computer Society, Yale Machine Learning Society, YUDI, and Yale Entrepreneurial Society, although the final list will likely be far shorter.

I believe I will reliably be able to invest about 5 hours per week, with the recognition that time is generally not an issue but priorities. I am willing to prioritize ShARE activities as important and urgent over social or other extracurricular activities when needed.
