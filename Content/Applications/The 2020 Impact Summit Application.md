# The 2020 Impact Summit Application

## What Would You Like to Get Out of This Year's Summit?
Exploring deep topics, especially in the realms of artificial intelligence ethics, global priorities research, and public policy. I was recently introduced to Effective Altruism (it's how I discovered this summit), and really enjoy topics in their cause areas!

## As Part of This Year's Impact Summit, We'll Be Giving the Opportunity for Participants to Give Their Own mini-TED Talks! If You Were to Give a 5-minute Talk, What Would it Be About?
I hope to tackle the scarcity mindset, an issue that I believe is both neglected and keeping many citizens from engaging with global issues.

It is very difficult to worry about the world when your livelihood is under direct threat. As a Chinese proverb goes, “When there is food on the table there are many problems. When there is no food on the table there is one problem”.

According to a recent survey from Charles Schwab, 59% of Americans live from paycheck to paycheck. That means for many individuals, the biggest problem they will ever get to tackle is how to get food on the table, keep their job, or secure the next check. I believe the scarcity mindset introduced in this difficult lifestyle has led to a lack of political engagement and hyperpartisanship.

It is very possible to feel disgruntled when listening to rich politicians criticize why you aren't caring enough about global issues when your mental bandwidth is arguably occupied with your survival. It is also easier for a politician to convince you to scapegoat, whether it be immigrants, billionaires, or otherwise.

I'm interested in studying this mindset and destroying it, economically or otherwise, to help promote education and free thought across the world. Hopefully, this has the potential to grow the accessibility of political topics across the globe.

## Give Us a Book Recommendation! We'll Share the List with Everyone
Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss

Negotiation is an absolutely essential skill that helps guides almost every interaction in our lives--whenever we are not in agreement (and sometimes, even when we are), we are negotiating. Thus, the potential compounding effects of good negotiation are almost limitless, and Never Split the Difference is perhaps one of the most eloquent and succinct books I've ever read on the topic.
