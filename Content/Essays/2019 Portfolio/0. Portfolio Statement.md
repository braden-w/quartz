# 0. Portfolio Statement
The immigrant's battle to assimilate lasts a few generations, but the war to stay in touch with their roots never ends. Growing up as a fourth-generation Chinese American in a predominantly first-generation community, I have often found myself accustomed to being stuck in "No Man's Land," neither truly accepted or rejected by my peers. This portfolio is an exploration of what it is to lose one's identity, a loved one, but ultimately embrace what it means to be American. It is begins and end on Thanksgiving Dinner, an American tradition which ironically is shared by members of my family who are first, second, third, and fourth generation. During the journey in between, I must come to terms with an important lessonâ€”sometimes, you have to lose yourself to find yourself.
