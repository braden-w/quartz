# [[2022-05-30]] Response to Matt Nieson About Intro Fellowship
Sorry for the delayed response Matt, my pleasure!

I was the first person to take the [[Effective Altruism|YEA]] Summer Virtual Fellowship in their senior year of high school, so I might be a good candidate to speak about this! Also been heavily involved in YEA since my first year and can chat about that, career opportunities, etc. Would highly recommend the fellowship!

If you would like, feel free to book a 1-1 meeting on my Calendly! We can chat about this more in depth.

Heads up, the application is due this Wednesday and it's super short—it’s 3 100-word short responses, and a longer 200-word response due Wednesday! I recommend applying either way—we can decide whether it’s for you. The fellowship is designed to prepare students to maximize their positive impact in the future, and fellows have a weekly 90-minute discussion where they discuss ideas and strategies for improving the world through evidence and reason. Would love to see you there!
