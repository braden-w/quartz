# A Super Unnecessarily Long but Grammatically Correct
[[Reading Responses#^436a55]]

It is incredibly verbose and completely unnecessary to write a single sentence that is up to 250 words long, yet understandable in the context of this class, for the ability to write a sentence of such a length can be a great exercise of one's understanding of the English language should they find it useful to exercise such an understanding; if we were to entertain the usage of the semicolon—a very useful tool if you would like to cheat and unite two independent clauses similar in thought—or the dash—an equally useful tool if you wish to completely interrupt your sentence to add additional information—then we can arrive to the one hundred word mark without too much additional hassle, if the reader is able to withstand such gymnastics; otherwise, we risk having the reader become completely disgusted, throwing their hands up in the air and regarding our writing with utter contempt and disgust, for it is a complete waste of words and an insult to the modern English language to even attempt such a long and unwieldy sentence when modern advancements have only placed further emphasis on concision and velocity of idea transfer; but in the context of Cognitive Science, it is useful for us to see how far we can stretch the limits of languages within its rules, all the while understanding it, for language is an incredible thing to study and understand in our quest to build upon our knowledge of the human mind. ^fc32de

One important takeaway from this exercise is further reinforcing the article's statement that grammar is a discrete combinatorial system in which rules shape our understanding. Since it is a combinatorial system, there are an infinite number of ways to construct meaningful sentences (in the same way, as the article points out, that there are an infinite number of integers). From these initial rules of language, we are able to construct long and meaningful sentences. This is important because it follows the theme that from simple rules or systems can arise very complicated machines (such as building up from Turing machines).
