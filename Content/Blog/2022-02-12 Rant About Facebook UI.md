# 2022-02-12 Rant About Facebook UI
UI is inconsistent and very difficult to navigate. It's hard to put it into words, but the space feels cluttered and too zoomed in (as if it is a mobile device on desktop).

For example, the navigation bar placed at the top of the app layout rather than at the bottom (navigation bar) or side (app drawer) is inconvenient and gets in the way of the search bar and buttons on the top bar.

Secondly, the search bar in the top left corner is expanded on the home page, but collapses to an icon when videos are opened. Right underneath it, there is a search bar with exactly the same style that is not collapsed, which adds to the confusion.
