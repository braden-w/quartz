# Mid-Semester Exec Feedback Form Spring 22

## What's Your Favorite Part of Exec Team? *

## What's the Most Confusing Part of Exec Team? *
The community and inspiration knowing I'm working with highly motivated individuals

## Have You Ever Wondered "But Why Do We Do it Like that?" but Not Asked? Ask Now! Maybe the Answer is "we've Been stupid"
I felt like I had pushed certain ideas for several weeks, and they were dismissed a few times before they were considered (such as centralizing everything into Slack and having weekly EA dinners). I really think we could embrace having a more open mind and willingness to try things once and then quickly go back if they don't work.

I feel like we could make more clearly defined problems that each member in Exec is dedicated to solving. If Eui Young and Thomas are both in charge of managing/helping others, then I feel like we should have a dedicated speaker events role (that is separate from organizing team manager).

## What Do You Wish You Could Change About How Exec Team Functions? *
The entire organizational structure and splitting into subteams. I'm basically running a mini exec team in exec team except that the members are way less dedicated and hard to reach.

## At the Beginning of the Semester, We Asked Everyone to Record Their Time Spent on YEA. Please Write the Breakdown of Stuff Here From Between January 24th and March 18th. *
Unfortunately didn't keep track of categories of events, but I spent the most time on the week of March 07 when I spent 14 hours on EA work, when I spent a disproportionate time doing 1-1's.

## What's the Most Important Thing YEA Should Be Working on Right Now, but Isn't? Is it Less Important Than One of the Things You're Currently Doing? If So, Why Aren't You Working on It? *
Sit down and rethink the entire organizational structure from the ground up. It might be great to do this in the meeting; can give more details!

Other thoughts:
Get a specialized team to lead our speaker events, or don't do them at all. There should be clearer defined roles that people have so they know they are in charge of certain domains, or they won't go out of their way to do it.

Restructuring, forming committees with committee leads, and getting more people involved in the leadership team. I feel like the work I'm doing right now in "organizing team" is somehow in contradiction to exec, since it's like forming a mini team within a team. I feel like a lot of the job of organizing team should be included in the role of exec itself, and organizing team is a team for *helping exec* and not taking on a whole different set of tasks separate from exec.

## Would You Be Interested in Doing Thomas's Current Job Next Semester (with Thomas Doing Something else)? *
Yes, given my current understanding of Thomas's current job

## Alexa
Extremely proactive on IDF and appreciate reading her emails. I especially like how you are up front if you is busy and are unafraid of telling me that you don't have capacity.

## Braden
Struggled a lot in the beginning to really see the meaning of Organizing Team (and still struggling with that to this day). I'm starting to really see how my role is "find people and delegate tasks to them" but I feel like my role is somewhat incongruent compared to what I would like my role to be.

## Eui Young
Really appreciate the one on ones and the care you have invested in my development! I am so grateful for the advisory role you have taken and investment you have put into Teddy so that the younger members in Exec feel supported

## Matt
Locking down socials and I like how openly you embrace getting food to get interest. Also just really enjoy your relaxed vibes—quite a bro. I'm not sure how busy or how much you are in communication with Gian and Sofi—could you elaborate on this at some point with me during the meeting?

## Miriam
Miriam, I really like a lot of your ideas! We come from similar backgrounds and have similar points of view when it comes to leadership, given our experience with other organizations. Super busy all the time, but every time I talk with you I feel inspired

## Teddy
The future of YEA, love you bro <3 Really love the experimentation we have taken this semester with the new semester format and your general vibe and enthusiasm about talking about YEA ideas is super exciting!

## Thomas
You do a lot for YEA, I can't imagine how much time you spend organizing our exec meetings. I enjoy your general assertiveness and how you push for action and moving forward. You sometimes struck me as dismissive of new ideas, which I don't think is intentional but your assertiveness discouraged me from voicing some of the ideas more strongly. I can elaborate during the meeting
