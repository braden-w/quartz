# What is the Philosophical Difference Between [[Taste]] and [[Preference]]?
Is [[Taste]] truly [[Subjective]]? Where does Taste end? What if we extrapolated [[Taste]] to its logical conclusion and commit [[Murder]] if we have a [[Taste]] for it?

## Emotivism
This reminds me of [[Emotivism]], which ironicaly came from a former [[Yale University|Yale]] Professor.

Interestingly, [[Taste]] often comes from [[Elite Class|Elites]], which comes with its own problems.

Instead of trying to validate [[Taste]], what if we just accept that these taste judgements are inevitable?
