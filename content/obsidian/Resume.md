# Resume

# About
I'm an Ethics, Politics, and Computer I'm super into Altruism and doing good.

As a programmer, I'm self-taught and —I may double major in computer science, but . I made a resolution that I would make at least one commit per day on Github, and have been doing my best to keep my numbers up ever since.

Leadershipwise, I"m obsessed with questions on how to enable each person to reach their fullest potential and speak up

## Next Steps

I believe our career intensive will be initialized next year parallel to our intro fellowship (in terms of plannings and timelines), but I will need to double check on that. First-year recruiting will be a priority of mine, with the Extracurricular Bazaar being held in Mid-September.
