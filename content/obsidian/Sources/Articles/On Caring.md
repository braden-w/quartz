# On Caring
- [[Scope Insensitivity]]
	> I'm not very good at _feeling_ the size of large numbers. Once you start tossing around numbers larger than 1000 (or maybe even 100), the numbers just seem "big".
	>
	> Consider Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. If you told me that Sirius is as big as a million earths, I would feel like that's a lot of Earths. If, instead, you told me that you could fit a _billion_ Earths inside Sirius… I would still just feel like that's a lot of Earths.
	>
	> The feelings are almost identical. _In context_, my brain grudgingly admits that a billion is a lot larger than a million, and puts forth a token effort to feel like a billion-Earth-sized star is bigger than a million-Earth-sized star. But out of context — if I wasn't anchored at "a million" when I heard "a billion" — both these numbers just feel vaguely large.
- The incapability of the [[Brain]] to understand [[Scope Insensitivity]]
> Knowing this, I care about every single individual on this planet. The problem is, my brain is _simply incapable_ of taking the amount of caring I feel for a single person and scaling it up by a billion times. I lack the internal capacity to feel that much. My care-o-meter simply doesn't go up that far.
- On courage
	> It's a common trope that courage isn't about being fearless, it's about being afraid but _doing the right thing anyway. In the same sense, caring about the world isn't about having a gut feeling that corresponds to the amount of suffering in the world, it's about _doing the right thing anyway_. Even without the feeling.
- On [[Social Context]]:
	> Consider Alice, a software engineer at Amazon in Seattle. Once a month or so, those college students with show up on street corners with clipboards, looking ever more disillusioned as they struggle to convince people to donate to [Doctors Without Borders](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/). Usually, Alice avoids eye contact and goes about her day, but this month they finally manage to corner her. They explain Doctors Without Borders, and she actually has to admit that it sounds like a pretty good cause. She ends up handing them $20 through a combination of guilt, social pressure, and altruism, and then rushes back to work. (Next month, when they show up again, she avoids eye contact.)
>
> Now consider Bob, who has been given the [Ice Bucket Challenge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Bucket_Challenge) by a friend on facebook. He feels too busy to do the ice bucket challenge, and instead just donates $100 to [ALSA](http://www.alsa.org/).
>
> Now consider Christine, who is in the college sorority ΑΔΠ. ΑΔΠ is engaged in a competition with ΠΒΦ (another sorority) to see who can raise the most money for the National Breast Cancer Foundation in a week. Christine has a competitive spirit and gets engaged in fund-raising, and gives a few hundred dollars herself over the course of the week (especially at times when ΑΔΠ is especially behind).
>
> All three of these people are donating money to charitable organizations… and that's great. But notice that there's something similar in these three stories: these donations are largely motivated by a [[Social Context]]. Alice feels obligation and social pressure. Bob feels social pressure and maybe a bit of camaraderie. Christine feels camaraderie and competitiveness. These are all fine motivations, but notice that these motivations are related to the _social setting_, and only tangentially to the _content_ of the charitable donation.
>
> If you took any of Alice or Bob or Christine and asked them why they aren't donating _all_ of their time and money to these causes that they apparently believe are worthwhile, they'd look at you funny and they'd probably think you were being rude (with good reason!). If you pressed, they might tell you that money is a little tight right now, or that they would donate more if they were a better person.
- Why we fail to care
	> Rather, I'm trying to point at a shift in perspective. Many of us go through life understanding that we _should_ care about people suffering far away from us, but failing to. I think that this attitude is tied, at least in part, to the fact that most of us implicitly trust our internal care-o-meters.
	>
	> The "care feeling" isn't usually strong enough to compel us to frantically save everyone dying. So while we acknowledge that it would be _virtuous_ to do more for the world, we think that we _can't_, because we weren't gifted with that virtuous extra-caring that prominent altruists must have.
- [[Good Altruists Don't Necessarily Care More. Instead, They Learn to act ]]
	> But this is an error — prominent altruists aren't the people who have a larger care-o-meter, they're the people who have _learned not to trust their care-o-meters_.
- [[Our Care-O-Meters Are Broken]]
	> Our care-o-meters are broken. They don't work on large numbers. Nobody has one capable of faithfully representing the scope of the world's problems. But the fact that you can't _feel_ the caring doesn't mean that you can't _do_ the caring.
	> You don't get to feel the appropriate amount of "care", in your body. Sorry — the world's problems are just too large, and your body is not built to respond appropriately to problems of this magnitude. But if you choose to do so, you can still _act_ like the world's problems are as big as they are. You can stop trusting the internal feelings to guide your actions and switch over to manual control.

- [[Good Altruists Don't Necessarily Care More. Instead, They Learn to act]]
	> It's easy to look at especially virtuous people — Gandhi, Mother Theresa, Nelson Mandela — and conclude that they must have cared more than we do. But I don't think that's the case.
- [[Our Feelings Lie to Us]]
	> Nobody gets to comprehend the scope of these problems. The closest we can get is doing the multiplication: finding something we care about, putting a number on it, and multiplying. And then trusting the numbers more than we trust our feelings.
	>
	> Because our feelings lie to us.
	>
	> When you do the multiplication, you realize that addressing global poverty and building a brighter future deserve more resources than currently exist. There is not enough money, time, or effort in the world to do what we need to do.
	>
	> There is only you, and me, and everyone else who is trying anyway.
- [[You Can't Actually Feel the Weight of the World. But Sometimes, You Can Catch a Glimpse]]
	> You can't actually feel the weight of the world. The human mind is not capable of that feat.
	>
	> But sometimes, you can catch a glimpse.
