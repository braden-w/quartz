# The Bitter Lesson
We must realize that AI does not work the same way humans do. Embrace [[Scaling Computation]]. ^0e3733

## The Historical Mistakes That Lead to the Bitter Lesson:
1. AI Researchers try to build knowledge into the AI or a human-centric approach
2. This helps in short turn
3. In long run, plateaus progress
4. Breakthrough project occurs through the **opposite approach** based off scaling computation, searching, and learning
5. The success of 4. leads to a bitter acceptance, because it beats the preferred 1. approach. This is [[The Bitter Lesson]]

## An Example
- [[Computer Vision]]
- Early methods were [[First Principles]]
	- Searching for edges, or generalized cylinders, or in terms of SIFT features.
- But today all this is discarded. Modern methods:
	- Deep-learning [[Neural Network]]s
	- Only the notions of [[Convolution]] and certain kinds of invariances, and perform much better.
Interesting that [[First Principles]] may also fail here.

## Two Lessons:
1. General purpose methods that to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great. The two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning.
2. Actual contents of minds are tremendously, irredeemably complex
	- Stop trying to find simple way to think about content of minds, space, objects, agents, etc.
	- They are intrinsically and endlessly complex
