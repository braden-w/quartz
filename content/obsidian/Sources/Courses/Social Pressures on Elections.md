# Social Pressures on Elections
Shepsle 293-301

Sheppsle discusses a model that relates a citizen's decision to vote to their expected utility and likelihood of making impact on the result of the election. This likelihood is extremely low in large-scale elections, implying that the mathematics of voting suggests that one should not vote. The article goes on to say that in certain communities, refusing to vote might result in higher penalties, such as physical violence, financial consequences, or at the very least a sense of shame. This chapter finishes by arguing that collective action problems should be seen as a competition between competing groups, rather than as a matter of individual voter preferences.

Gerber et al.

This document depicts an experiment aimed at increasing voter turnout in advance of an election. Although it was previously established that many saw voting as a civic obligation, voter turnout was nonetheless low in certain elections. The mailings included themes such as "perform your civic duty" and a warning that their voting status will be visible to their neighbors. It is undeniable that social pressure boosts voter participation. The mailings raised voter turnout by 30-40% in this trial, and at a lower cost per vote than phone banking or canvassing.
