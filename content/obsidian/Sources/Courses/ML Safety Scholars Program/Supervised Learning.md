# Supervised Learning
Learn a function to map $x\to y$. We are given a large dataset
$$D_n = \{(x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}), â€¦, (x^{(n)}, y^{(n)})\}$$

Where x is input and y is output, aka [[Target Value]].

## Types

### Classification
Called [[Binary Classification]] if y can only be one of two values, otherwise called [[Multi-Class Classification]].

### Regression
[[Regression]] is like classification, except that $y$ can be any continuous quantity rather than [[Category]].

See [[Introduction to Machine Learning (MIT)#Linear Regression]]

## Examples
Classification, regression, object detection, semantic segmentation, image captioning, etc.
