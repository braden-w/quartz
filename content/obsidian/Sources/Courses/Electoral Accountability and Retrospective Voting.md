# [[Electoral Accountability]] and [[Retrospective Voting]]

## Chapter 4
The retrospective theory of political accountability states that voters can hold politicians accountable based on whether or not they perceive a politician's policies have benefited their own lives; this theory does not require voters to be policy specialists.  This chapter presents a retrospective voting model in which a voter's "electorally relevant subjective well-being under the incumbent" is determined by the "incumbent's intrinsic competence as well as random events beyond the incumbent's control" (99). The ability of voters to assess the worth of the former is rationally influenced by the amount of information available to them.

Given that people engage in retrospective voting, retrospective voting is also a means of penalizing politicians; all politicians want to engage in policies that "maximize voters' well-being" if they want to be re-elected (100). Other elements, such as partisanship, have an impact on voters' judgments of a politician's success and their personal well-being. Theories of retrospective voting make key assumptions, such as that voters are rational and that people are interested in the outcomes of policies rather than the policies themselves. In other words, if voters believe a politician's policies have resulted in positive outcomes, they will vote for that politician again; if voters believe a politician's policies have resulted in terrible consequences, they will vote against that politician and vote for someone else. 

## Chapter 5
Blind retrospection and voters blaming incumbents for events beyond their control appears unreasonable and irrational. The authors find that the 1916 shark attacks in New Jersey lowered voter support for the incumbent in coastal communities. In this blind retrospection, voters penalize leaders for actions that are technically beyond of their control. The authors examine droughts and floods from 1897 to 2000 and conclude that, after controlling for other factors, incumbents and incumbent parties' vote share declined as a result of these occurrences. They next examine these occurrences in the context of the 2000 presidential election, finding that Democrats received fewer votes than they would have if these events had not occurred.

One possible explanation is that voters "penalize incumbent leaders whenever their personal well-being falls below 'normal levels" on a frequent basis. Retrospection without context can have negative implications, making it difficult to hold politicians and parties accountable for their policies and actions.
