# Five Terrorism Strategies
There are ªve principal strategic logics of costly signaling at work in terror-
ist campaigns: (1) attrition, (2) intimidation, (3) provocation, (4) spoiling, and
(5) outbidding. In an attrition strategy, terrorists seek to persuade the enemy
that the terrorists are strong enough to impose considerable costs if the enemy
continues a particular policy. Terrorists using intimidation try to convince the
population that the terrorists are strong enough to punish disobedience and
that the government is too weak to stop them, so that people behave as the
terrorists wish. A provocation strategy is an attempt to induce the enemy to re-
spond to terrorism with indiscriminate violence, which radicalizes the popula-
tion and moves them to support the terrorists. Spoilers attack in an effort to
persuade the enemy that moderates on the terrorists’ side are weak and un-
trustworthy, thus undermining attempts to reach a peace settlement. Groups
engaged in outbidding use violence to convince the public that the terrorists
have greater resolve to ªght the enemy than rival groups, and therefore are
worthy of support. Understanding these ªve distinct strategic logics is crucial
not only for understanding terrorism but also for designing effective antiterror
policies
