[[Building Blocks of Theory]]

When can Actors Cooperate?

- Actors are more likely to cooperate when they have repeated interactions
- Even if incentive to defect, there is fear of losing future benefits

## Lecture 2 [[2022-01-31]]
[[Realism, Liberalism, and Constructivism]]

[[State]]s are [[Sovereign]], with approximately 200 independent [[State]]s as of now

International system characterized by [[Anarchy]]

### Wasn't There Always a Territorial State System?
In premodern states, tribal and kin-based governance is common---political authority is [[Personalistic Rule]]

[[Personalistic Rule]] is not territorial, leaders command people based on their relationship

Even as states begin to emerge and formal authority structures replace personalistic rule, they adopt associational criteria for membership

But critically, even when rulers and ruled were not personally related, rulers still governed people-e.g. "King of Franks" "King of the English" in Early Middle Ages

### What Are the Origins of the [[Territorial State System]]? How Did We Get There From [[Personalistic Rule]]?
In late Middle Ages, threat of local bandits creates [[Market]] for protection, which expands to dispute resolution and regulation and then [[Governance]], becoming package paid with taxes

```ad-note
title: War Made the Territorial State System
collapse: closed

- "War made states and the state made war" Bellicist Theory of the State--Charles Tilly
- Around the end of the 14th century, military technology changed dramatically
- Massed infantry of archers and pikemen started to displace mounted heavy cavalry
- This undermined the leverage knights/local lords and increased the scale of violence controlled by Kings
- 15th and 16th century military technological changes accelerated these trends
- Artillery and eventually hand-held firearms meant the mounted knight was less important than ever and that large-scale fortifications were more important
- Efficiency of scale gave the advantage to larger political units
- French Revolution, Napoleonic Wars introduced innovations in raising and supplying large armies and in the process raised the scale of war to another level



```

How did War make the emphasis on economies of scale and larger sstates?

### The [[Territorial State System]] in the Middle Ages Snowballed
- Value of governance increases
- Cost of governance decreases
- All factors make it more likely for rulers' markets for [[Governance]] to overlap
- Transition from non-overlapping to overlapping
	- Better economic productivity
	- Better military and administrative technology

```ad-seealso
title: English and Scottish
- In 16th English and Scottish monarchies began to cooperate to assert authority
- Noble lands seized, families like Armstrongs weakened by executions and expropriations
- Border administrative structures merged into the two kingdoms
- Historical record suggests that process was cooperative and motivated by the mutual benefits of eliminating local elites debates about the border were about internal control as well as external relations
```

### Critiques of [[Territorial State System]] Formation
1. The size of the state got smaller, how are they surviving?

![](https://i.imgur.com/ffat5s6.png)
2. Larger states were more likely to die
![](https://i.imgur.com/dr1bFTV.png)

3. There is no relationship between state size and survival

## Lecture 3 [[2022-02-02]]

### Size and Number of States
- Can a World Government arise?
	- I think it could definitely be challenging to do it. I do think that if interplanetary exploration, is a thing, there's a different category to group us with.
- How did number of states decrease from the autonomous independent to larger ones?
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/iqK9Fkz.png)
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/0soJ258.png)
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/p9Abrp2.png)
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/CC5CnZX.png)
- Why is the Number of States Increasing? Why will people vote for more states than is efficient?`
	- Democratization leads to secessions and more countries (cares for individual preferences compared to an auth)
	- Number of countries is increasing in amount of economic integration and globalization
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ka85miX.png)
- Origins of the Territorial State System in Early Modern Europe?
	1. War, [[Bellicist theory]]
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/faZ9gHC.png)
	1. Cartels
		- ![](https://i.imgur.com/OTe620w.png)
	- Primary source is [[Colonialism]]

```ad-question
title: Borders constitute stable demarcations of?
collapse:closed
Sharp Changes in political authority.
```

### Example 1: China
- How was China different from other countries?
	- They were large, demanded to be recognized for their sovereignty.
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/kfBlnPa.png)

### Example 2: Congo
- What was Leopold II's dissatisfaction?
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/vfpzBcg.png)
- What did Leopold do?
	- He travelled around the world obsessed and studying other countries
- He wanted a taste for?
	- "Exploiting the world"
- What did he do after he identified the Congo as a target?
	- He acquires land from local chiefs through treaties, under the cloak of scientific and humanitarian organizations
- How is he able to gain power?
	- 1884 Berlin Conference
- Role of race?
	- He wasn't motivated by this specific race, it's more about power. Would rule above any race if he could
	- But it's impossible to imagine this being possible without race
	- There is a racial element in all of them

```ad-note
European powers used force to coerce China into following norms of [[Territorial State System]] while they themselves selectively ignored the norms by violating China's sovereignty.

See the [[Opium Wars]]

```

	- Advantage the negotiator as much.
	- You must think of both what is good for country and constituency
- How do smaller and larger win-sets work?
	- Smaller win-sets advantage Level 1 negotiator

- What is Finnemore and Sikkink known for?
- Norms explain behavior

1. "Norm emergence." Norm entrepreneurs arise (randomly) with a conviction that something must be changed. These norms use existing organizations and norms as a platform from which to proselytize (e.g. UN declarations), framing their issue to reach a broader audience. In Stage 1, then, states adopt norms for domestic political reasons. If enough states adopt the new norm, a "tipping point" is reached, and we move to stage 2.
2. "Norm cascade." In stage 2, states adopt norms in response to international pressure--even if there is no domestic coalition pressing for adoption of the norm. They do this to enhance domestic legitimacy [comment: seems to imply domestic demand], conformity [b/c leaders don't want to stick out], and esteem needs [because being shamed as non-conformists by the int'l community makes them feel bad]. We need more psychological research to consider how this works [apparently].
3. "Norm internalization." Over time, we internalize these norms. Professionals press for codification and universal adherance. Eventually, conformity becomes so natural that we cease to even notice the presence of a norm.

[[Democratic Peace Theory]]
- What is [[Reverse Causation]]?

## Communities

[[Jus Ad Bellum Vs. Jus In Bello]]
Beth Simmons argues that human rights treaties are likely to be most effective at improving human rights practices in countries in transition. on. "In stable autocracies" she writes, "citizens have the motive to mobilize but not the means. In stable democracies, they have the means but generally lack the motive/'

[[International Criminal Court (ICC)]]

Obligation means that states are legally bound by rules or commitments and therefore subject to the general rules and procedures of international law.
Precision means that the rules are definite, unambiguously defining the conduct they require, authorize, or proscribe.
Delegation grants authority to third parties for the implementation of rules, including their interpretation and application, dispute settlement, and (possibly) further rule making.
