# ECON 121

## Lecture 1
In models, economic [[Agent]]s pursue well-defined goals, optimizing under restrictions

1. [[Unconstrained Optimization]]
	- First-order conditions
	- Second-order conditions
2. [[Constrained Optimization]]
	- Substitution method
	- Lagrange method

- [[Constrained Optimization]] vs. [[Unconstrained Optimization]]
	- Constrained has a "such that $f(x,y)=0$" condition

## Single-variable [[Optimization]], No Constraint
[[First-Order Condition]] is the first derivative

[[Second-Order Condition]] is the second derivative

When [[First-Order Condition]] and [[Second-Order Condition]] are both 0, you must investigate further

Hessian Matrix

  $$\begin{bmatrix}
	u_{11} & u_{12} \\
	u_{21} & u_{22}
  \end{bmatrix}$$
