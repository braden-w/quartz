# Empathic Accuracy is a Construct
![](https://i.imgur.com/4q4SZvO.png)

When told the study is **about emotion and empathy**, women outperform men on empathic accuracy

An example of the [[stereotype effect]] where people fall in line with their role

But when told they are **paid per accuracy of perceiving others' thoughts and feelings**,  men and women had no difference in performance.

```ad-note

Similarly, gender difference disappears if men are told empathetic accuracy increases their romantic appeal
