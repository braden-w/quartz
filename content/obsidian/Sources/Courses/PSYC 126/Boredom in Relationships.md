# Boredom in Relationships
- Excitement wains
- Low positive and low negative

Back to [[Self-expansion Theory]], we must seek sources of expansion in close relationships:

1. Directly and rapidly gaining new resources, perspectives, and identities
2. Share exciting, novel experiences

Keep the excitement alive
