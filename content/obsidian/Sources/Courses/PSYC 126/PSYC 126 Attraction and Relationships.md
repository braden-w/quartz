# PSYC 126 Attraction and Relationships
[[Process This Please]]

# Lecture 13: Relationships and Broader Social Context
[[WEIRD - Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Demographic]]

[[Marriage]]

[[Gender Constructs]]

[[Socioeconomic StatusSES and Relationships]]

# Lecture 14: Stresses and Strains
```ad-summary
All types of support benefit us. The best support fits our needs and our preferences.
```

```ad-summary
What ultimately matters is what we *think* our partners do for us and how that compares to what we think they *should* do for us.

```

Marital quality often declines after the birth of a couple's first child

# Transition to Parenthood

## Stress Affects Behavior
[[After the Birth, Perceived Unfairness Linked with More Distress and Conflict, But the Unfairness Was Always There]]

[[Stressor]]

[[Stress Felt Affected the Explanations for Imagined Insensitive Behavior]]

## People Respond Differently Based on Challenge
[[Marriage, Birth, and Divorce Rates 8 Years After Hurricane Hugo All Increased Compared to 14 Years After]]

[[Greater Stress Linked to Worse Relationship Quality, but High Perceived Partner Responsiveness Buffers This Effect (COVID-19)]]

# Long Distance Relationships
[[Committed vs. less committed long distance ]]

Physical distance is a [[Stressor]], linked with attachment threat, relationship uncertainty, and psychological distress

# Interpersonal Conflict
[[Interpersonal Conflict]]

Unhappy partners engage in:

- [[Kitchen-Sinking]]
- [[Drift off-beam]]
- Jumping to conclusion on what their partners need, rather than making they understand
- [[Mind Reading]]

 Relationship and Self Growth

# Negative Behaviors
1. Criticism: attacks a partner's personality or character instead of identifying a specific behavior
2. Contempt: insults, mockery
3. Defensiveness: protect self with excuses
4. Stonewalling: clam up and withdraw

# Can We Actually Predict Divorce with 80%+ Accuracy?
Critics claim these prediction studies overestimate how diagnostic these are of actual behavior

But these are genuine patterns of negative behaviors

# Features of Good Conflict Discussion
1. Paraphrase what your partner says, make sure you are checking that what you here is accurate with the expresser
2. Perception checking—opposite of [[Mind Reading]]
3. Validation—acknowledge legitimacy of feelings

# Conclusions of Conflict Discussion
1. Separation
2. 1. Domination
3. Compromise
4. Integrative agreements
5. Structural improvement

# Hurt and Pain
[[People suffering from romantic rejection looked at pictures of ex-lover and felt physical pain]]

# Relational Selves
We are not the same person all the time (and that is okay)

Other people remind us and bring out the versions we should become

[[Merely Exposing (even subconsciously) People to a Relationship Partner Leads Them to Act in Ways Consistent with Goals Associated with That Partner]]

[[Self-overlap with Others and the Inclusion of Others (IOS) Scale]]

[[Greater confusion between close others and ourselves than non-close others and ourselves]]

[[People have a implicit positive preference for letters in the alphabet from their own name (and their partner's name)]]

[[When your sense of self is clear, you are better able to create an overlap between self and other, leading to better relationship]]

[[Self-expansion Theory]]

# [[Boredom in Relationships]]
 Lecture 16: Relationship and Self Growth Continued

Why sharing novel activities work to alleviate [[Boredom in Relationships]]:

1. [[Misattribution of Arousal]]
2. Cooperation enhances interdependence
3. Creates impression that relationship is exciting

[[Novelty Doesn't Have to Be Physically Arousing, Just Self-expanding]]

[[The more bored people felt at year 7 of marriage, the less satisfied they were in year 16. (Tsapelas et al., 2009)]]

[[Self-authenticity is Best Felt When Interacting with Close Others (Venaglia & Lemay, 2017)]]

We [[Self-expansion Theory|Self-expand]] through our partner

[[Supportive Relationships Boost Self-Confidence]]

[[The Michelangelo Effect]]

[[The More Affirming the Partner, the More Likely Partner is to Achieve Their Goals]]

The more partners possess [[Ideal Similarity]], the more [[Partner Affirmation]] occurs, which then allows partners to close to their [[Ideal Self]], and increase well being

 Lecture 17: Dissolution

[[Suffocation Model]]

# Shift of Expectations
[[Rather than rely on our partners for survival, we shift our expectation for higher self-actualization needs]]

We are expecting more out of our messaages but also investing less (c.f. Amato et al., 2009)

In general, average marriage is now less satisfying (and therefore more divorce)

BUT the good marriages are *great*

Positive link between well-being and marital quality is getting stronger over time (c.f. Proulx et al, 2007)

# Shifting Westorn Culture of Divorce
Perceptions of divorce are less negative than in past

Viewed as more reasonable and desirable response (Amato & Rogers, 1999)

Leads to us putting less work into divorce (Whitton et al., 2013)

# Cohabitation
Couples do not all have the same goals when doing so

Why do people who cohabit seem to separate more quickly

# 6 Dimensions of Pre-marital Break up and What Causes Them

What predicts degree of emotional distress after break-up

You are losing all of the benefits we have discussed we've spent the whole course on how to get

# Consciously Uncoupling
![](https://i.imgur.com/fPlYO4v.png)

No empirical research, but from theoretical standpoint, might represent a slower and more structured process of reducing interdependence

# Difficulty in Ending Relationships
Most people are simultaneously torn between both options

# Friendships Over Time

## Friendships in Adolescence Shift From Acceptance to Intimacy
![](https://i.imgur.com/x2yL555.png)

## We Spend More Time with Friends but with Less People
![](https://i.imgur.com/QqaQqGJ.png)

## We Start to Withdraw Number of Friends with Age and Romantic Relationships
![](https://i.imgur.com/5t0td1B.png)

## Socioemotional Selectivy Theory
Changes in inpersonal goals are driving changes in social networks

As time perspective shrinks, we put greater emphasis on meaningful interactions instead of wide net of connections

On average, older adults are happy with their relationships (often happier than younger adults)

# Friendships Are Voluntary

# Adjustment to Breakup

# Affective Forecasting: People Are Incorrectly Predicting Distress They Will Feel
![](https://i.imgur.com/lSonZQ6.png)

## Why We Are Wrong with Our Forecasting
![](https://i.imgur.com/iDrCfCr.png)

## We Can Accurately Predict They Will Feel Better Over Time, but We Overestimate the Initial Pain of Break up
We Usually Are Off Only by Initial Intensity of Pain (it's Not as Bad as We think)

## We Actually *Can* Still Be Friends
![](https://i.imgur.com/IRMf0cU.png)

# Talking to an Ex
![](https://i.imgur.com/UKa48Ai.png)

- About half of undergraduates in study talk to their ex
- Talking to an ex doesn't mean you had a better or worse relationship

# Rebound Relationships
They actually *can* serve some purposes: boost confidence, self-expand, fill gap left by former partner

Higher levels of self-compassion at the initial visit were linked with lower divorce-related distress up in 9 months

In summary, be kind to yourself

# [[Socioeconomic StatusSES and Relationships|SES]] Leads Us to Underestimate Commitment of Partner in Relationship
Even though this is not the case, and low and high SES have no difference in actual commitment (this is instead related to perceived commitment).

How this leads to Self-Protection

Low SES is

```

There is more than one way to fulfill need to belong (Hirsch & Clark 2018)

[[Symbolic Social Bonds]]

 Lecture 22: Relationships and Health

[[Greater Social Integration Was Linked to a Decreased Mortality Risk]]

[[Meta-analysis]] of other studies led to conclusion: [[Those with strong social integration had a 50% increased likelihood of survival]]

[[Those with Social Isolation Had 30% Increased Risk of Early Mortality]]

```ad-conclusion
The presence of social integration is linked to better physical well-being

The absence of social integration is linked to worse physical well-being
```

[[Poor social ties linked to progression of disease, wounds heal faster when others accept and support us]]
