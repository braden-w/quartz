# Rhesus Monkey Experiment
by: [[Harry Harlow]]

## Procedure
- Rhesus monkeys raised in social isolation and reared on two mothers - wire mother → is not cozy - cloth mother → is cozy
  Previous assumption → love is about survival

## Results
- Infants reared with monkey mothers → Peers played and socialized typically
- Infants reared with only cloth wire→Slower but caught up
- Infants reared only wire → No caught up

## Conclusion
Emphasizes the importance of contact comfort

- Given a choice between a wire mother that dispensed milk and a milk-free cloth mother, baby monkeys overwhelmingly preferred the cloth mothers.
- He found that monkeys living with their mothers thrived physically, while those deprived of maternal succor withered away and often died, like untouched children in orphanages
- Harlow demolished behaviorism's claim that infant attachment depends on food.

An extreme position, made popular by psychologists like [[John Watson]], held that young children should never be caressed, held or physically comforted by parents
