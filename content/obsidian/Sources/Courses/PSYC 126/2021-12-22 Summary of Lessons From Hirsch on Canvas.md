# [[2021-12-22]] Summary of Lessons From Hirsch on Canvas
Remember our lessons learned (I've compiled what was discussed):

- support comes in all different packages: e.g. affectionate touch, invisible support. Remember to balance needs with preferences

- capitalize: share good events with others and be an active constructive sharer of others' joy

- self-expand: keep looking for new experiences and awesome people to share them with

- gratitude: tell the people you love that you love them

- don't avoid conflict -- engage in it effectively ("I-statements", avoid mindreading, practice active listening, etc.)

- remember that relationships don't occur in a vacuum: culture, society, individual differences (like attachment styles) and social context can all spillover into your relationships with others. Your relationships, in turn, spill over into your physical health. Be mindful of this when interacting with others

And a few more that are my own additions:

- be vulnerable: expressing emotions and vulnerabilities can increase intimacy, but it is OK to balance this with self-protection when needed

- therapy: being willing to go before there are problems equips you with the tools needed when you _do_ encounter problems. Being willing to go when something comes up for which you need help allows you to _get_ that help. And just like any other relationship, it is important to find the right "fit" with a therapist -- I wouldn't want a not-so-great experience with one therapist to push you away from the idea of therapy in general

- remember it is OK to be self-focused sometimes. Take care of yourself and your needs when you need to.
