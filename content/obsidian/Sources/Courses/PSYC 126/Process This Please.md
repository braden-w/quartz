## [[Mary Ainsworth's Strange Situation]]

## Types of Attachment of Babies to Caregivers
Learned from [Mary Ainsworth's Strange Situation]

[[Secure (60%)]]
[[Avoidant (20%)]]
[[Anxious or Ambivalent (15%)]]
[[Disorganized (5%)]]

- Attachment styles according to Cindy Hazan & Phil Shaver (1987)
	- Secure: I find it relatively easy to get close to others and am comfortable depending on them and having them depend on me. I don’t often worry about being abandoned or about someone getting too close to me.
	- Anxious/Ambivalent: I find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I often worry that my partner doesn’t really love me or won’t want to stay with me. I want to merge completely with another person, and this desire sometimes scares people away.
	- Avoidant: I am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others; I find it difficult to trust them completely, difficult to allow myself to depend on them. I am nervous when anyone gets too close and, often, love partners want me to be more intimate than I feel comfortable being.

## Sources of Attachment of Babies to Caregivers
Learned from [[Mary Ainsworth's Strange Situation]]

### Parents of Babies with [[Secure (60%)]] → Especially Sensitive to Chid's Emotional State, Detecting "request" for Reassurance, Especially Responsive and Take Care

### Parents of Babies with [[Avoidant (20%)]] → Not Good at Addressing Needs

### Parents of [[Ambivalent (15%)]]→ Previous Inconsistent Behavior. Baby Cannot Be Certain That They Will Be Available

Readings

Attachment Styles

The Four Attachment Styles ↓

Secure → Confident

Preoccupied → In your head

Dismissing → Don't need anyone

Fearful → Insecure

![](local:///Users/braden/remnote/Braden_W/files/Siet1ELPg5Uhxw8KUIkt_MhK3TlzKxGYEZK93pKOkHgGjzEDiY1kJjJe4xQNtaJVBDxmDsc2VVjWsUQLdmuHUej6FBz4kNMPBjat6tXdA34467jJSsCMjh3nECLdpTDt.png)

[Fearful] are dismissive because of fear of rejection
[Dismissing] are dismissive because not thinking it's worth it, feel self sufficient

Two broad themes about styles ↓

Avoidance of intimacy → Ease and trust which we accept intimacy with others

Anxiety about abandonment → Dread that others will find us unworthy and leave

[Secure] people take great comfort in closeness with others and do not worry that others will mistreat them; as a result, they gladly seek intimate interdependency with others.

In contrast, with all three of the other styles ([Preoccupied] , [Fearful] , [Dismissing] ), people are burdened with anxiety or discomfort that leaves them less at ease in close relationships. Preoccupied people want closeness but anxiously fear rejection. Dismissing people don’t worry about rejection but don’t like closeness.

Influence of parenting on children

The levels of acceptance or rejection we receive from our parents are huge influences early on (Bernier etal., 2014). Expectant mothers who are glad to be pregnant are more likely to havesecure toddlers a year later than are mothers-to-be who are hesitant and uncertain

Experimentation

Self-reports → The most common form of getting data, often through questionnaires and interviews and diaries

The most common means of studying intimate relationships is to ask people about their experiences through [Self-reports]

Difficulties of [Self-reports] ↓

Memory/forgetting stuff

Social desirability bias → Distortion of results from people's desire to make good impressions on others

Difficulties of Interpreting results ↓

Paired, interdependent data → Happiness of one partner of relationship is probably dependent of happiness of other

Three sources of influence → Relationships emerge from the individual contributions of the separate partners and from the unique effects of how theycombine as a pair

Meta-analyses → Combine findings of multiple previous experiments

Scientific method

Theory

Falsifiable hypothesis

Reshape theory based on data

Collecting Data

Non-experimental methods ↓

Naturalistic Observation → unobtrusive observe in natural habitat

Surveys → Answer questions voluntarily

Research Observations → Create a situation to observe people's reaction (similar to [Naturalistic Observation] ), often combined with [Surveys]

Experimental method → Change a variable with all others equal to determine it's causal pour

Individuals and [Dyadic data]

Lots of research focus on data from individuals to understand relationship processes (which is OK!)

However, close relationships contain at least **two** people, and has[Paired, interdependent data]

This is why we have [Dyadic data]

Dyadic data

complications ↓

More complicated logistics

More complex statistics

Greater risk

but it's worth it → consider the Jubilee video with the guy talking about postmodernism vs. the woman who just said "he's my boyfriend"

Ethics of science ↓

Informed consent

Don't coerce

Protect from harm

Provide risk-benefit analysis

Minimal deception

[[Lecture 11 - Sex - students.pptx]]

example of passable deception → Telling someone that they will be giving a speech, but then they don't have to. Just observing what leads up to it (nerves, etc.), not the behavior itself

Adult [Attachment Styles] are a person's **mental model** of others

[Secure] ↓

Thinks people can be trusted

Feels a lot

Behaves by being close

[Avoidant (20%)] ↓

Think people can't be trusted

Feel not much anything when with others

Behave by keeping distant

[Anxious/Ambivalent (15%)] #[[Anxious/Ambivalent (15%)]] ↓

Think person doesn't like them as much as they like the person

Feel afraid of relationships but wants them desperately

Behave by constantly seeking approval and reassurance from close others

Note: [Attachment Styles] describe intimacy, not openness to social

As children develop, they shift their [Attachment Styles] from caregivers to peers

Self-fulfilling prophecy → Our beliefs —influence→ our actions —impact→ other's belief's —influence→ other's actions —reinforce → our beliefs

Can attachment styles change?

Adult attachment can be challenging to modify

Socialization-selection asymmetries ↓

Adults are more stable than adolescant

Socially dominant early in life can shape our attachment system

High self esteem ↓

Trust in another's care → perceive that support and acceptance is available → drop self protection → seek support when needed, provide support when needed, or engage in mutually enjoyable activities

Safety to drop self-protection

Low self esteem ↓

Low trust in another's care → perceive support isn't available → chronically self-protective → unable to seek support when needed, provide support when needed, or engage in mutually enjoyable activities

Implicit theories of relationships ↓

Destiny → emphasis on whether relationship is meant to be (soulmates). Disengage when gets tough

Growth → Emphasis on building and growing relationship; focus on maintaining the relationship because of (not in spite of) obstacles

Two by two quadrant → Believe relationships can be diagnosable, or believe problems can be fixed

Lecture 3 [September 21st, 2021] Attraction

Building Blocks of Relationships

Attachment

Attraction → The desire to approach someone

This is primarily the {{ desire }} to approach someone

Types of reasons/rewards

direct → We feel validated or direct gratification

indirect → They remind us of ourselves

Physical attraction

The average face

What is beautiful will be defined by what emerges from the composite of many faces

[The average face] is {{more attractive}} than all the other faces it is the average of

why is [The average face] attractive?→It implies health and symmetry

It's not that "average" as in "plain" is attractive, but that the closer you are to the composite, the more attractive you are

Women may particularly find men with rugged/masculine facial features during fertility/ovulation, but otherwise like the [The average face] for the remainder of the time

[[Waist-to-hip Ratio]]

**Bias for beauty**→Physical attractive people are rated as in more
{{self-fulfilling}} prophecy (possible explanation) | we treat beautiful people better than others and this elicits "goodness"

Men's judgement of women study

process | men were shown a {{picture}} of an attractive or unattractive women before having a phone call with a random woman. Body language coders also observed the women's responses. There were positive responses from both men and women, even though the women didn't know {{which way they were assigned}}

People tend to match with people who are of similar levels of {{physical attractivenes}}s

- Physical proximity | We like people who are {{nearby}}
  ![](local:///Users/braden/remnote/Braden_W/files/iYcp8f43wRZbO8cshrOP-z3hhBED4Q3H6a9c1rUuNLNPvajiWX05bVwepxevkh2T-lhRueqmdcKU6mJDqNw9GEkJdEoL2p55RDmEwqwBsxY55vigsdBhgOuja9vPjt6z.png)
  Online dating is a digital enhancement of [Physical proximity | We like people who are nearby]

1. Familiarity | We like people who we see {{often}}, called the [Mere Exposure Effect] ↓
	Mere Exposure Effect
1. Similarity | We like those who we think {{are like}} us
	Any kind of increases in {{**perceived**}}{{similarity}} leads to increased liking
1. Reciprocity | We like those who {{like}} us ↓
	Why do we like people who like us? It's low risk—the fear of rejection is removed

Lecture 4-5 [September 21st, 2021] Attraction and Relationship initiation

Three types of data Relationship scientists use to predict relationship outcomes ↓ - Data on individuals (traits, values, preferences) 1. Data on dyads (satisfaction, conflict behavior) 1. Data on situations (stress, alternatives)

Do online dating algorithms work? No, because they only give [Data on individuals (traits, values, preferences)] , which is only one of the [Three types of data Relationship scientists use to predict relationship outcomes]

Questionaires like dating apps helped predict {{attraction}}, but could not predict {{matches}} ([Attraction] vs. [Matching : Beyond Attraction] )

Misattribution of arousal

Example study | Hanging over a ledge and [Misattribution of arousal] to researcher instead of hanging

Example study 2 | Label dating desirability of a person a photo either {{ before }} or {{ after }} a ride of roller coaster![](local:///Users/braden/remnote/Braden_W/files/lITYT07-KGTBAPionEGXPdshOVfGoIhfIjxqr6aorwKLBvBMiHSaCUXFzeUI4F8caD_1X5kyMgm6y7efXkF6SCNxsjeZC7bbQs5rF1o2z20b_Q0jhiK93M2FO-nEPAfa.png)

Relationship → Any state where the actions and thoughts of one person influences the other ![](local:///Users/braden/remnote/Braden_W/files/uhO-qg0xok0Ljt0-3LAUTeM3zETr21bAeLIw2s6loRuwN-jKlRax4kXeQ2P9C9cFOsrIAjqIhgqrJz3XZn0SFi1ATtYgutL-TaqxHi71G-T1aUzscm_lv6plCA2N9m8R.png)

For some relationships, little initiation is required. For example, consider your {{ parents }} or your boss.

For friends and romantic relationships, some type initiation is required.

How do we shift from [Attraction] to a relationship?

Cost/benefit analysis → Weighing the costs and benefits

Interdependence theory → Focus is on maximizing benefits and minimizing costs. People become close because the rewards of these interactions outweigh the costs (a meal, a ride, intimacy, support)

very economic

uses→[Cost/benefit analysis]

Our [Cost/benefit analysis] in interdependence is influenced by {{ comparison level }} and {{ comparison level for alternatives }}([Comparison level] and [Comparison level for alternatives] )

advantages→![](local:///Users/braden/remnote/Braden_W/files/h6nao1Dx8EE46xx3BXeEUgq-MMPYhbDWICBI1NaCM2upJsc-oRbtwT7iVVJuvj0oP_5qCrdzYXvSnAIU8dOkDjwfYoKgbNxC3He5_59-dF874xF0pRZbm_jbmDXqJlIq.png)

Comparison levels (aka standards)

Comparison level → What we expect from our relationship. Often based off past experiences and are our "standards"

Comparison level for alternatives → What we expect from a potential different relationship. Often based off past experiences and are our "standards"

closeness as responsiveness → Feeling of security and using a partner as a secure base

Lecture 6 [September 21st, 2021] Communal and Exchange Relationships

Exchange relationships → No special responsibility for welfare, benefits are given based on past benefits or future expected benefits

Communal relationships → Assume special responsibility, non-contingent

What's necessary to get a communcal relationship ↓ - Participants are available and interested 1. Participant find other person attractive 1. Other person find participant attractive

Example Studies (Ancient History)

The wife of a grad student among first years, asks for help

Variables manipulated ↓

- [Participants are available and interested] by saying "I'm open to meeting new people" or "I'm married sorry" 1. Repaying | Pays people who help her with extra credit or not
  dependent variable → How much did they like the confederate, depending on if she offers to repay or not
  ![](local:///Users/braden/remnote/Braden_W/files/wcIWjJ9-L-srW-0JdzZRp6Iv0pTImQbiK19zs2M7TEWHzUYdPztVN4UBqIqKW-lxVd01wjqibES3rcz57tBZrBLWqiHnMwDXxJ8YibPQtrV-SJIPHRQ3HZW8nXl_0MjG.png) Confederate was liked more when exchange (married) and offers trepays, and liked more when communal (open) and doesn't repay)
  Conclusion → People like to keep track of who does what in [Exchange relationships] but not [Communal relationships]
  A person flashes a light for help, measured how many people turn around to look
  ![](local:///Users/braden/remnote/Braden_W/files/5XqDjVbe8c-lJF67pkBCeQ8YSTC7_wZG8usM4dquQVvgsi5G3o_6LIJ6HKUaeiZIjTAH0RA76fK6W2HGMknVK9cHMMRbB90Op_IW1Xuh3hhOb_vxWt8Gr4mWMSsVBumo.png) results | people turned more in expectation of [Exchange relationships]

  2021 Study | Giant questionnaire survey across the population
  findings among population → they believe[Communal relationships] should be applied to serious relationships, parent child relationships, etc.
  Polls from class, the majority answers of the class are below
  Distribution of [Communal relationships] with friends?→We invest equally
  Distribution of [Communal relationships] with mother?→Mother invests way more than we do back
  Are exchange relationships more selfish than communal ones?→Yes
  Which relationships are more likely to be long term?→Communal
  Communal hierarchy → Priority of our relationships and willingness to sacrific, from highest strength to lowest strength
  Everyone has a implicit [Communal hierarchy]
  ![](local:///Users/braden/remnote/Braden_W/files/EAxDXkM8Ee8FUk3xrTBe8uBFlRnfhPy-gZplo1gU76wVLFrtTM3npBTwyFXbWcMbjPtrCKGXtxFklkySxufK4Qwh8YTQv8uTWFOcOJbvn63U8-e-rrQaHK_v2a2pLj4F.png) ![](local:///Users/braden/remnote/Braden_W/files/WrFZIeRxaHW-TNqkIUkQFcGx-YwB2Pzv8-UmtuRGcY_WpoZVKMVlmb92rzS-M3PGVci_AZT15rbt4yTjTolhgaBZfJL1lRgKoJjDEiDjyYNIXoN2TkyTQ2tYn5zohUnj.png)
  It's possible to have [Communal relationships] with people you don't know, such as {{charity and those in need }}
  Think about [Distribution of Communal relationships with mother?]
  Assymetrical vs. symmetrical [Communal relationships]
  Are [Communal relationships] meant to be long term and [Exchange relationships] short term? No because ↓ - The lack of record keeping argues against that 1. Keeping track is impossible and biased 1. People engage in charity 1. Most parents do not want children to pay back loans 1. Turn taking occurs but is completely compatible with communal norms
  Are [Communal relationships] unselfish and [Exchange relationships] are selfish? We must ask what was the {{motivation}} to adopt the norm {{in the first place}}? It is a case by case basis.
  ![](local:///Users/braden/remnote/Braden_W/files/ajuJH5lwJVP000FLSkw19ZH3PuX-C3Z0iPMfeNB4OjeuZ4tXPV-ktDfsWQBA5TVaiQHuws-2NDEE_TsDZqdMr2ITXoTBlO12Ube9C_tEpxy04PTho-jXhXGXAhtxDn9S.png)
  It's toxic to place yourself at the top of the [Communal hierarchy]
  Lecture 7 [September 23rd, 2021]
  Not all relationships have high responsiveness
  reasons ↓ - Partners aren't supportive; they argue 1. Partners don't reveal vulnerabilities; they withdraw 1. They over-react to the smallest sign of rejection 1. They fear intimacy

  assumptions ↓ - People know what a "good" relationship should look like 1. Reasonably anxious and self-protective 1. Reasonably self-focused and selfish 1. People are motivated to strive to look like a "good" relationship partner at the start
  steps
  You start by evaluating if they are trustworthy and worthy of a relationship, whether or not you are interested
  Studies on sharing
  Study 1 | Giving people boring or fun tasks, and then allow them to request or offer to trade fun or boring tasks

  Basic Emotions Theory (BET) → Certain emotions are hardwired in human condition and are universally recognizeable

      Constructivism → Emotions are built based on the current [context]

      Emotions and vulnerability
          Expressing emotions is an act of vulnerability with [benefits]  and [risks]
          benefits → Strengthen relationships, open door to getting support
          risks → ignored, taken advantage, responded to negatively
          We are more likely to express emotions to people with higher [Communal relationships]  strength
          We actually do express more emotion to partners whom we perceive as {{ responsive }}
      Communcal partners have your back ↓
          - Influences your appraisal of a situation, and therefore, the emotion you experience
          1. Allows you to drop self-protection and focus outward on your environment
          1. It is safe to express your emotion, which in turn influences your emotions
          1. Some emotion regulation needs can be offloaded to your partners
              Dyadic emotion regulation
                  We often individually engage in emotion regulation
                  You don't expect a stranger to make you feel less sad, but you do go to a close partner with the hope that they cheer you up

  Types of social support in [Communal relationships] ↓ - Social Support 1. Physical Comfort 1. Emotional Support 1. Advice Support 1. Material Support
  All [Types of social support in Communal relationships] leads to increased satisfaction of relationship
  The presence (or absence) of social support in a relationship can serve as a signal of relationship health
  Happily married couples provide more support to one another than distressed ones
  High levels of support exchanges as newlyweds linked to lower likelihood of divorce 10 years later
  Attachment and social support
  [Secure (60%)] → Most often provide effective support for compassionate reasons
  [avoidant (20%)] → Provide less support than [Secure (60%)] #[[Avoidant (20%)]][anxious/ambivalent (15%)] → Provide support that is intrusive and controlling #[[Anxious/Ambivalent (15%)]]
  The best support matches our needs and preferences
  The support provided should match the support desired
  Law students preparing for the bar exam
  [Material Support] (like partner helping with dinner) was {{ Helpful }}
  [Emotional Support] actually increased {{ anxiety }}
  Elderly people with impaired vision
  [Material Support] led them to feel {{ helpless }}
  [Emotional Support] was actually {{ welcomed }}
  Invisible support → The best kind of support is the kind that isn't recognized by the target as support
  On 61% of days partners agreed about the presence or absence of support exchanges
  When examinees perceived receiving support, they felt more anxious the next day
  BUT when examinees didn't perceive receiving support but their partner reported providing support, they were the least anxious
  Emotional support that doesn't strike the target as emotional support is the best kind
  Culture and Social Support
  Individualistic cultures view the self as independent and ask for support more {{easily}}
  Collectivist cultures view the self as {{ interdependent }} and resist asking for support for fear of being a {{ burden or relationship consequences}}
  What ultimately matters is what we {{ __think__ }} our partners do for us.
  Individual supportive acts are the foundation of our general perceptions of support availability, whether we realize it or not

  Responsiveness
  three components ↓ - Understanding (asking questions) 1. Validating (validating emotions) 1. Caring (support)
  Capitalization → the sharing of a beneficial or positive event with others and deriving additional benefit from this sharing
  example → me telling Carrie about my day

  154 undergraduates completed 7 day daily diary study
  positive event importance correlated with positive affect (.07) and life satisfaction (.17)
  [Capitalization] correlated with positive affect (.20) and life satisfaction (.23)

Lecture 10 [October 5th, 2021]

Sacrifice → forgoing own preference by doing something you find unpleasant that you don't wnat to do or giving up something pleasant that you would like to do

Can serve as important signal of relationship commitment and dedication

Opportunity for recipient to feel grateful

But how accurate are we at detecting [Sacrifice]s?

126 romantic dyads in the Netherlands
8-day daily diary study with a 1 year follow up

Findings

When a sacrifice was reported, the recipient was 50% likely to notice

When a sacrifice was perceived, it was only actually a sacrifice 50% of the time

Participants experienced {{ more gratitude }} on days they {{ perceived a sacrifice }} (regardless of whether one actually occurred)

No change in felt gratitude when missed sacrifice

When a sacrifice actually occurred, if perceiver detected it, they felt {{greater relationship satisfaction}}

Reconstructive memory

Recall of prior ratings were based on present ratings

If satisfaction {{increased}} over past two months, past ratings were remembered as {{more positive}} than they really were

If satisfaction {{decreased}} over past two months, past ratings were remembered as {{more negative}} than they really were

This is an example of memory bias

We use the present as a lens that affects our view of the past

Memory bias

Content romantic couples report that things are better than ever

But they always say this, and in reality their satisfaction is usually gradually eroding

Positive Illusions - Improved image of the partner in your mind → We see the partner as better than others seem them

Improved Partner

How I rate partner = how I rate the ideal partner

This means that I rate my partner as better than the average partner

How our friends, as outsiders, rate our partners vs. us when things are good or worse

Perceptions of Control (Superiority)

People generated more positive and less negative items about their own relationships than others' relationships (Rusbult et. al. 2000) [[Experimental Study]]

Participants asked to make list of positives and negatives.

Our perceptions of superiority are strongest under threat and weakest during accuracy

![](local:///Users/braden/remnote/Braden_W/files/L7iHF9pgjyFYKVseFaxK66UCw-sL1A57xgoy5UjTnxo6800y4d5cnQqq4R-NPgU1GqrXXRBAfBelZ8beFiVFqFlSxuPd048R14Xn8nCxj9I4GCyRz2kC4E1qCdYg0wkL.png) 1. Unrealistic optimism about the relationship → Overconfident about success of relationship, think it will last much longer than we should feel

Optimism

For undergraduates in a relationships, self beliefs did not predict relationship status at follow up, but relationship beliefs predicted relationship status at follow-up. The more **positive illusions**, the better (Helgeson, 1994)

![](local:///Users/braden/remnote/Braden_W/files/BPQdEA626Bk94cRDhOkn1oGwQbta4X30DMfW7IBmtzmqYzmI1yUiNJQKcrbmGYzip22YI1mvt6n9C-POeyJw6nIQ_4ifQcOVcfYajhLLy4QF0mc-4AhbzXitLT3dPYvt.png)

The more participants reframed the negatives, the higher reported relational well-being and positive illusions (Murray, Holmes & Griffin, 1996) [[Experimental Study]]

Lecture 11 [October 7th, 2021] [Positive Illusions] Continued

The benefits of [Positive Illusions] suggest causality

Also led to longer lasting and healthier relationships

Why do Positive Illusions work?→[Self-fulfilling prophecy]

Too much over [Positive Illusions]

Over-improved partners sat further away from partners (Tomlinson et al, 2014) [[Experimental Study]]

![](local:///Users/braden/remnote/Braden_W/files/3J7YzP9hGhsdGHwY6zjy-Ly-eni6rHHo9QUZY09QxyaXwly9_g9F8F9nJ0aBkznUyPcfdaLEdB2NLS8wnQ7O33KVbqXGYiNSC_brKB4Z9FzufT3XJPNpL1obTmMUudJs.png)

Measured how close to each other they sat on a sofa (with vertical stripes) afterwards

It's possible that people may not be able to initiate long term and short term relationships based on romantic interest alone [[Experimental Study]]

 We typically find out whether or not someone is long term or short term by the 11th [Relationship Events]

For most of the time, it is the first sexual encounter

Most encounters of sex are within the context of an intimate relationship (research on sexual behavior across 59 countries) (Wellings et al., 2006) [[Experimental Study]]

# Sex

## The Importance of Sex

### Happy Sexual Relationship Rated as Important Quality for All Relationships

## Consent

### Like Giving Tea
8 of 10 rape cases are by people they knew, 1 in 2 by intimate partner

Sexual satisfaction and relationship satisfaction are linked

Sexual Afterglow → When couples had sex, they tended to be more satisfied up to 3 days later

Couples who have sex more frequently are satisfied with their sex lives

Couples who have longer sex are more satisfied, independent from frequency

Relationship between satisfaction and sexual frequency plateaus at weekly (correlation)

![](local:///Users/braden/remnote/Braden_W/files/9CMzKF9kRnkj4Trmq6WGABX6-pSRR7mhUlD18KNENSjtgc9QI4Fwn2zi4qcGphx7xhjMpGeHqa70gw07U5hZ5ML2VtkOEfD2jRn5bydIHfxVon9WN9xNy30hEFxb_rrE.png)

Motivations

Approach motivations → Seeking certain types of intimacy

Avoidance motivations → Afraid of losing something, want to people to stay

Asexuality

Can have satisfying romantic relationships without sex or sexual attraction

Response to sexual encounters can vary, and asexual and sexual dyad members can have negotiations

Affectionate touch → Touch behavior that is intended to demonstrate affection

Lecture 12 [October 12th, 2021] Affectionate Touch and Sex

Affectionate touch after sex (Muise et al., 2014) [[Experimental Study]]

On days when participants spent more time engaging in affectionate touch after sex, they reported greater sexual satisfaction

Greater relationship satisfaction 3 months later

Kissing more frequently for 6 months had correlation to greater satisfaction (Floyd et. Al 2009)

Sexual interdependence dilemmas → Your own sexual needs and interests are not aligned with partner

(Muise, Impett, & Desmarais, 2013)

Sexual desire discrepancy (type of [Sexual interdependence dilemmas])→One desires sex and the other less so

When actor reports having sex for avoidance reasons, partner reports lower satisfaction

If you feel partner has sex for avoidance reasons (regardless if true) your perception decreases

Sexual communal strength → The degree of "otherly" focus to meet a partner's sexual needs

Positively linked to likelihood of engaging in sex, sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction for both side

Rejecting sex kindly

Do: Communicate positively, reassure partner that you love them, offer alternative forms of physical contact

Don't: Display frustration, criticize the way initialized because it makes them vulnerable

On days in which partners [Rejecting sex kindly] positively, positive effect on relationship (Kim et al., 2018)

Monogamy

Sexual interdependence dilemmas are a problem for not romantic relationships, but monogamy

It's possible to fulfill needs elsewhere

Only 3% of ~5k mammal species form lifelong monogamous bonds

Social monogamy → Pair bonding for strategic reasons

Possible cause of monogamy → Paternal investment to help solve infant helplessness

Did not "evolve", but is a consequence of culture

![](local:///Users/braden/remnote/Braden_W/files/GJ10vw2A2mz18zukjwwegoBNIYV2hl4Tihjv07wH7lrgrfDaWtV9IDGX1DWauRMa2GREtbJXOOxaoWPeC_BUrBU8bdI2PYNt9h4jrNz5lnD0klKsbc_4YhUaENTRCDjW.png)

Sociosexuality → Motivation to pursue sex without commitment

Higher sociosexuality led to negative initial relationship satisfaction for individual, negative over time relationship satisfaction for **partner** (French et al., 2019)

Consensual non-monogamy (CNM) → Both partners openly agree that they will have other sexual or romantic partners

~4-5% of people engage in consensual non-monogamy

Types

Swinging → Couple engages in extra-dyadic sex, usually at parties or settings where both partners are present

Open relationships → Couple pursues independent sexual relationships outside primary dyad

Polyamory → Having consensual loving and romantic relationships with more than one partner

Perceptions of [Consensual non-monogamy (CNM)]

People in monogamous relationships perceived as: ↓

Higher in trust

Higher in intimacy

More stable

More romantic/in love

More secure

Sexually safer

But CNM are actually equal levels of

Commitment

Longevity

Satisfaction

Passion

Love

No difference between monogamous, open, and polyamorous relationships, relatively high levels of relationship quality across all three (Seguin et al., 2017)

Couples looking into CNM prospectively (Murphy et al., 2020)

No evidence that engaging in CNM had a negative impact on relationship quality

Those who engaged in CNM experienced positive change in sexual satisfaction

Those who kept relationship closed experienced negative change in sexual satisfaction

Sexual fantasies → Any mental picture that comes to mind that generate sexual arousal

97% of have sexual fantasies (Lehmiller, 2018)

Three most common sexual fantasies - Group sex (33% reporting as favorite of all time) 1. BDSM (25% reporting as favorite of all time) 1. Novelty, adventure, and variety (new sex acts, locations, sex toys) (20% reporting as favorite of all time)
