## Question 1
1. Within a long-term relationship, sharing novel activities can increase relationship satisfaction (Reissman et al. 1993). I would recommend something exciting, such as hiking or cliff jumping, since this could cause additional misattribution of arousal, create a perception that the relationship is exciting, and can facilitate cooperation.

2. Outside of the relationship, Ryan can expand through self-improvement, exploration, and the broadening of perspective. He can consider traveling abroad, or picking up new skills to expand himself. Notably, he might also experience the Michelangelo Effectâ€”our partners support and help shape us towards our own ideal self. For example, it's feasible that Carly, upon hearing Ryan wants to lose weight, helps Ryan achieve that with encouragement to eat healthier and exercise.

## Question 2
1. Being self-compassionate: Morgan should be kind to themself, be mindful, and recognize their humanity and feelings. In a study, higher levels of self-compassion in divorcees expressing themselves were linked with lower divorce-related distress up to 9 months later (Sbarra et al, 2012). In other words, Morgan should be forgiving to themself and ex partner, take the best from the experience, and find a way to move confidently.

2. Morgan could seek a rebound relationship or a new partner. A study demonstrated that those who were dating someone new post-break-up reported more confidence in their desirability and fewer residual feelings for their ex compared to those that were still single (Brumbaugh & Fraley, 2015).

## Question 3
1. Effective communication varies across SES: for low socioeconomic status partners, demand-withdraw communication patterns with a partner (when one partner withdraws from a conversation in response to another partner's requests) is constructive (rather than destructive for middle-class and higher SES) because the partner is unable to address demands from their lack of resources. This withdrawal protects the couple from conflicting over difficult or impossible to resolve issues (Ross et al, 2019).

2. There is also a pattern where higher SES partners "get to" perceive effective communication as their biggest reported problem, whereas lower SES partners list the challenges of being poor (Karney et al., 2003). This isn't to say that lower SES partners have better communication. The problem still persists but is superseded by more pressing issues associated with low SES. It suggests that communication being the most difficult issue is a privilege.

## Question 4
1. During your discussion, it is important to engage in active listening to establish effective communication. This means paraphrasing (checking that what you think your partner is saying is accurate with them), perception checking, and validation (acknowledging the legitimacy of their feelings).

2. BirthdayBaker should avoid any criticism (attacking the person's personality or character instead of identifying the behavior that is causing the concern), contempt (mocking), defensiveness (making excuses or cross-complaining), or stonewalling (withdrawing). These responses have a negative effect on conflict resolution.

## Question 5
1. Friendships in childhood are based on acceptance, whereas later friendships are based on intimacy, similarity, etc. Attachment needs also shift from being fulfilled by parents to being fulfilled by friends (Fraley & Davis, 1997). It's possible that old friends cannot meet the evolving intimacy needs we get as we grow older, or satisfy the new attachment needs that we no longer seek to fulfill through our parents.

2. Life circumstances can shape reinvestments in our friendships. For example, 1st-year college students were observed replacing most high school friendships with college friendships (Shaver et al., 1985). It's possible that we are in different stages in our lives and no longer in circumstances that make these relationships as convenient or easy as they used to be. We could also bring in socioemotional selectivity theory, where changes in interpersonal goals drive changes in our social networks (and our net of connections could become more focused over time).

## Question 6
1. Social worlds: Safiya can consider watching her favorite TV shows (or finding new ones). Participants reported feeling less lonely while viewing their favorite TV shows (Derrick, Gabriel, & Hugenberg, 2009).

2. Reminders of others: Safiya can consider eating comfort food, which satisfies both physical and emotional needs. The comfort may stem from cognitive associations with relationship partners (Troisi & Gabriel 2011).
