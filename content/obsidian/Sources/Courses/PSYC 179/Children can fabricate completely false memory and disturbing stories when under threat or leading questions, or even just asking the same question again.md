# Children Can Fabricate Completely False Memory and Disturbing Stories When Under Threat or Leading Questions, or Even Just Asking the Same Question Again
Ceci's studies

## Children Gives Lots of False Perceptual Detail When Ridiculous Questions Are Repeated Over Time
1. Asked ridiculous questions
   1. "Have you ever seen a crocodile eating an apple in a plane"
   2. "Has your finger ever caught in a mousetrap"
2. Repeat the same questions over and over again over time
3. **The children would answer the questions differently over time**

- Adding anatomically accurate doll didn't make stories more accurate, but actually **less** - Child claims that doctor hammered a stick in her vagina, but doctor had not touch private parts at all.

There are lots of adults who may be imprisoned because of false testimonies from children

When looking at [[Cost-benefit analysis for experimental design]], there are several costs that we have incurred by implanting false traumatic memories
