# Linguistic determinism
Language limits/determines thought. The words we possess determine the things that we can know. In contrast to [[Linguistic Prescription]].

## Evidence for
1. [[Hindi and Salish Speakers Can Decipher Nearly Identical Tones Closer to English Speakers. English Infants Had This Ability but Lost It.]]
2. [[English (who have words for blue and green) and Tarahuma speakers (who have the same word for blue and green) saw different colors ]]
3. [[Russians are better at identifying blue]]

[[Categorical perception]]

## Evidence Against
[[Chinese, English, and Spanish speakers use different sorting by name vs. similarity]]

## Conclusion
1. Language limits/determines thought
	- Only some evidence supports claim
2. Evidence against
	- Despite differences in language, strong correlations in sorting based on similarity
	- [[Chinese, English, and Spanish speakers use different sorting by name vs. similarity]]
