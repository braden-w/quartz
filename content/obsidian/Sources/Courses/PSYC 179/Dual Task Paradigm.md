# Dual Task Paradigm
- Performing two tasks at the same time, like listening to music while studying
- Some dual tasks are harder than others
	- Example: Singing while studying
	- Our mind has various [[Modularity - More like Magic|modules]] (language, motor, spatial reasoning)
	- Performing two tasks using the same [[Modularity - More like Magic|modules]] (talking while listening) is hard
	- Performing two tasks using different [[Modularity - More like Magic|modules]] (talking while driving) is easier
