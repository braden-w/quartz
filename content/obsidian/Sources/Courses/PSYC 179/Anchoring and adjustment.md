# Anchoring and Adjustment
- People often make estimates from starting at an initial value (anchor) and adjusting to yield final answer
- How tall is Danny Devito? How tall is Hillary Clinton? Anchored from average of 5'9
- problem: we are heavily swayed by our anchors and don't adjust enough from them

## Why Does Anchoring Happen?
1. Anchoring effects are the result of the enhanced accessibility of anchor-consistent information
	- Anchoring rings different examples in your mind that are close to the anchor
2. The semantic activation [[4. School/PSYC 179/Priming]]
	- Anchor activates concepts that are close to it

 3. Pure Numeric [[4. School/PSYC 179/Priming]]
	 - An anchor activates numeric values that are close to it

## Evolutionary Explanation
	 [[4. School/PSYC 179/Priming]]
	 
	 When we are first presented with an anchoring piece of information, the first thing we do is to mentally test whether it is a plausible value for whatever target object or situation we are considering. We do this by building a mental representation of the target. For example, if I were to ask you whether the Mississippi River is longer or shorter than 3,000 miles, you might try to imagine the north-south extension of the United States, and use that to try to figure out the answer.
