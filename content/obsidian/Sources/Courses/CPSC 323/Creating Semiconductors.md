# Creating Semiconductors

## Three Main Chip Producers
1. Intel
2. TSMC
3. GF
4. Samsung (Sometimes)

## Parts

### Tubes
300 nm wide tubes

### Wafers
Cut from [[#Tubes]]

## Steps
1. Separate impurities at very high temperature (try to get only one oxygen atom in 10 mil Silicon atoms)
2. Pure silica forms [[#Tubes]]
3. Cut [[#Tubes]] into [[#Wafers]]
  Pure silicon creates switches, which creates chips to put on a [[#Wafers]]
  We introduce impurities into silicon (using Boron and Phosphorus) to enable holes and switches
