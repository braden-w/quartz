# Dark Silicon
- The amount of circuitry of an integrated circuit that cannot be powered-on at the nominal operating voltage

## Dark Silicon Era
- To improve performance, we should put more transistors on the chip
- But we are only allowed to turn on a subset of these transistors because otherwise we would introduce too much power
