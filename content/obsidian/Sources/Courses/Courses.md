- YUDI Finance
	- Accrual Accounting
		- GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)↔Guidelines accountants use to prepare financial reports
			- revenue is “earned” by a company when it provides→a good or service
			- revenue and expense does not need to be incurred {{at the same time}} as cash is being received
			- for example, say Toyota buys $10MM in car parts from suppliers in 2020, but doesn’t sell the cars those parts were used to make until 2022. The $10MM expense will be counted on the Income Statement in the year→2022
			- Apple pays one of its software engineers a $300,000 salary in a lump-sum payment at the end of each year. Six months into the year, Apple has incurred {{$150,000}} in expenses even though they have paid {{$0}} in cash.
			- An industrial bakery buys $2MM in flour which it will use to make bread and pays immediately in cash. At the time of payment, {{$0}} in expenses have been incurred. Over the next year, the company sells $5MM worth of bread, in which it used $1MM of the aforementioned flour. Throughout that year, the company has incurred {{$1MM}} of expenses associated with its flour $2MM purchase.
	- Three major financial statements that are fundamental to financial analysis ↓
		- Income Statement:: Understanding revenues and expenses using [Accrual Accounting](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/YUDI Finance/Accrual Accounting.md) #[[Accrual Accounting]] ↓
			- all listed items are↔taxable
			- general structure ↓
				- Revenue
				- COGS
				- Gross Profit↔[Revenue](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/YUDI Finance/Three major financial statements that are fundamental to financial analysis/Income Statement:: Understanding revenues and expenses using Accrual Accounting/general structure/Revenue.md) - [COGS](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/YUDI Finance/Three major financial statements that are fundamental to financial analysis/Income Statement:: Understanding revenues and expenses using Accrual Accounting/general structure/COGS.md)
				- Gross Profit Margin↔Percent of revenue left after cost.[Gross Profit](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/YUDI Finance/Three major financial statements that are fundamental to financial analysis/Income Statement:: Understanding revenues and expenses using Accrual Accounting/general structure/Gross Profit.md) / Revenue
				- Operating Expenses↔Anything not directly related to price of goods made
					- SG&A↔Selling, General & Administrative Expense
					- R&D
					- D&A
				- Operating Income↔Total earnings before tax and interest. Gross Profit - Operating Expenses
				- Non-operating costs↔Not reflective of operating costs. Lawsuits, sudden fires, emergencies, etc.
				- Pre-Tax Income↔All revenues and expenses except tax. Operating Income - Interest Expense + Other Income
				- Tax Expense↔Applied % tax to all previous items, because all listed items are taxable
				- Net Income↔Total earnings left for investors after all previous summed. The sum of all revenues and expenses
				- Interest Payments
			- The income statement shows the revenues a company earns and the expenses they incur over a given period of time. Revenues and expenses are accounted for using the accrual accounting method. The sum of all these revenues and expenses lead to a figure called net income, which is a measure of profitability.
		- Cash Flow Statement
			- purpose is to reconcile→the difference [Net Income](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/YUDI Finance/Three major financial statements that are fundamental to financial analysis/Cash Flow Statement/Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)/Net Income.md) and the actual flow of cash
			- corrects for→depreciation/invisible costs and untaxed income
			- Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) ↓
				- Net Income
				- ADD D&A
				- SUBTRACT Accounts Receivable because it hasn't come yet
				- SUBTRACT Inventory because increasing inventory means cash has flowed out
				- ADD Accounts Payable because we still have the money/haven't paid it out yet
				- Pattern Cis to {{ add }} changes in liabilities and {{ subtract }} changes in assets.
			- Cash Flow from Investing (in capital and other companies) (CFI) ↓
				- Capital Expenditures (CapEx)↔PP&E
				- Purchase/Sales of Securities↔Selling/Buying stocks of other companies
				- M&A Activity
			- Cash Flow from Financing (CFF) ↓
				- Equity Issuing/Buybacks
				- Debt Issuing/Repayment
				- Dividend
			- As we learned above, a revenue or expense on the income statement (under accrual accounting) does not necessarily align with an inflow or outflow of cash. Therefore, the net income figure at the bottom of the income statement almost never reflects net inflow or outflow of cash. The cash flow statement is used to reconcile this net income figure to a “change in cash” figure that reflects actual cashflow. In other words, it starts with net income and makes the appropriate adjustments so that we know how much cash entered/left the company in aggregate. Like the income statement, this is showing change over a given period of time.
		- Balance Sheet
			- used as→snapshot of current assets, debt, equity
			- Assets, Debt, Equity Equation↔Assets = Debt (aka Liabilities) + Equity
			- Assets ↓
				- Cash
				- Inventory
				- Accounts Receivable
				- Prepaid Expenses
				- Marketable Securities
				- Net PP&E
				- Goodwill↔Giving more than a company asks for when buying out and acquiring their assets
			- Liabilities ↓
				- Accounts Payable
				- Deferred Revenue
				- Short Term Debt
				- Long Term Debt
			- Equity ↓
				- Common Stock↔# Shares * Par Value
				- Additional Paid-In Capital (APIC)↔# Shares * (Share Price - Par Value)
				- [Common Stock](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/YUDI Finance/Three major financial statements that are fundamental to financial analysis/Balance Sheet/Equity/Common Stock.md) + [Additional Paid-In Capital (APIC)](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/YUDI Finance/Three major financial statements that are fundamental to financial analysis/Balance Sheet/Equity/Additional Paid-In Capital (APIC).md)→Total Cashflows from stock issuance #[[Additional Paid-In Capital (APIC)]]
				- Treasury Stock↔Amount of money spent repurchasing shares
					- it's a Contra-Equity because↔increasing treasury stock decreases equity, there is less of the pie to be financed
				- Retained Earnings↔Sum of all periods' (net income - dividends)
			- The balance sheet shows a snapshot of company’s asset, liability, and equity items at a specific point in time (unlike the IS and CFS, which show change over a given period of time).
				- The key accounting equation that defines the balance sheet is Assets = Liabilities + Equity
	- Questions
		- Basic understanding of each of the three financial statements and what purpose they each serve.
		- How accrual accounting works and whether or not revenue is considered "earned" in a hypothetical transaction that we present you with.
			- [revenue is “earned” by a company when it provides](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/YUDI Finance/Accrual Accounting/GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)/revenue is “earned” by a company when it provides.md) goods and services
		- General structure of income statement (all listed line items and what each means).
		- General structure of cash flow statement; only need to know the three major sections, and a basic understanding of what each section shows (no need to know specific line items in each section).
		- General structure of balance sheet (the three major components); know at least two major items in each of the three components
	- Week 1: DCF's
		- DCF
			- Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) assumes that a company is worth the {{ sum}} of all its future cash flows, discounted to the present to account for the time value of money.
			- DCF is an {{ intrinsic }} valuation method, meaning it doesn't rely on the valuation of other companies.
			- Two parts: Explicit + Terminal Periods
			- Steps for Explicit
				- Step 1: Project our FCFF
					- EBIT↔Operating Income
					- Find [EBIT](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/YUDI Finance/Week 1: DCF's/DCF/Steps for Explicit/Step 1: Project our FCFF/EBIT.md)
					- Project Cash Flows
					- Project Change in Net Working Capital (Current Assets - Current Liabilities)
					- FCF = EBIT * (1-Tax Rate)
				- Step 2: Discounting Cash Flows
					- The discount rate used in DCF is the {{ WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Cpital)}}
					- WACC↔Cost of Equity * (E/(E+D)) + Cost of Debt * (D/(E+D)) * (1-Tax)
					- 2a. Cost of equity
						- Cost of Equity is found using the {{ Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)}}
						- Cost of Equity = R_rf + Beta * (R_m-R_rf)
							- ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/PXv-2mK889ngAf4mBBBSkMRVSBj11HDv-SgPbaDXchSAiu5yeBZAZQX2wWraHZT_ppegf_VY5W-ZA1doYA8fgSMSuRnPCyW_gbb4UadW63LA0mP6TXBx-Qs2wab0PuZ3)
							- $R_{rf}$→$$Risk-free rate of return$$
							- Beta of the equity↔Correlation to the market
								- What's the beta of a slot machine?→0. Because a slot machine is not dependent on the market.
							- Rate of the return of the market
							- “What does beta represent, in plain English?”↔The risk of the company relative to the risk of the stock market as a whole.
			- Steps for Terminal
				- Two methods: Perpetuity Growth Method or Exit Multiples Method
				- Perpetuity Growth Method↔assumes cash flows will continue until infinity, and will grow a low stable rate
					- FCF↔First Year Cash Flow
					- “What is the formula for unlevered [FCF](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/YUDI Finance/Week 1: DCF's/DCF/Steps for Terminal/Perpetuity Growth Method/FCF.md) ?”↔FCF = EBIT * (1 – Tax Rate)
						- + D&A
						- CapEx
						- Change in NWC
					- General perpetuity formula↔Present value = Initial payment/(Discount rate - Growth rate)
					- Terminal Value formula↔Terminal Value = [FCF](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/YUDI Finance/Week 1: DCF's/DCF/Steps for Terminal/Perpetuity Growth Method/FCF.md) at T+ 1/(WACC-g) = ([FCF](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/YUDI Finance/Week 1: DCF's/DCF/Steps for Terminal/Perpetuity Growth Method/FCF.md) at T)(1+g) / (WACC-g) where T is the number of years we explicitly forecast
				- Exit Multiple Method↔assumes that
					- Look at ratios that peer companies are being traded at, assume company will be sold at a {{ similar ratio }} at the end of the explicit forecast
	- Week 2: Private Equity
		- Private Equity Firms
			- Private Equity Funds↔separate branches of Private Equity Firms, for legal reasons, vs. firms as the master branch
			- How they make money
				- Management fee↔Often near 2%
				- Carry↔Slice of profits, often after thresholds
			- Why is PE profit a lot
			- LBO↔Leveraged Buyouts - Acquire with lots of debt
			- Multiple of Money (MoM)↔How much we've multiplied our money before exit (New Equity/Old Equity)
			- Internal Rate of Return (IRR)↔Annualized effect of compounding interest rate
				- formula→(Original Investment) (1+IRR)^T=Final Value&
	- Semester Review
		- Enterprise Value
		- Equity Value
		- Comparable companies analysis↔Valuation based off metrics of similar companies in same markett
		- Precedent transaction analysis↔Valuation based off past buyouts of similar companies
		- DCF Basics
			- What are the basic steps of a DCF?→![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/pH1fIu4LUBShhh313BiFbIHL369h-DPvI-SOk1uxU0DdfVM1S9Vqs7LIETd-q5iNt2qIdaWYJ_o3sEhObgQQTjCSBOwoOgbGn-CK_CTXUn6trOFe5MHdMjh12vdcHhw2.png)
			- What is the discount rate used? How is this calculated?→Discount rate is often from the [WACC](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/YUDI Finance/Week 1: DCF's/DCF/Steps for Explicit/Step 2: Discounting Cash Flows/WACC.md)
				- ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/vPKcq9qA32YZtqzKiuMmJLZirrOvghtMoarCW0zUF_OLNcMa7-E-XwR1zwo1N-x9_YYzFlrquEd3vaQFC6bkRVnmYiOk78yE5pVdxU93gJyVwmYSWUFYH8rEJ4c_vuc2.png)
			- What is the CAPM model for finding Cost of Equity?
			- What is Beta a measure of?
			- What sort of assumptions go into a DCF?
			- What are the two methods for finding terminal value?
		- What is, and what drives, an LBO model?
