# Reading Kuran and Gladwell for Galvanized Masses
Kuran

Kuran describes how the fall of the Soviet Union was abrupt and shocking, even to those who were anticipating it. The resulting shockwaves created many consecutive revolutions and a “revolution bandwagon”, which are revolutions only possible when the state can no longer maintain the status quo and fails to enforce law and order. The events that transpired challenged aspects of game theory that suggest people are willing to be permissive and let others make sacrifices as long as they collect the good of a revolution. Overall, the galvanized masses suggest that citizens were more wiling to protest than expected, especially or perhaps explained by their perceiving that it was safe to do so.

Gladwell

Gladwell writes about the effects social media has played on collective action social movements and protests. His article critiques the idea that social media helps protests through their ability to transmit ideas quickly through a platform. In particular, contrasting this to historic boycotts and marches in high-risk scenarios, Gladwell critiques that social media lacks the level of planning and organization of these historic marches. Additionally, the ties of social media are often weak and that of association, meaning that members often lack the ties necessary to make coordinated efforts.
