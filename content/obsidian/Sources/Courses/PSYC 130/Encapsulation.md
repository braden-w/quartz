# Encapsulation
- Internal information processing in the module cannot be accessed or affected by information in the rest of the brain
- Explains mental reflexes

What do you have access to?

## Examples
- Optical Illusions that happen at the [[Implementation]] level and are inaccessible by the [[Computational]] level
	- [[Whatever's responsible for visual illusions are innate to human nature or genetic endowment]]

## [[Domain Specificity]] is not the same as [[Encapsulation]]
- [[Domain Specificity]] is more related to [[Algorithmic]] level while [[Encapsulation]] is more related to more [[Computational]]
