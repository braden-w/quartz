# On Instinct Blindness and Fluency: The Exciting Application of Instinct Blindness, Fluency, and Simulation Theory Research in Teaching

# Outline
1. Instinct Blindness
2. Fluency
3. Theory theory

In the Queen’s Gambit, the main protagonist quickly acquires skills to become a world-class chess player. The show simultaneously depicts her ease of skill acquisition as well as frustration in explaining her moves to others—as she exclaims to one of her friends, Harry,  “can’t you see it?” when offered help from them. The “visualizations” shown in Queen's Gambit are extraordinary and is a skill that other members simply lack.

It seems to be a common trope in pop culture that the most excellent performers in fields just “get” something. Mozart’s widow destroyed some 90% of her husband’s sketches, to reinforce the appearance that her husband was a virtuoso and was able to construct pieces in his head.

However, examples like these may prompt the following question: why is it that the best often struggle to explain their and do not necessarily excel in teaching? The best concert pianists are not necessarily the best music teachers. The best athletes are not necessarily the best coaches. The best researchers are not necessarily the best teachers. Why is it that the best performers are often unable to verbalize

Suppose I am a person who know a certain skill. How can I leverage the different areas of cognitive science research to my advantage?

In this essay, we will strive to explain how numerous areas of Cognitive Science research have exciting applications in how one “gets” something.

## Instinct Blindness
A possible explanation of
The term "instinct blindness" refers to a deep-seated blindness from our own intuitions that end up leading to ignore the underlying processes of those intuitions. It is a lack of attention from tasks that have become automatic (or that started out that way – hence the term instinct).

Instinct blindness conceptually challenges the foundation of human decision making, the application of its research is lacking beyond the conceptual establishing.

Research in the field of instinct blindness is promising

## Fluent Processing
Teaching language
Why is it that the the most elite players seem to struggle to verbalize their processes?

There are services in the real world, such as Masterclass, which seek to compile

Yet, why is it that .

## Innateness
Theory theory and simulation theory (
Emphasizes toxic differences of natural talent of performers

It is the fluency in which we process information that impairs our ability to understanding underlying processes.

Unlike most research, where the goal is to add to something we instinctually do not do, instinct blindness is about something we instinctually do.

Broader applications of what we are “blind to”: what we do not know.
