# Seek the Right Level of Abstraction
- The answer must be through multiple levels. You can't go through just one of [[Marr's 3 Levels]]
- Consider the circuitry of the Comodore 64. Looking just into the circuitry will show you nothing on cognition
- You'll never be able to recognize patterns in circuitry, since the way different brains work are very different
  - [[The problem with the Connectome example]]
  - From Structure from Motion
	- The globe with a bunch of horizontal oscillating orbs looks like it's spinning counterclockwise
	- [[Structure from Motion Theorem]]
