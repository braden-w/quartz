# Adding Static Noise to Plain Images, Having Participants Discern
An example of [[Reverse Correlation]]

# General Procedure
- Add randomized filters/static noise to plain base image

* Had participants comb through many different images and add qualities

# Gender Study
- Add randomized filters/static noise to androgenous, plain base image

* Then able to discern gender
* The classification image was mostly an eye shaped one
  [[We don't detect gender based off most facial features, but by the eyes]]
