# Counter to What We Expect, [[Conservatism]] is Heritable

## Procedure
- Comparing [[MZT (Monozygotic Twins)]] and [[DZT (Dizygotic Twins)]] in light of [[Heritability]]

## Findings
- At the beginning, the [[DZT (Dizygotic Twins)]] start at a higher similarity than the [[MZT (Monozygotic Twins)]]
- [[MZT (Monozygotic Twins)]] and [[DZT (Dizygotic Twins)]] are close in levels of conservatism until around 25 years old, then huge disparities in conservatism afterwards

## Explanation
- You stay the same as you grow up
- It's after you go to school that you become what you grow into what you [[Heritability]] to be in [[Conservatism]]

## Conclusion
- [[Heritability]] does not need to be same across all ages. There are some instances where it grows
