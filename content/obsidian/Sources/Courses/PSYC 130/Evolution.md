# Evolution
- Was a [[Mystery]]
- Solved by Darwin, proof that not all [[Mystery]]s are unsolvable

- 5 Steps of [[Evolution]]
	1. Reproductive Math | geometric growing population
	2. Crunch time | finite resources and has population that is too large
	3. Nonrandomness | who survives is not a lottery
	4. Inheritance | any bias advantage would be amplified over time
		- If a mutant produces just 11% more offspring than its rivals, it can represent its representation in the population from .1% to 99.9% in just over 4000 generations
