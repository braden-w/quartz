Intro to [[Marr's 3 Levels]]

- A general rule in science…is to [[Seek the right level of abstraction]]

# Lecture 3
- [[Cognitive Architecture]]
- [[All levels are critical!]]

# Lecture 4 and 5
- [[ Nature vs. Nurture]]
- [[Heritability]] - Questions - What is the [[Heritability]] of having a nose? ^f6ed32 - Approximately 0 - What is the [[Heritability]] of wearing earrings? - Not zero - If it was 100% among women, then within women, there is no [[Heritability]] (it is like having a nose). Within men and women, there is a [[Heritability]] of 1 (we can directly attribute to traits) - What is the [[Heritability]] of wearing earrings circa 1950 in the US? - Even higher than [[PSYC 130 Introduction to Cognitive Science#^f6ed32]] - T or F: Higher [[Heritability]] ⇒ more likely to be inherited - False - T or F: Higher [[Heritability]] ⇒ less modifiable - False
- The Bell Curve
  - Controversial, the logic
  - Across white kids, intelligence is highly [[Heritability|heritable]]
  - Across black kids, intelligence is highly [[Heritability|heritable]]
  - Black kids have lower test scores
  - Murray then attributes the result to lower IQ among black people
  - Best rebuke is from the [[The two flower populations example]]
- [[Heritability]] cannot be contrasted across populations:
  - [[The two flower populations example]]
- Examples - [[Bees]] shake their butts - [[The bees innately have a notion of the sun, and that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, and know the path of the sun in the sky]] - Identical twins reared together vs apart - [[Counter to What We Expect, Conservatism is Heritable]] - ![[Pasted image 20211015152751.png]]
- Exploring "Nature" 1. Identical twins reared apart 2. Precocious infant cognition - Newborn babies spend more time looking/engaging with :) faces than scrambled faces, suggesting that there is an [[Innateness|innate]] inborn desire for scrambled faces

# Lecture 12

# Lecture 13
[[Babies have no problem with learning multiple languages at the same time, without any impacts on speed or understanding]]

## Learnability Theory
1. A class of languages
2. An environment
3. Learning strategy
4. A success criterion

### Learnability Theory Analysis

#### 4 Possible Situations (Circles with T and H)
Unconscious hypothesis to test the language and its meanings

T is the truth and H is the hypothesis

Children use positive evidence

Children do not use negative evidence

Children get very little grammatical correction — and even when they do, they don't use it

# Unconscious Language Learning Modules

## Blocking Principles
"A and B cannot co-exist."

A child hearing A can catapult B out of the language

Irregular tenses & plurals

Irregulars listed in the lexicon block application

## Subset Principles
Avoid lack of negative evidence by hypothesizing the smallest most constrained subset

Example: [[Children always err on the side of caution and use only some of allowable word-orders]]

## Phonetics
The physical nature of speech, treating language in sound waves

## [[Phonology]]
The mental representation of sounds as part of a discrete symbolic cognitive system

Many different sounds are mapped under the same symbols, which can explain why some languages are harder to acquire or discern

Japanese people cannot discern difference between ul and err sound

### Sounds ≠ Spelling
"fish" = "ghoti" if we use tou*gh*, w*o*men, na*ti*on
[i]: fee, tea, be, key, thief, Leigh
[u]: do, food, new

In spoken human languages, word sounds are not defined directly in terms of mouth gestures or noises, but as _structured_ combinations of discrete phonological elements

The phonetics are not changing (ba va tha are all phonetically identical)

## [Morphology]
The structure & formation of words

walk

walk*s*

walked

walking

moonwalk

Unit: [[Morphemes]]]

### Bound Morphemes: "-s", "-sheveled"

### Free Morpheme : "Walk"

### Prefixes
Put in beginning of word

### Suffixes
Put in end of word

### Infixes
Put in middle of word

(none in english)

Actually, there is one: "fucking"

Un-fucking-believable

Even with this, we have rules

Inter-fucking-disciplinary

We would never say unbelievable-fucking or interdisciplinary-fucking

### Inflextional
Same word class (girl -> girls)

### Derivational
Different word class (create -> creation)

[[#Derivational]]<[[#Inflextional]]: Raitonal\*ization**\*s**

### Morphology is Gratuitous
Anything a language one with morphology, it can do with syntax

English

"dogs" vs. "one or more dogs"

Chinese (the opposite of English)

"more than one dog" vs. ("dogs" in Chinese)

Unlockable can be super ambiguous, can be "can be unlocked" or "unable to be lockable"

## Why is There Syntax?

### Expressiveness
"Max want Jill cheat suspicious know we" is super ambiguous, but syntax makes it better

### Productivity
Allows us to communicate an infinity of complex and specific meanings, using only a few general tools

```ad-info
title: You can easily make a sentence that nobody else has ever done before

```

### Governance
tenses assign nominative cases, infinitives assign accusative case

# Lecture 9
1. What is the essence of something? What defines and essence. [[Feature integration]]
2. [[Theory theory]] and  [[simulation theory]]
3. Prototype Theory
[[Reading Responses#^13cd52]]
- Poison food example
- You can imagine [[simulation theory]] is like just having a taste tester
- Intentional vs. Phenomenal states
	- Corporations are believed to have intentional but not phenomenal states

# Lecture 10
[[I shot an elephant in my pajamas]]

## Semantics is Difficult
The transitive verb "to paint"

If I trip myself into paint, I have covered myself in paint, but have I painted myself?

Bachelors

## Parameterization
Basic Word Order

PRO drop

Some languages allow null subjects of tensed sentences: "Is raining" in Portugese

## Why Do We Need It?
Haiti genocide, killing people based off their pronunciation

Google hires more Cognitive Science majors than Computer Science majors

# Lecture 11 Perception and Attention
- A personal perspective
- --Concrete Progress-->
- <--Interesting--
- Vision is impossible
- In principle, it is not possible to recover the 3D structure of the physical world from only 2D retinal images
- [[Reading Responses#^c1f7c6]]

## Vision is an Illusion Problem
[[Instinct Blindness#^1b7446]]
[[Countershading as animal counterflage]]

Chalk artist examples on the street

- Diver with leg sticking up in air
- Snail on the bench
- Adidas marketing campaign, chasm
- Spinning woman where drawing a line to distinguish legs completely removes the ambiguity
	- You can switch the line randomly and people will not even notice, and think they are switching themselves quickly
- [[Instinct Blindness#^e088a3]]-
- The nature of perception—We perceive those objects and events that under normal conditions would be
- We are not seeing light reflected, but the brain's best guess on the source of the reflection—Helmholtz
- Showing the piano scrambled,
	- It is NOT because you know what a piano looks like, and are filling in the gaps
- Random trash casts beautiful shadows
- Random bars casts beautiful shadows

## Stereo Eyesight and Stereoblind
Stereotest of population

10% are stereoblind

Stereotests--show something different in each eye

There is huge computation in eyesight

There is a slight

## We Don't See Our Own Red Blood Vessels in Our Eye

# Lecture 12

## [[Sources/Courses/PSYC 130/Attention]] Features
1. Selectivity
2. Capacity limitation
3. Effort

Eye tracking simulation with 1, 2, 3, …, 6 balls

[[Our attention is much more object based]]: We struggle to focus on ends of sticks compared to objection

## Cognitive Control and Attention is Impacted by Poverty and Problems
You have way less [[ Sources/Courses/PSYC 130/Attention]] to give

[[People who are poor have more difficulty and accuracy with cognitive control]]
[[Indian Sugarcane Farmers Have Way More Cognitive Control Before Harvest Compared to Post Harvest]]

## [[Visual Search]] / Feature Search

## Featural Singletons Automatically Grab Your Attention
Red circle among white circles

Pink circle among pink rectangles

Much more effortful [[Visual Search]] when you have a white circle among red circles and white square

Parallel search, the graph is flat vs. conjunction search, the graph is upwards

[[We only see what we are attending]]

## Eyes
Your eyes move in [[Saccade]]s.

[[Your eyes cannot move in smooth motions]], but you can move your eyes in a smooth motion only once, when your eyes are closed

Our eyes move 3-5 times a second, which leads to [[Change blindness]]

Studies relating to [[Change blindness]]

1. [[We were able to take advantage of change blindness by replacing a XXXXXXXXXXXX with the underlying text wherever they looked]]
2. [[Looking at a sofa and seeing so many changes done so gradually, nobody noticed]]
3. [[People in Move In Day College Didn't Even Notice the People Talking to Them Change]]
4. [[People signing up for an experiment and don't notice that the secretary changes mid conversation]]

[[Inattentional Blindness]]

[[30% people completely miss the Red Cross across the screen while counting bumps of shapes]]

Can happen due to a lack of expectation, but also *having the wrong expectation*

Driving a car and talking at the same time (even without holding the phone) can drastically reduce your attention and cause inattentive blindness.

[[Four stroke apparent motion]]: Just switching two frames of the motorcycle gives feeling of motion
- Cells are activated only by stimuli within their receptive field

[[Chase subtlety with red circle chasing a green circle]]

Intentions and goals are wired in the visual system

[[The law of iterated expectations - If I expect something in the future, then I already expect that something in present]]
[[Inductive Reasoning]]

What percentage had 1 or more heart attacks.

What percentage are both over 60 and had 1 or more heart attacks.

[[Conjunction fallacy]]
[[Availability Heuristic]]

How many in a 2000 word knowledge do you expect to fill the following:

- _ _ _ _ _ n _ -- about 10
- _ _ _ _ i n g -- much more

Updating the estimates

[[Frequencies vs. percentages]]

Of the 1000 participants, how many had 1 or more heart attacks.

Of the 1000 participants, how many are both over 60 and had 1 or more heart attacks.

Theme: Rational !== Intuitive

Cognitive Science can reveal the differences

They matter

# Cognitive Science of Sex and Attraction
Infant Attractiveness Predicts Maternal Behaviors and Attitudes

## Why is There Sex?
- Why don't we just bud
- A defense against pathogens and parasites
	- They are trying to pick at the locks of our immune system
	- If we budded and a pathogen got ahold, we would be decimated
- Sex allows us to mix and match and protect us

The organism that can do both sex and asex

- With pathogens, sex turns on

## Parental Investment
We could be having sex instead of having children

It's exhausting

[[Minimal Parental Investment]]

Males' reproductive success depends on how many females they mate with => way more competition among males and choosiness in females

More partners -> more offspring

Suppose a foraging man w/ one wife can expect 2-5 children. A premarital or extramarital liason then increases his reproductive fitness by 20-50%

Pregnancy of women limits rate of population growth

```ad-note
So, a part of the male mind should want a variety of sexual partners for the sheer sake of variety
```

[[Questionaire + Field Studies Show Huge Disparities to Men Vs. Women in Eagerness to Have Sex]]

[[Male Pipefish Are Much Choosier Than Female Pipefish]]

[[The Handicap Principle]]

[[Strong Chin + Law Jar + Prominent Forehead as an Example of The Handicap Principle]]

[[Physical Beauty as a Cue to Health, Fertility, and Youth ]]

Beauty

1. Symmetrical face (Good indicator of fitness and disease
2. Facial averageness

Averaging faces increases attractiveness of faces

[[OCEAN]]

Highly heritable trait [[OCEAN#Conscienciousness]]

Self Resemblance

10% of one's face is morphed into the male and female faces

A little bit of you mixed in should be less attractive, but should only to that of preferred sex

Finding yourself in someone else shouldn't be desirable

Identical twins > Fraternal twins > Adoptees

But identical twin likelihood = only 20-50%

Homosexuality seems to be attributed a lot to epigenetics rather than genetics

[[Balanced Polymorphisms]]

[[Female relatives of gay men have 1.3x children as female relatives of straight men!]]

[[2021-12-02 To What Extent is Attractiveness Relative Instead of Absolute? If Everyone's Face Were to Become More "attractive" or Closer to the Average Face by the Same Amount, Would This Change Any Aspects of Modern Culture?]]
