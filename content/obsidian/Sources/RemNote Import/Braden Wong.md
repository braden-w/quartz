- Notes
	- Yale Courses
		- First Semester
				- General structure of cash flow statement; only need to know the three major sections, and a basic understanding of what each section shows (no need to know specific line items in each section).
				- General structure of balance sheet (the three major components); know at least two major items in each of the three components.
		- Alexander Hamilton Society
			- [September 28th, 2020](Daily Document/September 28th, 2020.md) The end of history
				- The End of History↔The idea that we have reached the ultimate form of government
					- description of history→linear progression
				- Positive liberty vs. Negative liberty
					- Positive liberty↔Free from government
					- Negative liberty↔Liberty to rights, clean water, etc.
				- originated from→Karl Marx
				- separates liberalism from nationalism because→generally, liberal changes were driven by nationalistic pride/revolutions
				- Hegel's belief
					- All human behavior in the material world is rooted in a prior state of consciousness
					- Yet another unfortunate legacy of Marxism is our tendency to retreat into materialist or utilitarian explanations of political or historical phenomena, and our disinclination to believe in the autonomous power of ideas

					- bijective→every B is hit exactly once. Iff both injective and surjective
				- Image of function Im(f)↔{Set of all outputs f(a)}, or {Set of all b where there exists a such that f(a)=b}
				- Countable↔A set $S$ is countable iff there exists a surjection such that g: $\mathbb{N}$--> $S$
					- $\mathbb{Z}$ is→countable ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/0mxPql3M43TIeZtJdPstth6FpFHDvRg-RstZQkUC8ezlwZ4KCKwl1lNnzTZ7EAYc2yzBxCK-_SszrQ4FkZjfp9gdTIAIUDARLnnkpGYrE4wCStNCg_Ll_-DWNe43XJRX) The right side covers all Z using natural numbers
					- Any set that you can describe is countable (even numbers, odd integers, etc.)
					- Cantor's diagonal argument↔(0,1) is not countable
						- proof by→contradiction. Suppose (0,1) is countable and therefore f(N) -> (0,1) is a surjection. This means that for all $b\in (0,1)$there exists$a$such that $f(a)=b$

						- Implications ↓
							- $R$is uncountable
							- $Q\neq R$ since $Q$ is countable and $R$ is not$$
							- There are real numbers that can't be described in any way$$
				- Lower, upper bounds, sup, inf
					- Given $S\subseteq R$ $$
						- $L\in R$is a lower bound iff→for all $x\in S$ , $L\leq x$ .
						- $U\in R$is a lower bound iff→for all $x\in S$ , $U\geq x$ .
						- Supremum sup()↔Least of upper bound for S
						- Infinum inf()↔Greatest of lower bound for S
						- sups, infs, lower, and upper bounds do not {{need to belong}} in $S$
						- difference between bounds and sup or inf→bounds can be any number and there are infinite bounds. However, there is only one sup or inf
					- warmup: Find set $S\in R$ with no sup or inf→$R$ has no sup or inf, any set that extends infinitely in a direction
						- find a set with a inf but no sup→$N$
					- $\empty$
						- how many upper and lower bounds?→infinitely many
						- sup or inf?→none, because infinitely many bounds $$$$
					- $R$ is dedekind complete→If $S$ is nonempty set of $R$ and $S$ has an upper bound, it has a least upper bound (sup). If $S$ has lower bound, it has a greatest upper bound (inf).$$ #Theorem
						- If $S\subseteq R$ then S has at most one sup and one inf #Proposition
							- prove this by↔contradiction. Suppose $x$ and $y$ are both sups of S. Then both$x$and$y$ are least upper bounds. So $x\leq y$because $x$ is a least upper bound and $y$ is an upper bound. Likewise $y\leq x$because $y$ is a least upper bou nd and $x$ is an upper bound. Therefore $x=y$ . $$
						- use the above in the following proof::: ↓
							- Suppose $S\subseteq R$ , $S\neq 0$and $S$has an upper bound. We prove a least upper bound $L$exists by creating one digit at a time. We use the inspiration from$\sqrt 2$. You keep on increasing the next digit until it's just under an upper bound, giving us $L$.
							- We now prove that $L$is the least upper bound, or that for all $x\in S$that $x\leq L$. Use contradiction to find $x>L$. Now compare $x$ and $L$'s first few digits until they differ$$
							- ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/ew14TSFTm6N10TrLFFa44KtM1hxwb7nj6d3KTzprrEQYP2Bc3vbJyATQaXcA7n2AfEBx7KCgbHcX_BX7_dwYXLHSWsAZhFGbzgcseeOJhLghsLmjiF3zU6iJUx30sDoV)
							- This digit of $x$ must be bigger than $L$. However, from the manner in which we formed $L$, this is impossible, because every digit of $L$ is as big as possible without being too big. Therefore, $$$x\leq L$.$$
						- ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/7g55QaZyEeKb2lGX4QuyPOEMg9ko1BW7EFv-kAyDw_I89C_MHWx1FKqM2TrpiAMol2qR8HZHhlOQk-11ip33S8iYpMcxNgQ_M-g3T-VW3at8b9BTD7Q6NvqFSQzVH3Wq)
						- $R$ is the only set with [R is dedekind complete](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/Math 230/Sets/Lower, upper bounds, sup, inf/R is dedekind complete.md)$$ and is an ordered field.
					- For all $x\in R$, if $x>0$ , then there exists $y\in R$ such that $0<y<x$ #Theorem
						- proof→let $y=\frac{x}{2}.$ $\square$
					- For all $x\in R$, if $x>0$ , then there exists $y\in Q$ such that $0<y<x$ #Theorem
						- proof→let $y$ be $x$ all the way until the first nonzero digit. After that, set the remaining digits of $y$ to zero. Optionally, divide $y$ by two. This guarantees a rational number output.
				- Maximums and minimums
					- $L$ is the minimum iff $L\in S$ and $L=\inf(S)$ .
					- $L$ is the maximum iff $L\in S$ and $L=\sup(S)$ .

					- $a_n$is decreasing iff→for all $n\in N$ ,$a_{n+1}\leq a_n$ . Strictly decreasing if < not <=
					- Monotone iff→$a_n$always is [ a_n is decreasing iff](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/Math 230/Sets/Sequence/ a_n is decreasing iff.md) or [ a_n is increasing iff](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/Math 230/Sets/Sequence/ a_n is increasing iff.md)
					- Monotone Convergence Theorem↔$a_n$ is a sequence of reals. If $a_n$ is monotone and bounded, the sequence converges
				- Limits (of a [Sequence](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/Math 230/Sets/Sequence.md))
					- definition→Say $a_n$ is a sequence of reals and $L\in R$ . $L$ is the limit iff for all $\epsilon > 0$there exists $N \in N$ such that for all $n>N$, $|a_n-L|<\epsilon$ .
						- The difference between $a_n$ and limit L is approaching zero
					- $a_n \rightarrow L$ means that [Sequence](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/Math 230/Sets/Sequence.md)$a_n$is approaching L
					- If $a_n$ is a [Sequence](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/Math 230/Sets/Sequence.md) and $a_n \rightarrow L_1$and $a_n \rightarrow L_2$ , then $L_1=L_2$$$
					- [September 25th, 2020](Daily Document/September 25th, 2020.md)
					- Triangle inequality↔$|a+b|\leq |a|+|b|$
						- $|x_1+x_2+…+x_i|\leq |x_1|+|x_2|+|x_3|….+|x_i|$
							- We prove this through rewriting this as $|(x_1+x_2+…+x_{i-1})+x_i|\leq |x_1+x_2+…+x_{i-1}|+|x_i|$.
					- $x_n=(-1)^n$ does not converge
					- $xa_n\to xA+y \iff \forall \epsilon>0, \exist N\in N, \forall n>N, |xa_n+y-(xA+y)|<\epsilon.$
				- Continuous↔Let $A\subseteq R$ and f:$a\to$ R, and $x\in A$. We say f is continuous at $x$ iff $\forall \epsilon > 0, \exist \delta>0$ such that $\forall y \in A$, if $|x-y|<\delta,$then $|f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon$.

					- example→Prove that $f: R\to R$ via $f(x)=x^2$ is continuous
						- proof→We are trying to find that for all $\epsilon >$0, there exists $\delta$ such that if $|x-y|<\delta$, then $|f(x)-f(y)|=|x^2-y^2|<\epsilon.$
							- Let $x\in R$ be arbitrary. Let $\epsilon>0$ be arbitrary.
							- Our goal is to set $\delta$ to a convenient value
								- $|f(x)-f(y)|=|x^2-y^2|=|x-y||x+y|<\delta\cdot|x+y|$
								- The big jump is to write $|x+y|$as $|2x+(y-x)|$
								- ^^$\delta|2x+(y-x)|\leq \delta(|2x|+|y-x|)\leq \delta(2|x|+\delta)\leq \delta(2|x|+1)\leq \delta$^^
							- Therefore, $|f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon$

				- Linear independence↔Let $V$ be a vector space over $F$, and $S\subseteq V$. We say $S$ is linearly independent iff $\sum_{i=1}^k c_i\vec s_i = \vec 0$ implies $c_1=c_2=c_3=c_4=…=c_k=0$ . Otherwise, $S$ is linearly independent.
					- Inspiration: $span(\{1, x, x^2, x^3, x^4\}) = span({1, x, x^2, x^3+2x, x^4-2}) = (\text{All polynomials of degree}\leq 4)$ but there is redundancy for the second expression.

					2. $span(S)=V$ ↓
						- Does there exist a unique solution for $c_1x_1+c_2x_2+…+c_kx_k=y$ for all $y$ ?
				- Proposiition↔Say $V$ is a vector space over $F$ and $S = \{s_1, s_2, …, s_k\} \subseteq V$ . Then consider $T:F^k \to V$ via $T \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ … \\ x_k \end{pmatrix} = x_1s_1+x_2s_2+…+x_ks_k$ .
					- $T$ is linear

				- Proposition 28.1↔![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/IsFkYGfl0OnbvkW5JTNCx69bja7FD-ybKiAo6Ewc-v5Z3rpo5nDvsY95btFhFyNxPBs-s0tgzP4-pj-tXAWVdlt83O1NFW5p4Svar_QHZU99utBDcWIiWOK1Dtotnj5L.png)
				- Theorem 28.1↔If $T:F^n\to F^m$ is linear, then there exists a unique matrix $A \in Mat_{mxn}(F)$ such that $\forall \vec x \in F^n$, $T(\vec x) = A\vec x$

				- Proposition 29.1: If $A$ and $B$ are matrices for which $AB$ makes sense, then $T_{AB}(\vec x) = T_A \circ T_B(\vec x)$ , or $AB(\vec x) = A (B \vec x)$
					- This explains why matrix multiplication is defined as it is
					- Also explains why it's not commutative, because $T_A(T_B(\vec x)) \neq T_B(T_A(\vec x))$ . When applying linear maps (which are a type of function), the order matters. Since linear maps analogize to matrices, it works out.

			- Day 33: C^1 implies differentiability
				- $C^k$→Say $U\subseteq R^n$ is open and $f:u\to R^m.$ Then we say $f$ is $C^0$ iff $f$ is continuous. And for all $k\geq 1$, we say $f$ is $C^k$ iff every partial exists and those partials are all $C^{k-1}.$

			- Day 35, 36:
				- Smooth manifold↔A smooth manifold is a set $M\subseteq R^n$ such that
					- $M$ is (locally) the graph of a $C^1$ function $f:u\to R^n$ where $u\subseteq R^n$ is open
					- This is called an {{ n-dimensional }} manifold
						- Locally, $n$ variables determine the rest
					- Locally means you can zoom in at a point $\vec p$
						- $\exists V\subseteq R^m$ open such that $\vec p \in V$, $M\cap V$ is the graph of a $C^1$ function
						- At this point $\vec p$ , the area is smooth and is n-dimensional
				- Tangent space↔Let $M\subseteq R^n$ be a smooth manifold and pick $\vec p \in M$. The tangent space of $M$ at $\vec p$$$ is $T_M(\vec p)=\{\vec v \in R^n:$ there exists a $C^1$ map $\gamma :(-1,1)\to M$ such that $\gamma(0)=\vec p$ and $\gamma^1(0)=\vec v\}$$$
					- $\gamma:(-1,1)\to M$ is a "curve" on $M$. $\gamma(t)$ traces a smooth path $C^1$ along $M$
					- All points where $\gamma$ passes through $\vec p$? Now take the instantaneous velocity vector $\vec v$ to get your set

					- [Equality for Animals?](https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1979----.htm)
						- Comparison to how slavery was treated as normal
						- We are used to regarding the oppression of blacks and women as among the most important moral and political issues facing the world today. These are serious matters, worthy of the time and energy of any concerned person. But animals? Surely the welfare of animals is in a different category altogether, a matter for old ladies in tennis shoes to worry about. How can anyone waste their time on equality for animals when so many humans are denied real equality?
						- This attitude reflects a popular prejudice against taking the interests of animals seriously - a prejudice no better founded than the prejudice of white slaveowners against taking the interests of blacks seriously. It is easy for us to criticize the prejudices of our grandfathers, from which our fathers freed themselves. It is more difficult to distance ourselves from our own beliefs, so that we can dispassionately search for prejudices among them. What is needed now is a willingness to follow the arguments where they lead, without a prior assumption that the issue is not worth attending to.
						- Would experimenters be prepared to perform their experiments on orphaned humans with severe and irreversible brain damage if that were the only way to save thousands? ( I say 'orphaned' in order to avoid the complication of the feelings of the human parents.) If experimenters are not prepared to use orphaned humans with severe and irreversible brain damage, their readiness to use nonhuman animals seems to discriminate on the basis of species alone, since apes, monkeys, dogs, cats and even mice and rats are more intelligent, more aware of what is happening to them, more sensitive to pain, and so on, than many brain-damaged humans barely surviving in hospital wards and other institutions. There seems to be no morally relevant characteristic
						- Capacity for suffering
							- If I give a horse a hard slap across its rump with my open hand, the horse may start, but it presumably feels little pain. Its skin is thick enough to protect it against a mere slap. If I slap a baby in the same way, however, the baby will cry and presumably does feel pain, for its skin is more sensitive. So it is worse to slap a baby than a horse, if both slaps are administered with equal force. But there must be some kind of blow - I don't know exactly what it would be, but perhaps a blow with a heavy stick - that would cause the horse as much pain as we cause a baby by slapping it with our hand. That is what I mean by 'the same amount of pain' and if we consider it wrong to inflict that much pain on a baby for no good reason then we must, unless we are speciesists, consider it equally wrong to inflict the same amount of pain on a horse for no good reason.
						- Benjamin Franklin Objection
							- 'Well', Franklin said to himself, 'if you eat one another, I don't see why we may not eat you'
							- objections to the Ben Franklin Objection ↓
								- Most animals that kill for food would not be able to survive if they did not, whereas we have no need to eat animal flesh.
								- It is odd that humans should, when it suits them, use an argument that implies we ought to look to animals for moral guidance.

					- Discussion
						- `Pain is suffering, suffering is optional.`
						- Decreasing demand is good but may not necessarily have the desired effect on supply
							- Halving demands doesn't necessarily result in twice as much space per animal, but the same amount and half the size of factories
							- The optimal strategy is not to only decrease the demand of factory farmed meat (which may have an unintended consequence on supply) but to increase the demand of ethically treated meat (which guarantees an intended consequence on supply)
						- Chicken sexers
						- Domestic sheep don't stop growing wool. Suppose we banned everything; would they all die off?
						- The ideal outcome is coexistence that is mutually beneficial to both of us, like dogs
						- Is it an evolutionary win to be factory farmed?
							- There are more chickens now than have ever been before
							- If we could help create them, feed them, and give them painless deaths, it could be great
							- If there is a way to reduce suffering in transit from beginning to end, that sounds like an optimal strategy

						- "Where's the dragon?" you ask.
						- "Oh, she's right here," I reply, waving vaguely.  "I neglected to mention that she's an invisible dragon."
						- You propose spreading flour on the floor of the garage to capture the dragon's footprints.
						- "Good idea," I say, "but this dragon floats in the air."
						- Then you'll use an infrared sensor to detect the invisible fire.
						- "Good idea, but the invisible fire is also heatless."
						- You'll spray-paint the dragon and make her visible.
						- "Good idea, but she's an incorporeal dragon and the paint won't stick."  And so on.  I counter every physical test you propose with a special explanation of why it won't work.
						- Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all?  If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists?  ^^Your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true.^^

						- The difference between 2 and 3 is much much bigger than―1 and 2 (even though most people would believe the opposite)
					- Are we living in the most influential time in human history?

					- `Are we trying to maximize happiness or minimize suffering?`
						- The utilitarian argument is yes, the other one is no
						- Most religions have at a central tenet that life is suffering
						- If climate change is inevitable, should we bring more people in if they might not live? -More chance that some people live. If 10% survive, then more likely to keep human existence in place
							- Would you kill Baby Hitler? One person can cause immense suffering, but can also cause immense happiness
					- Anti-natalism―Unborn babies / Is it wrong to bring someone into existence if their life is complete suffering
						- The paradox of utilitarianism is why should we have the authority to prevent suffering when suffering is in fact subjective, and we are incapable of measuring the potential suffering an organism will endure. Whereas the measurement of happiness does not need to be exact in order for it to be worth it

				- The Boulder City Council is planning a public meeting to discuss how to manage and develop a new parcel of open space land that the City of Boulder recently acquired. This is an important public issue and many people have strong opinions about what to do--or not do--with the land. The City Council wants citizen input, but there are so many people interested in this issue that it will be impossible to involve everyone at a public meeting. So the City Council creates a "citizen's input panel" made up of ten Boulder residents who will gather input from the entire community and represent these interests to the City Council in a report to be presented at the upcoming public meeting.

					- examples ↓
						- Fitness and Strength Training: The “beginner gains” come quickly at first, but then it becomes more difficult to get stronger each week.
						- Literacy: Children and young students make massive leaps as they learn how to read. Meanwhile, college students and well-educated adults have to put in a focused effort to expand their vocabulary beyond commonly used words.
						- Language proficiency: Learning how to speak even a rudimentary level of a new language opens up a whole new world. However, there are only meager gains left for fluent speakers to discover.
						- Weight Loss: It may be relatively easy to shed five pounds within a week or two, but then the progress slows. Each successive pound of fat loss is more stubborn than the last.
						- Musical skill: Improvements come quickly for a novice guitar player. Improvements come very slowly for a concert pianist.
				- Type 2: Exponential Growth Curve

					- examples ↓
						- Investments and wealth: Thanks to the power of compound interest, your retirement savings start out as a small treasure in the early years, but balloon in size during the final decade or two of savings.
						- Email subscribers and website traffic: New websites receive just a trickle of traffic here and there, but as the weeks and months roll on those trickles can build into a raging river of visitors and subscribers.
						- Entrepreneurship and business growth: The assets that you build for your business stack on top of one another and revenue compounds throughout the life of a successful business.
						- Social media followers: When you only have 100 followers, getting another 100 followers may take six months. Once you have 1,000 followers, however, getting the next 100 may only take one month. Once you have 100,000 followers, getting another 100 probably takes one day. Your growth rate snowballs.

			- That difference — asking good questions — made me become a scientist.”
		- Results vs. Lifestyle
			- "In the long-run, the people who succeed are the ones who want to live the lifestyle that precedes the results.
			- Stop asking, "What results do I want to have?"

			- It's common to want results. It's rare to want the lifestyle."

		- Vietnam Story
			- It wasn't long before one American in the truck said, "This place stinks." Another said, "These people live just like animals." Finally, a young air force man said, "Yeah, they got nothin' to live for; they may as well be dead."
			- What could you say? It seemed true enough.
			- But just then, an old sergeant in the truck spoke up. He was the quiet type who never said much. In fact, except for his uniform, he kind of reminded you of one of the tough men in the village. He looked at the young airman and said, "You think they got nothin' to live for, do you? Well, if you are so sure, why don't you just take my knife, jump down off the back of this truck, and go try to kill one of them?"
			- There was dead silence in the truck. . . .
			- The sergeant went on to say, "I don't know either why they value their lives so much. Maybe it's those snotty nosed kids, or the women in the pantaloons. But whatever it is, they care about their lives and the lives of their loved ones, same as we Americans do. And if we don't stop talking bad about
			- them, they will kick us out of this country!"
			- [A soldier] asked him what we Americans, with all our wealth, could do to prove our respect for the peasants' human equality despite their destitution. The sergeant answered easily, "You got to be brave enough to jump off the back of this truck, knee deep in the mud and sheep dung. You got to have the courage to walk through this village with a smile on your face. And when you see the smelliest, scariest looking peasant, you got to be able to look him in the face and let him know, just with your eyes, that you know he is a man who hurts like you do, and hopes like you do, and wants for his kids just like we all do. It is that way or we lose."
			- The code of the Ethical Warrior, even as an aspiration, shows that the American armed forces have come a long way from a time when its soldiers referred to Vietnamese peasants as gooks, slopes, and slants and when the military was slow to investigate atrocities against civilians such as the massacre at My Lai. As former Marine captain Jack Hoban, who helped to implement the Ethical Warrior program, wrote to me, "When I first joined the Marines in the 1970s it was 'Kill, kill, kill.' The probability that there would have been an honor code that trained marines to be 'protectors of all others — including the enemy, if possible' would have been o percent."
- I’ve always found it simple to make things complicated, but for me, writing is the opposite: it is the translation of the intangible to the tangible. My thoughts have had time over the years to become incredibly grand and complex, but that means I must expand my ability to condense these ideas into tiny words.
