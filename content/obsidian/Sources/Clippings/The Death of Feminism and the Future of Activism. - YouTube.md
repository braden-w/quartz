## Cringe
- A lot of [[Feminism]] is considered [[Cringe]].
- GIrl Boss led to cringe, out-of-touchedness, and essentially
- [[Defamation]] trials are used to silence a lot of women

## Judgement
- Sorority has evolved to mean peace, acceptance, inclusivity
- [[Choice Feminism]], which is feminism focused on [[Free Will]]
	- If you want to be a mom that's okay
	- If you want to have an OnlyFans, that's also okay
	- Just be politically conscious
- [[Why Choice Feminism Led to the Decline of Feminism]]
- [[Is the Ability to Choose Really Liberating?]]
	- [[Choice Feminism]] actually is Anti-Feminism and Anti-Women
