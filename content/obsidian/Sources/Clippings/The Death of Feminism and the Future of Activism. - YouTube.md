# The Death of Feminism and the Future of Activism. - YouTube

## Cringe
- A lot of [[Feminism]] is considered [[Cringe]].
- GIrl Boss led to cringe, out-of-touchedness, and essentially
- [[Defamation]] trials are used to silence a lot of women

## Judgement
- Sorority has evolved to mean peace, acceptance, inclusivity
- [[Choice Feminism]], which is feminism focused on [[Free Will]]
	- If you want to be a mom that's okay
	- If you want to have an OnlyFans, that's also okay
	- Just be politically conscious
- [[Why Choice Feminism Led to the Decline of Feminism]]
- [[Is the Ability to Choose Really Liberating?]]
	- [[Choice Feminism]] actually is Anti-Feminism and Anti-Women

> the part that really resonated with me was “choice feminism” as actually a tool to cop out on giving an actual opinion. honestly i feel i am guilty of this sometimes, my political opinions are not really well supported and often i am trying to choose the path where more people can be happy. i still think you can still be fulfilled as a stay at home mom/wife (or at least i hope, bc i want to believe you’ll be happy with life decisions you make, but i know that might not be realistic). also as a rebuttal to her lived experience hearing a bunch of wives complaining about their husbands - people can also complain about their career extensively too (but ofc her experience is very valid, and i’ve heard people like this too). I guess you can complain or love anything that consumes a big part of your life.

> I was raised surrounded by choice feminism and this now put me in a state of confusion and loneliness as i can't criticize western women for how they dress or empower themselves but in the same time things are getting worst here and we feel abandoned and silenced, we can't talk about systematic oppression in a clear language anymore because look a white girl in USA chose to (insert any violent practice against women) by her own free will

## Conclusion
- Do not get into competition of who is feminist enough. It is elitist and discounts people who do not have materil means to leave
