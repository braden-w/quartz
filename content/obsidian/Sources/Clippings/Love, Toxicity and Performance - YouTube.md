	- The culture of sexuality, consensuality, is very different from historic and cultural references
- In France, nonconsensuality is conflated as acts of passion
- Men are called "seducers" when they are often actually assaulters and rapists
	- Women are thought to be the most romantic involved in relationships
- [[True Consent is About Asking Throughout]]
- [[There is an anti-American Wave Throughout France]]
	- [[MeToo Movement]] is considered a challenge to French romance
	- Hijab is seen as anti-secularism
