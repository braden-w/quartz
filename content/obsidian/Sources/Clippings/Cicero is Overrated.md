# Cicero is Overrated
Cicero is frequently presented as the voice of reason, a common sense man of the people, but that view requires a modern take on his words. In context Cicero worked the "swing votes" center of the aisle, frequently offering compromise without offering solutions to problems, a political mercenary. This frequently left Cicero in the role of an eloquent defender of the corruption that was at the heart of all the problems of his day. Corruption in Rome had entrenched the elite into positions of power only military force could challenge, and they used that power to enrich themselves and attack their rivals without concern for the good of Rome. Reform was needed and because it had no honest champion the reform platform was seized by Caesar who just used reform as an excuse to change who the corruption benefitted. This is my view of what happened to Rome, and I see it play out time and again in history. If corruption can be checked a nation thrives for as long as corruption remains checked. Idealism and traditions are insufficient to chart a nation's course to prosperity. Corruption even brings short term gains, and so has defenders from those outside of the circle of corrupt, but corruption is the poison of nations.
