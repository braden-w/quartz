# I want to remember what I’ve learned, and I want to forget everything else
> Yet, this year, as I looked back, I had a stunning realization. It’s not my notes. It’s my approach. I’m taking notes to _remember_ when I should take notes to _forget_.

Remember "the sunshine of the spotless mind." Just as important as creating good [[Evergreen notes]] is for us to quickly **forget** and discard our ephemeral notes.

Write your notes for future you

It's also imkportant to keep in mind that [[Evergreen notes are good for "frontier work"]]
>
> So you asked yourself the question: in five years, why do you reference your notes? What do you want to find, and how do you want to find and use the information?
>
> In the future, I want to refer to my evergreen notes and pull out a POV, approach, or checklist for a thing I'm working on with my team, so we can deliver better work faster. I don’t want memories of what happened. Instead of notes about meetings and books, I want evergreen notes about what I know and think.
>
> What notes won’t you refer to? Me, I won't refer back to notes from a book on workshops. But I will reference _my approach_ to planning workshops. The notes you want to refer to in 5 years? Those are the notes you start now and let them grow over time.
>
> Luckily, the move to evergreen notes doesn’t require new systems or apps. It means you start with the notes you’re taking right now, this week, and move evergreen info into evergreen notes, so you can delete the digital marginalia. It also doesn't add much effort. Evergreen notes are incremental. In the example I posted, [“Stories drive change”](https://www.agux.co/s/Stories-drive-change-in-people-in-three-ways.pdf), I’ve revisited that note several times over the past month as I learned something new.

> When you take notes on things like books or articles or meetings, you probably  won’t refer to them in the future. And when you do, each individual note is separated from similar information in other notes. You need ephemeral notes while they're relevant, during the project or while reading the book. After that, they should fade from memory, so you can focus on more evergreen knowledge. If those notes contain evergreen ideas, move those ideas from the ephemeral note and into an evergreen note.
