# Why Doesn't Modern Healthcare Protocol Include Yearly Full-body CAT, MRI, or PET Scans to Really See What COULD Be Wrong with Ppl? - Askscience
1. Cost. The equipment and personnel needed to conduct such regular scans is prohibitive. A lot of people are talking about the machines, but the radiologists trained to read these scans are highly paid professionals.
2. Time. To conduct full-body scans of every type would be prohibitive. The scans you mentioned aren't like X-rays; they're not instantaneous. They take time to conduct properly.
3. Lack of personnel. We would need a massive influx of both techs to conduct the scans and radiologists to read them to handle the number of scans you're suggesting, and it would take decades to ramp up to a point where we have enough of them to handle the kind of volume this would be introducing. Both the techs and radiologists require years of specialized training.
4. Space. MRI/CAT/PET machines aren't small. If you needed enough of them to conduct these yearly scans, you either need to get rid of something in hospitals/labs currently, or create entirely new spaces to house them. This again adds to cost.
5. It's more likely to result in false positives and invasive exploratory procedures than real positives. Scans aren't always binary i.e. that's cancer/that's not. Many times there are areas that require further exploration. You might have to do more imaging focused on a single area, or a biopsy or other test.

In short, the chance that it might catch something isn't worth the cost in money/time/false positives. Unfortunately for your friend, the best indicators we have right now are symptoms, family history, and screening tests based on demographics.

Hopefully in the future, some or all of these barriers will be removed, and something like what you're suggesting will be possible rather than prohibitive.
