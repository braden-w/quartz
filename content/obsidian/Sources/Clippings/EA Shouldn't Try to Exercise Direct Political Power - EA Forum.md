# EA Shouldn't Try to Exercise Direct Political Power - EA Forum
This section on the implausibility of EA getting Republican buy-in and the associated backlash interesting:
> A hypothetical EA political movement would not be politically neutral. EA’s, if elected to congress, would presumably vote on every bill, not just the negligible number that EA itself prioritizes. [Only about 3% of EA's identify as right wingers](https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/eas2019-community-demographics-characteristics). Almost all EA’s live in congressional districts where you would need to be a Democrat in order to win. There is no chance of EA candidates controlling a majority, or even a significant fraction, of congressional seats by themselves. The *concrete outcome* of Effective Altruism exercising direct political power would be for EA to become a faction of the Democratic party.

## Andrew Doris' Response
> Some of the comments did a good job responding. To your quote, I don't think it's at all implausible that we'd get Republican buy in, for several reasons. First, OP underestimates the strategic sophistication of the people who are doing this, who have very much considered the risks s/he describes. The left-skew in the overall EA population does not require a proportional skew (neither by actual ideology nor by declared party affiliation) among EA political candidates. And it certainly does not require proportionality in EA funding to those candidates. For example, if it were even higher EV to try to get Republican EAs elected (perhaps for some of the reasons OP mentioned) those throwing money around may be willing to make funding decisions accordingly. Quite a few EAs are running as Republicans, and I actually think it's at least as likely they make it to Congress as the Democrats.Second, while I may be biased from hanging out with disproportionately left-leaning young college students in a policy program, I actually suspect the fiercest and most reputationally dangerous backlash EA will face from getting involved in politics will come from the progressive left, rather than from Republicans. Republicans have fewer qualms with money in politics on principle, as well as with tech or crypto billionaires in particular. They'll sympathize with the concern for efficiency and economic growth we discussed in that other thread. They have less power to set narratives in the mainstream media, outside Fox News. And few EA issues (except maybe veganism/animal rights) strike me as vulnerable to "red team" cultural attacks. More of the EA critques I've read have come from the left than from the right.So I do share the worry that EA may expose itself to reputational fallout that ultimately inhibits its long-term effectiveness from its political associations, but don't think this will be as politically one-sided as OP implies.
