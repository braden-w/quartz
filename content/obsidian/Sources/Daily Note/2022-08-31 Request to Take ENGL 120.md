# 2022-08-31 Request to Take ENGL 120
Dear Professor Perkins,

I'm a 2024 EP&E major who did not have a chance to take ENGL 120 in my first year. I recently completed the Yale in London program and after taking an English Class with Adam Sexton, would like to take more English Classes. This is the class that best accommodates my schedule. Thank you!

Best,
Braden
