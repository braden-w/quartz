Did MLSS meet your expectations? *

It exceeded by expectations

How enjoyable did you find MLSS? *

Enjoyable

How likely would you be to recommend MLSS to a friend? *

Assume in this question that MLSS happens next summer and that you have a friend who has similar experience, interests, and other opportunities to the ones you did when you applied to MLSS.

- I have already recommended MLSS to a friend

- 90%+ chance

- 50-90% chance

- 10-50% chance

- <10% chance

Why did you choose to do MLSS? *

Check all that apply.

- I wanted to learn machine learning and deep learning

- I specifically wanted to learn ML Safety

- I wanted to get the stipend

Would you have done MLSS without the stipend? *

- Yes

- No, because I needed to earn money somehow this summer

- No, my main motivation for doing MLSS was the stipend

Approximately how much time did you spend on MLSS, weekly? *

Answer this question overall/on average rather than for a particular week.

- 0-10 hours

- 10-20 hours

- 20-30 hours

- 30-40 hours

- 40-50 hours

- 50+ hours

Do you have any thoughts on the size of the stipend?

- It was probably too high

- It was about the right amount

- It was probably too low

Clear selection

Did your participation in MLSS change your views on any of the following?

Check all that apply

- Made me think AI safety was a more important problem

- Made me think AI safety was a less important problem

- Made me think I'm a good fit for working in AI safety

- Made me think I'm not a good fit for working in AI safety

Please elaborate on how your participation in MLSS changed your view on anything.

Over the next year, how likely are you to actively take steps towards exploring a career in AI safety? *

This could mean applying for a research position with the intention of doing AI safety, applying for a job, taking classes with the specific intention to use them for AI safety, etc.

- I already work in AI safety

- I am already actively trying to do this.

- 90%+ chance

- 50-90% chance

- 10-50% chance

- <10% chance

How has MLSS changed your certainty about your career plans? *

- It's made me more certain of my career plans

- It hasn't changed my certainty on my career plans much.

- It's made me less certain of my career plans

Which role(s), if any, are you interested in pursuing? *

- ML safety research

- ML safety engineering

- Theoretical/Conceptual AI safety research

- AI policy

- AI safety communications

- non-safety ML research

- none of these

In the next century, what do you think is the approximate likelihood of existential risk from AI? *

- 90%+

- 50-90%

- 10-50%

- 1-10%

- 0.01%-1%

- <0.01%

- Not sure

Were any of the TAs especially useful to you? If so, how?

Had a 1-1 office hours with Arush in which we discussed concepts of Neural Networks. It was very good in clarifying many of my understandings.

Do you have any suggestions for improvement for any of the TAs?

How good was the support you received from Thomas? *

- Good

Do you have any feedback/suggestions for improvement for Thomas?

How could MLSS be improved?

Spending more time on concepts in 1-1s. It felt like there was a grind to always do programming problems, but this made office hours much less cross-applicable between members and a lot of time was spent waiting for our turn.

What did you like the most about MLSS?

The papers and concepts I gained were extremely helpful. Although it should be noted that I was not looking for technical gains as much as other members were.
