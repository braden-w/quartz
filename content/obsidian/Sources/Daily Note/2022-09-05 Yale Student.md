# 2022-09-05 Yale Student Survey

## What Are Your Academic Interests? Why Did You Choose Your Major?
I am currently drawn to the intersection of policy and artificial intelligence. Currently, I am pursuing a major in Ethics, Politics, and Economics, with a second major in Computer Science and Psychology. Outside of school, I have taken several courses in Machine Learning and AI Safety. I love building things, and computers have been a way for me to express myself (at scale and on a budget). I also strongly believe that artificial intelligence will play an important role in the coming decades, having the capabilities to do immense good or harm, and it is crucial for it to go well. Combining the two, I hope to be able to apply both humanities and STEM skills in a career of high impact.

## Please Describe the Impact Financial Aid Has Had on Your Ability to Attend Yale and College Experience to Date. If Provided, Your Statement Will Be Shared with the Yale donor(s) to Whose Undergraduate Scholarship You Have Been Matched for the 2022â€“2023 Academic Year.
Financial aid has played an important role in my ability to attend, especially with my family's current financial situation. I am grateful for the support of Yale donors and hope to represent you well!

## Have You Found a Mentor Here at Yale? How Have They Inspired or Influenced You?
Yes, primarily in the form of many other students. It's nice to bounce ideas with other people my age about classes, career plans, and just general life thoughts, especially over a meal. Other professors have been extremely generous with their time, talking many hours after class with me.

## What Has Been Your Favorite Activity and Why? Have You Taken a Leadership Role? How Has Participating Affected Your Yale Experience?
I am drawn to the concept of doing the most good and Yale Effective Altruism. There, I participated in numerous fellowships and took on leadership roles spanning across website creation, event logistics, and management. The club is a fantastic environment for students to think critically, socialize, and find career resources in careers of high impact. I've found members to be deep thinkers and especially fun to talk with, as well as the most wholesome people I've met at Yale. It profoundly affected my Yale experience and career choice.

## What Career Do You See for Yourself Down the Road?
I can imagine myself in a career in software engineering, policy with a focus on artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence research, or some form of entrepreneurship. Anything that can allow me to build things and helps lots of people!

## What is Your Favorite Spot on Campus and Why?
Besides Cross Campus, I really love the Zoo, on the third floor of Watson Hall. It's a really nice spot for computer science students that features enormous 32-inch monitors (4K, UHD). It's air conditioned and open 24/7, which makes it ideal to study with my friends.
