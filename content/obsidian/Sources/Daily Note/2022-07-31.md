It comes across as it's more important to be accurate than to listen to someone else's feelings and validate their emotion at hand.

And that's rude.

If we are in a science setting, and being accurate about the number of men who did x versus not, it would be valid to correct your coworker to say "not all men did x" because that might impact the research.

But if someone is upset and unhappy about something that has happened to them and they are venting by saying "all men suck!" listening to them and seeking to understand what they mean when you tell them "not all men?" or are you prizing being technically right over their actual need when it makes no difference to you in that moment?

A lot of this is about nuance and timing. 'Valid argument' implies that there's a back and forth. Butting into someone else's venting to impose a technicality on them... not so much. Being right is a good thing. Being right all the time by forcing yourself into a conversation that didn't need you to invade to correct one small statement when it's highkey unnecessary is borish and rude.

Edit, since lots of people are taking this to the nth degree because I didn't add any limits on it, which I should have done. That doesn't mean that you should let this stand forever. It doesn't mean you shouldn't point out the sexism, or racism, or whatever. But it means you should pick your time and consider the situation before you make this into a "you said a bad thing and I'm disappointed in you" moment. You should consider how close you are with the situation, the person, and whether your contribution will help or whether it will come across as pedantic and dismissive of the actual issue in an effort to be more right than the other person.

If someone is mad that they just got broken up with and they're losing their home and they're angry and crying about it to their friends and you're just a classmate with no emotional involvement - not a good time to turn this into a teachable moment and you're not benefitting anybody involved here. Save it for later, when the other side is calmer and more open to listening. If they're just complaining about a server who forgot a dish, that's a good time to bring it up and point it out in the moment.

This is where the nuance and the timing part comes in. Pick your moment, the way you convey this, and the actual take away you want them to have.
