- On my belief that I might have a comparative advantage in policy (four thoughts)
	1. Policy advocacy

	2. Acting as a funnel
	3. Be close to a key person such that when a key policy is in place
	4. Actual public elected office
- Pursue the above in both Congressional and Executive Office
- [[Philosophy Shit]] nobody wants to
- [[Intelligence is information processing]]
- [[Are clouds conscious?]]
	- There is no reason for consciousness to not emerge from structure or for it to be digital
	- AI should be able to extort you and create so much suffering in a virtual world to get what it wants
