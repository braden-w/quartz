# 2022-09-06 Email to Richard Yang
Dear Professor Yang,

Greetings and hope this email finds you well! My name is Braden Wong, a junior interested in majoring or getting a certificate in Computer Science.

I was wondering if, in your experience, a student’s choice to get the certificate over a full major has had a markedly negative impact on their career prospects.

I have recently gone through a critical rethinking of my major at Yale and although I have completed CPSC 201, 223, 323, and 365, am strongly considering getting a certificate to enable myself to take certain one-time courses in my final four semesters. However, given that I have done 323 and heard that almost everyone who does 323 ends up completing the major, I am curious if you believe I would be committing to a mistake.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration!

Best,

Braden Wong

Class of 2024
