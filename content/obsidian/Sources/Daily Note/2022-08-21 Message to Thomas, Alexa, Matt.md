# 2022-08-21 Message to Thomas, Alexa, Matt
Hello everyone, I was wondering if we may have a chat in coming weeks regarding next steps with me and YEA. I’ve talked with everyone here 1-1, and it would be nice to sync up—it seems like I have talked to everyone here about different things

The reason for this talk is to define next steps and clear misunderstandings so that I may effectively contribute to YEA. Since around mid-summer since talking with [@Matthew Burtell](https://yaleea.slack.com/team/UN2UW682E), I have felt that I have been placed in a weird interim where I have felt that my work in YEA is not welcomed, yet still needed to finish my responsibilities. Ideally, having a talk would remove this disjunction effect, and dispel uncertainties. There is definitely an irrational component, although it has been reinforced by hearing different things and different recommendations from each person here

There is no rush for this; we can have this discussion a week after the Bazaar, if this is more convenient. It can also be over a meal. My summer schedule has also cleared up, so zoom is also possible

Before this, [@Thomas Woodside](https://yaleea.slack.com/team/U0183QJDP34) could we have a 1-1 regarding big-picture and “what I am doing this for”? I have talked to the others more recently about this, and it could save us time if we had a 30-minute chat before this
