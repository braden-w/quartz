# 2022-08-22 Thank You Letter to Mr. Sylvia About Writing and Concision
Dear Mr. Sylvia,

I was a student in your 2019-2020 AP English Literature class. I just wanted to express my gratitude for you teaching me the importance of concision in writing.

I still remember my first essay’s feedback in your class—a D-, with red notes everywhere. You called it “a painful read." Although it was difficult, I am glad we critically examined my writing. It taught me to express myself clearly.

I still use the lessons you taught me in 12th grade, and I recall your anecdote about the Notre Dame students. Though it’s a poor metric, I haven’t flunked any papers yet, so I hope I am doing something right.

Thank you for your guidance and patience.

Sincerely,

Braden Wong
