For me, you know, when i go a to other places, living in balley or living in paris, or whatever, and i'm not driving. I'm walking or using a scooter. Different thing. When you get rid of that, you're like, oh my god. I didn't know that this was so much better. So there's, there's something in book that's called out night.

It's like we do a lot of painful things, and we just kind of assume that's the way it's supposed to be. Like, wha mcatonms, vehicles, wel all assume we're supposed to be driving, right? And it doesn't.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>You don't think of it as a paint right? Well, you you've habituated it away. Yes, you've habituate it. For me, you know, when i go a to other places, living in balley or living in paris, or whatever, and i'm not driving. I'm walking or using a scooter. What have you? Different thing. And you go, oh, my god. When you left that environment, because everyone else is driving all the time, you're like, that's what you do. And you find out there's other ways of living and there's freedom. When you get rid of that, you're like, oh my god. I didn't know that this was so much better. So there's, there's something in book that's called out night. I deemed it the virus of doubt. And what the virus of doubt is is, when there's pain and it's been habituated away, you use the right marketing messages to to bring people back to that initial experience they had, or the initial experiences they had of that pain. Doyou remember when the first time you did blow and it felt like this, right? And then you reawaken that habituated pain, and people idn it becomes visceral. And then you theare like, oh, yes, i hate that you go. Now i have the pain killer and the joy for you.</blockquote>

You can't fall back on any data or any previous history to kind of inform you of what's going on, right? And so if you look at most companies who are paralyzed and cannot make new innovations and new products, it's because they're trying to turn opinion base decisions into data driven decisions. "If you fail with some of them, you didn't get it right, you'd you then own them and fix them and move on," he says.

And so if you look at most companies who are paralyzed and cannot make new innovations and new products, it's because they're trying to turn and this is what i saw at phillips they're trying to turn opinion base decisions into data driven decisions so they don't lose their jobs. So if you look at management consulting, management consulting is all about in those opinion base decisions, giving em to someone else to turn into data that comes back to them and says, they can blame the management consultants when something goes wrong, as opposed to, it wasn't me, right? When you need to have to tell that story, you have to understand that, especial v one, you need to be able to a articulate those, those opinion based decisions, and you need to own them. And if you fail with some of them, you didn't get it right, you'd you then own them and fix them and move on, right? Version one of the yepod wasn't perfect. Version one of the iphone wasn't perfect. We got a lot of opinion based decisions wrong. But as you go through, because you got more data, ecause v two, you had data on those original opinions, and then you were able to then modulate off of that, right? And you'l still have new opinions, because those are differentiators that yo a we call differentiators tha things that, you know, move to move the product forward.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>love the idea of bringing some mental challenge and some desire to improve a skill while conditioning. That's not something that i've thought of before, and it's simply because i've overlooked it. But it makes sense. Because my sister, who's reasonably fit, i'm always trying to get her to do a bit more. She always asks me, what should i take? And i believe her in supplements for certain people in certain instances. But i keep telling her, you know, the behaviours are going to ande. Nutrition are ging to have the greatest outsize, possitive effect. And she loves things like um dance classe and things, or kick boxing, these counds of things, which so it make sense that if you can hook somebody on the conditioning aspect or the skill aspect, and can't trick them into doing more cardio, so to speak, that that's terrific. Also, the neuro scientist in me just has to say, forgive me a that any time you're engaging the ouow tha two sets of motor narons, the ones in your brain, the upper motor rons, and the ones in your spinal cord. Any time you're engaging those upper motor nerons, which are for deliberate, well controlled action, you're doing a great thing for your brain in terms of brain longevity. So i now i need to incorporate some actual skills in my training. Am going back to t training a bit. One of the most important things i learned from you over the years was that when training to increase muscle size, to really think not so much about moving weights, but more about challenging muscles. I also heard this from my friend ben ski, who was very well accomplished. He was a body builder. Now he's in other aspects of fitness. Teach his fitness, but don't move weights. Challenge muscles, unless you're trying o power lift or something of that sort, which i'm not immensely helpful. But the other thing that i learned from you, that i combined with that, was this idea that certain muscles will grow better and get stronger much more easily, maybe even will recover better, because of our ability to contract them really hard.</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
When training to increase muscle size, think not so much about moving weights, but more about challenging muscles. If you can flex your bicep to the point where it hurts a little bit, that's a pretty good indication that you're going to be able to stimulate that muscle well under load. And that's the feeling i should aim for t each repetition, maybe even throughout the repetition.

If you can, if you can flex your bicep to the point where it hurts a little bit, like, it almost feels like a cramp, or a cramp, or you can flex your calf to the point where it really cramps up a loab, it almost fels like its nodding up, that's a pretty good indication that you're going to be able to stimulate that muscle well, under load, if you're doing the movement properly. And that's the feeling i should aim for t each repetition, maybe even throughout the repetition. For me, this completely transformed my results.</blockquote>

And i was getting stronger and stronger. I've dedicated a portion of my research along in collaboration with another group to try and understand what's happening in these upper motor nrons in the brain that can engage the muscles even more.

Am, thank you. We'll wl put that in the show notes also. Um, o, i think recovery is key. We always hear about sleep. You grow when you sleep. And incidentally, your brain, you stimulate learning when you 're awake, obviously, but the reordering of neural connections happens in sleep. This is why sleep is the way to get smarter, provided you're also doing the learning part. This. Sleep is the way t stronger it you're also doing the training part. You've had some reall interest. You've put out interesting content over the years in terms of even sleep positionah, one of the major changes that i made to my sleep behavior is to not have the sheets tucked in at the end of the and i'll tell you, this had a profound impact on several things. First of all, my feet always been the bane of my existence. Broke them a bunch. Scape wording they and i noticed when i'd run, i'd get shin splint and. And then i started to notice that my feet sort of a, you're the p t, they're kind of floppy and the as if i was pointing my toes slightly all the time at rest, if i was um. And i realized that, based on listening to you ously, that my sheets were wrapped tight, not hotel tightght. Nothing in the hotel gare fedin. And i started on releasing the sheets at the end of the bed. And i also started doing some tibialis workm front shins work. Essentially changed everything. My back pain from running. My shin splints appeared. My posture improved, although my audience will tell me that it still needs improvemet. There always five or ten people that once sit up straight. I thought she had chair centar mail dress. Very nice chairs. Rigt, so i'm trying, by i'm trying there, am. But this is fascinating, right? Um, the position tha, one sleeps in. Um, i'd fortunately have never in shoulder issues. Knock on wood, but maybe yo could just talk, talk to ust a little bit about sleep and sleep position for sake of waking position and movement. This, i think, is a very unique and very powerful way to think about sleep.</blockquote>

So, like, you're going to want to have the of them tight. Wellim saying as you experience, you know, you're going to havethes this a prolonged plenreflection that's going to likely lead to shorter calves over time. A, because you're lacking all that length for long period of time that you could have if you just loosened up the sheets and allowed your feet to just, you know, hang out where they are now, the resting position of the ankle, as not indorse reflection, is going to be still in some planerfection, but not being driven down and pulled down into that position a and i think what happens actually, as people who get uncomfortable that way en in their sleep, will shift away from that by turning either on to their side of their stomachs. So there is definitely an impact of the body position in sleep, in figuring out the best way that you can still sleep, of course, and get your rest, but have a mindful eye towards what is doing to your body, and choose the one that's least embrace to your body is the way you should go.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Terrific.

What's been shown is that when, when the repair process, muscular repair, from, lets say, strength riting during the day, the repair process usually results in a muscle that is slightly shorter, rather than increased in length. You know, its isthat. It's, your muscles prefer to sort of yo ratchet their way down into that that contraction, and then you maintain that that that more comfortable length tension relationship. So when you're sleeping, it tends to you on the side of shorter rather than longer. When an ideall, we don't really want that. We want to maintain as much of that length, because with more length, we actually have more leverage, right? That muscle has more leverage to contract if it was all the way contracted. Yeu really can't ois weu know, generate much force in a muscle that's already maximumly contracted. So i think we, we want to do something that we whatever we can, whatever little weapons we have in our arsenal that could allow us to do this prior to sleep.</blockquote>

A, it's an important skill to learn too, whether you go back to rum or, you know, or even even jog, right? Just like more casual running, learning how to land is so important. One of the drills that people should try is, like, try to jump on your heels. So just stand up, pull your toes off the ground, and just jump from your heels and land on your heels. You'll feel it in your jaw. You'll ritly feel your jaw rattle when you land on your heels. There is no shock absorption capabilities through your heels. Meantime, a lot of people land on their heels a lot when when they run. And you're just, your body's not built to absorb the forces like the ball your foot could. It's really built as a spring.

But at the same time, at some point, that critical juncture when you're going to then step through and you need to be able to push off, the foot has to actually change in the mid foot itself to become a rigid lever, as they call it. You're going from a mobile adaptor to a rigid lever. That rigid lever literally locks up the mid tarsal joint to come solid so that you can push off it with leverage.

#### ‚ú® Summary
The only muscle group that actually externally rotates the shoulders can be the rotator cuff. Unless you are devoted to training through external rotation and exercises that are going to externaly rotate the shoulder, youare not training that function. But why this is so important, not just for weight training, but as it terms iposture in mechanicsdand not looking like a melted candle,. I am happy to talk about it, caus i love, i love the shoulder as a joy. Pts tend to fall in love with certain areas, and the shoulder s one of the cool areas for me.

It's not an exercise i tended you. But one thing that's apparent in all my colleagues and every child i see and every adult i see, is that almost everybody is in inward rotation now. Am, so folks think of you stit. I think i learn this from you also. If you stand up straight, and then you just point your thumbs out. Am, like a, like a thumb's up, but you're just pointed. Your hands are down your you point your thumbs straight out. Ideally they would go straight outmost people, the thumbs aen't be pointing toward one another, because most people are starting to look somewhere between a a, a non um human primate um and a melted candle um, you know, bent at the hips, et cetera, from too much sitting. We're all sitting. Were in inward rotation, but i learn from you that the upright road compromises some important aspects of our shoulder mechanics. And cabea a sort of dangerous movement in some ways. I'm sure there's a safe way for people to do it. But so i've always made it a point now, on the basis of this advice, to not do upright roas but in doing them before, but to really strive for a external rotation on things like bench tips, on, on a number of different things. Whenever i can, i try and go into external rotation, provided without looking like an idiot, walked round with my palms facing outward. Please tell us about internal external rotation. A, the upright is one aspect of that. But why this is so important, not just for weight training, but as it terms iposture in mechanicsdand not looking like a melted candle, or a partially melted candle. I</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>actually love. I am happy to talk about it, caus i love, i love the shoulder as a joy. Pts tend to fall in love with certain areas, and the shoulder s one of the cool areas for me. Tis like the foot is, but like the shoulder, has the most mobility in the body of any of any joint, but it's also got the least stability, right? There's always that trade off of mobility and stability. So your stability comes from, you know, anmuscle groups. And one of the ones that, the only muscle group that actually externally rotates the shoulders can be the rotator cuff, ok? And unless you are devoted to training through external rotation and exercises that are going to externaly rotate the shoulder, youare not training that function.</blockquote>

And it's so easy for us in everyday life, especially those that aren't training, to not ever really undergo any of those stresses that could be beneficial to counteracting what happens freely and naturally, which is internrotation. So when you think about the balance created just by nature and how we live our lives, inter rotation far far outweighs extern rotation. So you need to address it. And the reason why you need to address it is because you need to normalize those bio mechanics of the shoulder if you want their long term held. And one of the functions of the shoulder is to raise our arm up over our head.</blockquote>

You don't know, i am proud to say, you know, and i don't have the kind of geneic swelick. We don't have a lot of impressive athletes in our family tree or ithin there are always some fit individuals, some less fit individuals. But i really beieve i's about putting in the work consistently over time. And the more, the more often you can wake up not in pain, the better am. And so, you no, i think that being an external rotation as often as possible as good. This a good friend who's a a yoga teacher told me, this is also a problem with the yogis, you know, a lot o all the downward dog stuff. For those listening, a you can think of inward rotation as like thumbs down. Just think thumbs down inwaration. Isn't bad, but less thumbs down, more thumbs up. Is external rotationso for those just listening, maybe that gives a visual. The more exercise you can do in external rotation, the better it seems on average. Em, i'd love to chat with you just a a little bit more about bil mechanics, um and. And this is a personal thing that that, again, your contact really helps all. For me, one is, i thought i had lower back pain. Thought i had siatica so badly that on a few trips, i a worked trips years ago when i was doing a lot more international travel, i mean, it was hard to stand up sometimes. I mean, excruciating pain. I didn't want to take medication. I want do back surgery a in the end, turns out it wasn't back jury at all. And one of the things that helped fix it was this, just learning about this thing called the medial glute. And you had a video that said, fix back pain. And then you quite accurally state that some back pain isn't really about the back at all. And am and had me do an exercise, oror allowed me to try and exercise, where i lay on my side and i sendsle pointed my my toe down, the top, toe down, almost like pointing the toe down. And then would slowly lift the leg up while pointing the toe down.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Maybe i got itrector.

And then it came back again the afternoon. So i did it again in the afternoon. So this is something i did for three or four days and alone behold my back pane's gone. I handed this off to my father, because he, like me, has a slightly lower right shoulder. I think our gait is probably thrown off by this. Is pria genetic etor, who knows? He handed it off to somebody. You know, it turns that we don't suffer from back painnd, in fact, now i don't suffer from any pain, because i was doing this exercise, which i think is helping my my medial glut.

Thereare a lot of male and female, who think they have back pain when they don't actually have back pain. And the other thing is that is about a general question about byal mechanics, or statement about bya mechanics. I had a feeling that a lot of what people think is back pain, or knee pain, her neck pain, her head ache, or shoulder an is actually a the consequence something that's happening above or below that sight of pain. And ah, this is a whole landscape o stuff relayed to p t andn and recovery and pain management. But maybe you just educate us a bit on this and why this works? What is the medial glut? Why did it make my so called back pain disappear? And a, how</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>should people think about pain?

The hip is like the shoulder, right? The ankle is the wrist, the foot is the hand, like there, there they funk the knees, the elbow, their two hinge joints. They function that way well. With the shoulder, you've got that mobility that comes from having all that freedom of motion, but the stability is lacking. Well, the same thing with the hip. Like, you've got mobility, but if you don't fully stabilize it by training all the muscles of the hip, and if you don't strengthen the external rotation of the hip, then, you know, youe, you're going to have issues. I di not bile mechanically going to work the same way. If you think of the body as a series of bands pulling in different directions at different levels of tension, you know, you're being pulled into one direction or the other, just by the balance of tension, from one weak area to one dominantly tight area.

People with chronic ankle sprainers are almost always going to wind up having back pain, because the ankle sprain causes weakness and maladaptations in the ankle that then gets connected through the chain.

The area where it's torking, which is at the knee. So the stress are going to be felt there. Meanwhile, the problem is the foot, or the problem is the ankle. People that are chronic ankle sprainers are almost always going to wind up having back pain, because the ankle sprain causes weakness and maladaptations in the ankle that then gets connected through the chain. Because now, once i distort the ankle on the shin, now the knee is trying to maintain its ability to hinge smoothly, so it torks on the femur to do that, while the femer's now inside the hip joint pulling on the pelvis, and the pelvis is ot of whack. So it's realief. It's really as fascinating. Like, it's one of my favorite things about how the body works, is like how it interconnected it is, and how one little thing somewhere causes repercussion somewhere else. And the easiest way to find out what your problem is is to say, i know where my symtem is, but i got to find someone who can help me find the source somewhere else. Because it is going to be usually either above or below, mostly usually below, because it usually translat up the connectict chain. But usually it's going to be below where the real source is. Some people with low back pain usually have hip issues, weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues. It's almost always below. Am when you get into really high performance athletics, though, it almost works the other way, like where we have picchers who can't, i mean, i'm always fascinated by guys that have a, a tommy john issues, nein their elbow.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>things. I'm not excluding them, but i don't put and the portionsthat you would generally find, you know, my wife and i will go out and will go the restaurant sometimes, like, because we travel quite a bit. Are used to, at least with baseball too, there is a cheesecake factory everywhere you went. And i love cheesecake factory. But like, the way they structure meals is it's all rice on the bottom and ha little bit chicken on top. I mean, it's a plateful of rice that you wouldn't find me make a plate that way. I'm going to just devote that portion of the plate to the starchy carbohydrate. And so it gives me a little bit more responsibility in terms of portion control. Cause those are the foods a, again, probably younow, don't mean driven, that are most easily overeaten. I always asked the question, how it was the last time you ate ten chicken breasts at a meal, like you're getting sick of it after maybe two or three. But you could eat a whole hel of a lot of carbohydrate, starching carbohydrates, because t they're just so satisfying. And i think those triggers, as you said, they want more. Like that's what happens, right? You just keep even when you're feeling full, you want more. Ah, and that's the biggest danger to carbohydrate. So if you can develop some sort of discipline around them, a, then you can still enjoy them. If you can't develop that discipline a, for whatever reason, then maybe they do become something that you have to work yourself around or adopt. The differnt eting style. As i said, i'm never to the point where i'm not trying to be dogmatic in my approach. I'm always trying to say, this is how i do it, and i'm a believer in it, just like everyone else's believer in their method.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Today‚Äôs episode focuses on optimising your sleep. It‚Äôs designed for people who don‚Äôt have clinical insomnia but would like to fine-tune their sleep. Matt goes over five conventional tips, and five unconventional tips that may be new to you.¬† <br/> The first tip is regularity‚Äîgoing to bed and waking up at the same time every day. Your brain has its own master 24-hour clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which expects regularity.¬† <br/> Second is temperature‚Äîyour brain and body need to drop their temperature for you to fall and stay asleep, so the ambient temperature must be cold.¬† <br/> Third is darkness‚Äîwe need darkness to trigger the release of melatonin.¬† <br/> Fourth is to walk it out. If it‚Äôs been around 25 minutes, and you can‚Äôt fall asleep, get out of bed, relax in another room, and come back to bed later.¬† <br/> Finally, try to abstain from coffee from around noon and avoid drinking alcohol in the evening. <br/> Of the non-conventional tips, the first is this: if you‚Äôve had a bad night‚Äôs sleep,¬† DO NOTHING. Don t wake up any later. Don t drink excessive compensation caffeine. Don t nap. And don t go to bed any earlier the following night. That explains the reasons why. <br/> The second tip is to have a wind-down routine. Your biology needs to wind down so you can descend into good sleep at night, so we should all find our own wind-down routine. <br/> Third is to stay away from naps, especially after 1pm, which is a bit like snacking before your main meal.¬† <br/> The fourth tip is don‚Äôt count sheep. It doesn t work (in fact, it makes matters worse!) Instead, take yourself on a familiar mental walk. Doing this helps take your mind off itself and lets you fall asleep because you stop overthinking. <br/> And the ffinal unconventional tip is to remove or cover all clock faces in the bedroom.¬† <br/> Please note that Matt is not a medical doctor, and none of the content in this podcast should be considered medical advice in any way, shape, or form, nor prescriptive in any way. <br/> The good people at InsideTracker are one of the sponsors of this week s episode, and they are generously offering a special 25% off any one of their programs for anyone who uses the above link during the time window of this episode.

#### ‚ú® Summary
The fifth and final tip i have is to remove all clock faces from the bedroom. I think i would say particularly or exclusively if you're struggling with sleep. Because staring at a clock in the e of the night at three 25 a m is not going to do any favors for you being able to fall back asleep. And it's been scientifically proven, once again, by my wonderful colleague, doctor ellison harvey,. You see, berkeley. So they've overed that trick as well.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And what was all so great about her research is that they discovered a better trick, which is following, take yourself on a well known mental walk. So think about a walk that you commonly do in the forest, or a hike that you do, or a walk down on the beach. Goodness, i'm very envious if you can do that, if you're lucky enough to live by the beach. But just really pleasant walk that you do. Think about that, as long as it's something that you know well. And then start in really great, high fidelity detail. Think about leaving your front door, going down the steps, and then you're out, and then your stead of moving this direction. And then really take yourself peace meal on that walk. And in doing that, it really helps you take your mind off itself. You stop over thinking trying to sleep, because you are off on your wonderful mental walk, and then you fall asleep faster. And it is a proven trick that they've overed. The fifth and final tip i have is to remove all clock faces from the bedroom, especially if you're struggling with sleep.

But are people generally bad at predicting far future events, including thoughtful people who are trying reason hard to be right? If we look back at prominent futurist predictions, what's the actual track record? How bad is the situation? open philanthropys luk muelhauser has put in a fair amount of effort into researching it.

I've argued that the development of advanced dei could make this the most important century for humanity. A common reaction to this idea is one laid out by tyler cowan in a piece that i link to, where he says, how good we're, past thinkers, at predicting the future. Don't just select on those who are famous because they got some big things right now. This is a common reason people give for being sceptical about the most important century hypothesis, and often for scepticism about pretty much any attempt at futurism, trying to predict key event in the world a long time from now, or what i call steering, trying to help the world navigate key future events. The idea of the scepticism is something like, even if we can't identify a particular weakness in arguments about key future events, perhaps we should be sceptical of our own ability to say anything meaningful at all the long run future. Hence, perhaps we should forget about theories of the future and focus on reducing suffering to day. Generally, increasing humanity's capabilities and technologies, et cetera. But are people generally bad at predicting far future events, including thoughtful people who are trying reason hard to be right? If we look back at prominent futurist predictions, what's the actual track record? How bad is the situation? I've looked pretty far and wide for systematic answers to this question, and open philanthropys luk muelhauser, has put in a fair amount of effort into researching it. I link to a couple of his reports. So far, we haven't turned up a whole lot. The main observation is that it's hard to judge the track record of futurists. Luke discusses the difficulties in a piece that i link to, and an appendix to this piece that ill read goes through a bunch of bunch of things. Now, recently i worked with ar research to take another crack at this. I tryd to keep things simpler with past attempts.</blockquote>

It's the most important show in comedy. Because, first of all, it establishes stand up in a sense that, like for the open micre for the people that are starting it out, it establishes that the most important thing is to be funny, like this is what the art form is all about.

<blockquote>In the past few weeks alone, the Supreme Court has delivered a firestorm of conservative legal victories. States now have far less leeway to restrict gun permits. The right to abortion is no longer constitutionally protected. The Environmental Protection Agency has been kneecapped in its ability to regulate carbon emissions, and by extension, all executive branch agencies will see their power significantly diminished.<br/> But to focus only on this particular Supreme Court term is to miss the bigger picture: In the past few decades, conservative court majorities have dragged this country‚Äôs laws to the right on almost every issue imaginable. Shelby County v. Holder gutted the Voting Rights Act and opened the door for states to pass restrictive voting laws. Rucho v. Common Cause limited the court‚Äôs ability to curb partisan gerrymandering. Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission unleashed a torrent of campaign spending. Janus v. AFSCME Council 31 weakened unions. A whole slew of cases, including some decided on the shadow docket during the Covid-19 pandemic, undercut federal agencies‚Äô power to help govern in an era of congressional gridlock. And that‚Äôs only a partial list.<br/> Kate Shaw is a law professor at Cardozo School of Law, a co-host of the legal podcast Strict Scrutiny and a former clerk for Justice John Paul Stevens. In this episode, she walks me through the most significant Supreme Court cases over the past 20 years, from the court‚Äôs decision to hand George W. Bush the presidency in 2000, to the dismantling of the Voting Rights Act, to the assertion of an individual‚Äôs right to bear arms.<br/> Along the way, we discuss the right‚Äôs decades-long effort to transform American law from the bench, how Republican-appointed judges have consistently entrenched Republican political power, the interpretive bankruptcy of constitutional originalism, how the Warren Court radicalized the conservative legal movement, what might happen to decisions like Obergefell v. Hodges now that the court majority seems to be so comfortable throwing out precedent, what cases to watch in the Roberts Court‚Äôs next term, and more.<br/> Mentioned:<br/> ‚Äú After Citizens United: How Outside Spending Shapes American Democracy ‚Äù by Nour Abdul-Razzak, Carlo Prato and Stephane Wolton<br/> ‚Äú The Most Important Study in the Abortion Debate ‚Äù by Annie Lowrey<br/> Book recommendations:<br/> The Turnaway Study by Diana Greene Foster<br/> Torn Apart by Dorothy Roberts<br/> Who Decides? by Jeffrey S.

#### ‚ú® Summary
The Supreme Court ruled that unlimited independent campaign contributions do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of it. The decision was made by Justice Kennedy, who says he knows better than te no elof sight. This is bad punditry and i would be embarrassed to make that argument. But nevertheless, it is a crucial decision that is not, in any way that i can tell, truly illegal.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>want to say it's worse than your saying here. This patirla opinion. And if you listen to thi show, i think you'lve see in overtime that i don't have very much respect for the supreme court. And it's because of opinions like citizens united were i read them an realize they're doing what i do, just worse. They're just running crappy punditry. So you ere talking about kennedy's views there of whether corruption can be addressed. But kennedy goes further. He talks about whether or not corruption is present. He he makes as cor his inion, like an actual view, about whether or not political contributions of this kind will either create real corruption or the appearance of it. Because he agrees on some level that there is an interest in reducing corruption and the appearance of it. So he he writes, we now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. He goes on to say, the fact that speakers, by which he means here donors, may have influence over or access to elected officials, does not mean that these officials are corrupt. Then he goes on to say, the appear rence of influence or access furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy. And i don't understand how you can see that is anything but punditry. I mean, bad punditry. I would be embarrassed to make that argument. But nevertheless, it is a crucial decision that is not, in any way that i can tell, truly illegal decision. Much like john roberts decides racism isn't that bad any more, justice kennedy decides political corruption isn't that bad any more. And what is so weird about it to me is, if you would imagine that there would be anywhere in the world, in the law that you would obviously defer to elected politicians on what is going on here, it would be on the question of whether or not unlimited independent campaign contributions lead to corruption, or the appearance of corruption in political practice. And kennidy decides he knows better than te no elof sight.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Well,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>look, i think it's em you say it's a few, you know, of course it's this is, i think it the biggest miracle of the universe, is thet er. It is just a few pounds of mush in our skulls, and yet it's also our brains are the most complex ts in that we know of in the universe. So there's something profoundly beautiful and amazing about our brains. And i think that it's an incredibly, incredible, efficient machine. And an and its is, you know, phenomenon, basically. And i think that bil in a i, one of the reasons i want to build a i, and i've always wanted to, is i think by building an intelligent artir fact, like a i, and then comparing it to the human mind, a, that will help us unlock the uniqueness and true secrets of the mind that we've always wandered about since the dawn of history, like consciousness, dreaming, a creativity, a a emotions. What are all these things? Rightwi, wi, we've wondered about them since since the dawn of humanity. And i think one of the reasons, and you know, i love philosophy, and philosophy of mind, is we've found, i difficulties. There haven't been the tools for us to really, other than introspection, two fromvery clever people in history, very clever philosophers, to really investigate this scientifically. But now, suddenly we have a pelethro of tools. First, we have all the newer science tools, from u machine, single cell recording, all this stuff. But we also have the ability, computers and a i, to build or intelligence systems. So i think that er, you know, i think it is amazing what the human mind does. And er, and, and i'm kind of in awe of it, really. And er, and i think it's amazing that with our human minds we're able to build things like computers and and a even you now think and investigate about these questions. I think that's also testament the human mind.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Yes, the universe built the</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>human mind that now is building computers that help us understand both the universe and our own human mind, right? Its</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>lictly it. I mean, i think that's one we, one could say, we, we all, maybe we're the mechanism by which the universe is going to try and understand itself. Yes.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Ah, it's beautiful. So let's, let's go to the basic building blocks of biology.</blockquote>

Proteins themselves, i think, are magical and incredible. The average protein can fold in maybe ten to the power 300 different confirmations. In some cases there might be a misfunction so on, which leads to a lot of the disorders and stuff like that. it's a weird system that they've figured it out.

I mean, you know, maybe we should talk about the origins of life too. But proteins themselves, i think, are magical and incredible. A a, as i said, little little bionana machines and ar and, and actually, leventa, who is another scientist, a contemporary of amvinson a, he, he coined this, leventa, what became known as leventa's paradox, which is exactly what you're saying. He calculated roughly a prot an, average protein, which is maybe two thousand amino acids, a bases long. Is a is is can fold in maybe ten to the power 300 different confirmations. So thes ten to the power 300 different ways that protein could fold up. And yet, somehow, in nature, physics solves this, solves this in a matter of miller seconds. So proteins fold up in your body in, you know, sometimes in in fractions of a second. Sophysics is somehow solving that search problem. And</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>just to be clear, in many of these cases may be correctny fom wrong. There's often a unique way for the sequence to form itself, yes. So among that huge number of possibilities, yes, it figures out a way how to stable a in some cases there might be a misfunction so on, which leads to a lot of the disorders and stuff like that. But yes, most of the time it's a unique mapping. And that unique mapping is not obvious.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>No, exactly. I shoul see what the problem is, exactly. So there's a unique mapping, usually in healthy if it's healthy. And as you say, in as so, for example, outsimers one one, one conjecture is that it's because of a misfolder protein, a protein that falls in the wrong way.</blockquote>

Google engineer said language model exhibited sentiente so you believed there might be a responsibility to build systems that are not sentient. So what's your thought about this particular a system? Wi isa, have you ever met a language thats sentient? No, i practily kno. Now, what do you make of the case when you can feel that there are some element of sentience to the system? Yes, an interesting question, and alse a very fundamental one. I think at the moment, it's more f projection of the way our own minds work which is to see a a sort of purpose and direction in almost anything that we in our brains are trained to interpret.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So on that topic, just not as the sea of deep mind im just as a human being. When may ask you about this one particular anecdotal evidence of the google engineer who made a comment or a believed that there is some aspect of a language model, on the lambde language model, that exhibited sentiente so you said you believed there might be a responsibility to build systems that are not sentient. And this experience of a particular engineer, i think, i'd love to get you nal opinion on this kind of thing, but i think it will happen more and more and more, which a, not when engineers, but when when people out there that don't have an engineer background start interacting with increasingly intelligent systems. We anthropomorphise them, they they start to have deep impactfu a inter tions with us in a way that we miss them when they're gone. And we sure feel like there living entities, self aware entities, and maybe when we project sentience onto them. So what's your thought about this particular a system? Wi isa, have you ever met a language thats sentient? No, i practily kno. Now, what do you make of the case when you can feel that there are some element of sentience to the system?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yes, so this is, you know, an interesting question, and alse a very fundamental one. So the first thing to say is, i think that, er, none of the systems we have to day, i would say, even have one iota of a semblance of consciousness or sentimence. That's my personal feeling interacting with them every day. I think this way premature to be discussing what the engineer talked about, i preach. I think at the moment, it's more f projection of the way our own minds work, which is to see a a sort of purpose and direction in almost anything that we in our brains are trained to interpret, a a agency, basically, in things are even ann inanimate thing sometimes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On January 1, 2015, physicist Max Tegmark gave up something most of us love to do: complain about things without ever trying to fix them. <br/><br/>That ‚Äúput up or shut up‚Äù New Year‚Äôs resolution led to the first Puerto Rico conference and Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence ‚Äî milestones for researchers taking the safe development of highly-capable AI systems seriously. <br/><br/> Links to learn more, summary and full transcript. <br/><br/>Max's primary work has been cosmology research at MIT, but his energetic and freewheeling nature has led him into so many other projects that you would be forgiven for forgetting it. In the 2010s he wrote two best-selling books, Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality , and Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence , and in 2014 founded a non-profit, the Future of Life Institute, which works to reduce all sorts of threats to humanity's future including nuclear war, synthetic biology, and AI. <br/><br/>Max has complained about many other things over the years, from killer robots to the impact of social media algorithms on the news we consume. True to his 'put up or shut up' resolution, he and his team went on to produce a video on so-called ‚ÄòSlaughterbots‚Äô which attracted millions of views, and develop a website called 'Improve The News' to help readers separate facts from spin. <br/><br/>But given the stunning recent advances in capabilities ‚Äî from OpenAI‚Äôs DALL-E to DeepMind‚Äôs Gato ‚Äî AI itself remains top of his mind. <br/><br/>You can now give an AI system like GPT-3 the text: "I'm going to go to this mountain with the faces on it. What is the capital of the state to the east of the state that that's in?" And it gives the correct answer (Saint Paul, Minnesota) ‚Äî something most AI researchers would have said was impossible without fundamental breakthroughs just seven years ago. <br/><br/>So back at MIT, he now leads a research group dedicated to what he calls ‚Äúintelligible intelligence.‚Äù At the moment, AI systems are basically giant black boxes that magically do wildly impressive things. But for us to trust these systems, we need to understand them. <br/><br/>He says that training a black box that does something smart needs to just be stage one in a bigger process. Stage two is: ‚ÄúHow do we get the knowledge out and put it in a safer system?‚Äù <br/><br/>Today‚Äôs conversation starts off giving a broad overview of the key questions about artificial intelligence: What's the potential? What are the threats? How might this story play out? What should we be doing to prepare? <br/><br/>Rob and Max then move on to recent advances in capabilities and alignment, the mood we should have, and possible ways we might misunderstand the problem. <br/><br/>They then spend roughly the last third talking about Max's current big passion: improving the news we consume ‚Äî where Rob has a few reservations. <br/><br/>They also cover: <br/><br/>‚Ä¢ Whether we could understand what superintelligent systems were doing <br/>‚Ä¢ The value of encouraging people to think about the positive future they want <br/>‚Ä¢ How to give machines goals <br/>‚Ä¢ Whether ‚ÄòBig Tech‚Äô is following the lead of ‚ÄòBig Tobacco‚Äô <br/>‚Ä¢ Whether we‚Äôre sleepwalking into disaster <br/>‚Ä¢ Whether people actually just want their biases confirmed <br/>‚Ä¢ Why Max is worried about government-backed fact-checking <br/>‚Ä¢ And much more <br/><br/> Get this episode by subscribing to our podcast on the world‚Äôs most pressing problems and how to solve them: type 80,000 Hours into your podcasting app. <br/><br/><br/> Producer: Keiran Harris <br/>Audio mastering: Ben Cordell <br/>Transcriptions: Katy Moore</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>We could solve all sorts of problems that our human intelligence has been stumped by so far. And if you get a bit more nirty about it, which i love to do as a physicist, then it's quite obvious that if we really succeed in figuring out what intelligence is, and how to build things that are as intelligent as aws of physics allow, you know, that we would shift from suddenly being limited, not by what we can figure out, to just being limited by the laws of physics. And you can get nerty on that and realize that it's just so many orders of magnitude more in all ways. If you ask how much compute per second get, or if you ask how how possible it is to go travel to other galaxies, or basic any actes you're excited about, we're nowhere near the limits that the laws of physics place the speed of light, that you can't be stuff like that. And the secret to unlocking this is through artificial intelligence. Now, so that's the upside. Basically, anything you would like to do which we haven't been smart enough to do yet, cure cancer, eliminate poverty, help people live exciting, inspiring lives, or for that matter, if you would like to help help life spread throughout our observe, much of our servable universe. Any of those things, artificial intelligence has a potential to give them to you. And moreover. You don't have to wait millions of years, like in the syphi novels. It's quite likely that, i believe, we could get this in our lifetime. So that's the upside. But we also know that every tool we have is a double edged sword, not just a sword.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>First of all, sociologically, spot on there. Rob people are really all over the place, even very educated people. And there are these two basic dimensions you outline first the question of, well, how soon and will this happen, and how far will it go? Where you'll have some people like my former m i t colleague, professor rodney brooks, who says it's not going to happen for 300 years, ther we'll even to human level, and a hundred % sure. And then you have other people, which aren't actually most people in the technical community now, who think tits can happen a lot sooner. And recent poles of ai researchers tend to predict that ao decades from now, we'll have a that can do basically all our human jobs, or cheaper than we can. That that's one axis where you can basicaly classify people from techno sceptics to think it's never going to work, to techno optimists. And then on the other axis, it's do they think this is going to suck, or going to be great? Where maybe it actually says more about peoples personality traits and whether than than anything scientific, really where they land on that. Some people tend to becone of hopeful and optimistic about everything. Some people are more prone to wishful thinking than others. If we take the first one, the question of what will actually happen, i think a very common misconception, specially among scientists, is that intelligence is something mysterious that can only exist inside of biological organisms like human beings and te if we've learned anything from physics, it's that the no, intelligence is about information processing. And it really doesn't ter whether the information is processed by a carbon atom, by carbon atoms in neurons in brains, in people, or by silican atoms in some g pu somewhere. It's the information processing itself that matters. It's this sub straight independent nature information processing t hat doesn't matter whether it's a mack or a pc you're running it on, or linnox box, or for that matter, what the cpu manufacture is, or even whether it's biological or silican base that matters. It's just the information processing that matters. That's really been the number one corps idea. I would say, that that's caused the tion at nai, that you can keep swabping up out your hardware and using the same alegarithms. Whence you once you accept that that you and i are blobs of corks and electrons that happen to be arranged in a way such that they can process information, well, it's pretty obvious that, unless you have weigh more hubrous than i do, you know that the we are not the most optimized cork blobs possible for information processing.

We've already alluded to a little, but another issue is, even if we tried to always do what was in your own personal best interest, yo, suppose someone had solved this, this multi scale alignment, ok, and set up the things so that if you just did what was in your interests for ala, your incentives, things would work out great for everyone. You might not be able to figure out actually, what's best for you, because the world is complicated. Whiht if you had sort of fictitious, infinitely powerful, super hyper computer, you can think through every possible action. And and what impact i would have if we don't have that. We are what, in machine learning nordspeak, is known as an agent of bounded rationality. We have a finite amount of neurons, a fininte amount of time to think, and we have to divide that between doing many different tasks. And because of that, we can be hacked. And we mean, we can often fail.

#### ‚ú® Summary
Something is going radically wrong in the world of american pretens. It started right around 20 12, 20 13 and it wasn't gradual. Nobody has come up with another explanation. The data is, of course, as everyone knows, correlation doesn't prove causation.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Ah, but it's two to three times more common now, or by 20 15, it had doubled. Between 20 ten and 20 15. It so something is going radically wrong in the world of american pretens. And whatw so as i've been studying it, i found, first of all, it's not just america. It's identical in canada and the u. K. Australian new zealand are very similar there, ust after a little delay. So whatever we're looking for here, but yet, it's not, it's not as clear in the germanic countries. In continental europe, it's little different. And we can get into that when we talk about childhood. But something's happening in many countries a that. And it started right around 20 12, 20 13. It wasn't gradual. A, it hit girls hardest, and it hit preteen girls the hardest. So what could it be? Nobody has come up with another explanation. Nobody. It wasn't the financial crisis, that wouldn't hit preteen girls the hardest. A, there is no other explanation. The complexity here. And the data is, of course, as everyone knows, correlation doesn't prove causation. The fact that television viewing was going up in the fifties and or in the sixties and seventies doesn't mean that that was the cause of the crime. So what i've done a, and this is work with jean twang, who wrote the book, igen is ah. Because i was challenged you know, one nigt. When gregg and i put out the book, the coddling themerican mind, some researchers challenged us and said, oh, you do't nowha. You're talking about, you know, the correlations between social media use and and mental health. They exist, but they're tiny. It's its no like e correlation coefficient of point o three, or ou kno bata of point o five, ina, tiny little things.</blockquote>

You focus on bullying before. That's one of five or seven different avenues of harm. The main one, i think, which does in the girls, is not being bullied a it's living a life where you're thinking all the time about posting. Because once a girl starts posting, so it's bad enough that theyre scrolling throughand thiss, everyone comments on this. You're scrolling through whan everyone's life looks batter than yours because its fake. And all that you see are the ones the algorithm picked that were the night. Anyway, so the scrolling, i think, is bad for the girls. But i'm beginning to see, i can't prove this, bat i'm beginning to see, from talking to girls, from seeing how it's used, is once you start posting, that takes over your mind. And now you're basicall. You're no longer present a because even if you're only spending five or six hours a day on instagram, you're always thinking about it.</blockquote>

And so this combination of weakness and grandeur, right, of not being as strong as he west, but aspiring to be as great or greater than the west.

The Russian foreign minister has been giving interviews s in the press. He's got this conspiratorial theory that the west has been on a forever campaign to destroy russia, just like it destroyed the soviet union. Everything the west does is meant to dismember russia, and that russia is fighting an existential battle against the west. Never mind that bill clinton's administration, following george bush, sent loads of money, western taxpayer money, to Russia. So how was that a plot? And lixs.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And patrushef has been giving interviews s in the press. You probably saw the interview with nisavisimaia gazieta not that long ago. He writes also his own blog, like interventions in the public sphere using the few channels that are left. And what's interesting about patrushefandand this could well reflect similar thinking to putens, which is why bringing this up, is that he's got this conspiratorial theory that the west has been on a forever campaign to destroy russia, just like it destroyed the soviet union, and that everything the west does is meant to dismember russia, and that russia is fighting an existential battle against the west. And so, for example, the c i a and american government wanted to bring down the soviet union. Never mind that the bush administration, the first bush, the father, was trying desperately to hold the soviet union together because they were afraid of the chaos that might ensue and the nooks that might get loose as a result of a soviet collapsed. And it wasn'ttill the very last moment where bush decided, his administration decided to back those republican leaders who were breaking away from mihail gorbichof and the soviet union. Right? So never mind the empirics of it. Never mind that bill clinton's administration, following george bush, sent loads of money, western taxpayer money, to russia. We don't know exactly how much, because it came from different sources. People talk about how there was no marthal plan. It was tens of billions of dollars from various sources, from the i m f and other sources. And lixs. It disappeared. It's gone. Just like the german money that went to gorbatrov for unification red even before the soviet collapse, the money disappeared, but the west sent the money. So how was that a plot?</blockquote>

The woman was wearing lipstick, or the woman was applying for nato membership and just had to be raped thers. I mean, didn't want a raper, but was compelled because of what she was doing and what she looked like and and the clothes she was wearing, and the alliances that she was under. International law signed by moscow. All the treaties that sovereign countries get to choose whatever alliance they belong to, a treaties that the u. N charter, signed by russia, the soviet union, the 19 75 helsinki agreement, signed by the soviet union. The 19 90 charter of paris for new europe, signed by the soviet uion, the 19 97 nato russia founding act, signed by the russian government, the post soviet russia. All of those documents signed by either the soviet regime or the russian regime, which is the legally recognized, international, inheritor right successor of the soviet state. All those agreements are still in force, and all of them say that countries are sovereign and can freely choose their foreign policy and what alliances they want to join. Let's even go farther than that. I mean, you don't have to go farther than that. But let's go farther than that. Lex is an autocratic, repressive regime that invades its neighbors in the name of its own security. Something new in russian history. Did we not see this before? Is this? Does this not pre date nato expansion? Does this not predate the existence of nato? Would oliver stone sit here in this chair and say to you, you know, they had to impose serftom in the seventeenth century because nato expanded. They had no choice.

And they resent the fact that the west doesn't acknowledge them as one of those great powers. And they resent that the west is more powerful. People talk about how poton doesn't understand the world, and that he gets really bad information. Lex, if you're sitting there in that kremlin and you're trying to conduct business in the world, and you're getting reports from your finance minister or your central bank governor your whole economy, everything that matters, somehow all your trade is denominated in dollars and uros, do you have any illusions about who controls the international financial system? I don't think so. Lex, you're looking over your industrial plan for the next year, and you're looking over how many tanks you're going to get, and how many cruis missiles you're going to get, and how many submarines you're going to get and and filling the blank. And you know what? Its right there in the paper work. Where the component parts come from, where the soft work comes from, comes from the west. Lex, your whole military industrial complex is dependent on high end western technology. And then, and let's, and let's say you're in bejing, not just in moscow, and you go to a meeting in your own neighborhood. You're the leader of china. You go to a meeting with other asian leaders. Do they all speak in chinese with you? No, lex, they don't speak chinese. You go to an international meeting as the leader of china, and guess what? Language is the main language of intercourse. Yes, the same one you and i are speaking right now. And so you live in that world. You live in the western world. And it's very hard to have illusions about what world you live in when you're under that you need those western banks. You need that foreign currency riht.

You're a despot as long as everyone implements your orders. And so if people start to say, quietly, not necessarily publicly, i may not implement that orders, that's maybe a criminal order.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>right? Well, you no, think about what we've learned about january sixth since january sixth, idnt you know, if youre think the two things, both before the sixth and after the sixth, that are particularly sobering to me. So, before the sixth, what's incredibly sobering is that there was, as we've now learned, this incredibly comprehensive effort to overturn the results of the election. That depended a great deal on if mike pence had just said, yes, where would we have been? We would have been through the looking glass on a constitutional crisis. If it in all this pressure focused on mike pent's saying yes to this comprehensive scheme to either flip the results write there on january sixth, or send them back to the states, and then creating an enormous of chaos. And then after mike pince says no, this is one thing that's incredibly sobering to me, as if you look at the approval ratings of donald trump and mike pince after january sixth, one of ther only one of the two, their approval rating plunges, and its mike pince, not donald trump. Incredible. So what that told me is that you had a republican party tat was so fully committed to this election steel effort, that even a long time republican who had stood by donald trump's side every moment of his presidency, who then appeals to his faith as an evangel lical who is sort of the representative of the evangelical base and the trump administration, appeals to his faith to do the right thing, and he's rejected by his own movement in favor of donald trump. And to me, in some ways, that was as sobering as all the ents that happened before that, not even the shock of the moment of january sixth could shake people from this hyper partisanship and animosity and distrust that led them down the road. Toto, stop the steel effort.</blockquote>

i think that we certainly have differences on a number of fronts. We're both small l liberals and both committed to american pluralism. And this is where i feel like the far right and the far left actually have a lot more in common than one might think. A woke and anti woke have a lot in common.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Ya, a, well, you know, only one thing. Just going back to what you were saying a moment ago, about our differences, i think that we certainly have differences on a number of fronts. We're both small l liberals and both committed to american pluralism. So in other words, you know, we both see a roll in a place, and should, and there should be a roll in a place for for each of us in american system. In the american, the american system is supposed to exist, is supposed to provide a place where atheist, atheist and christian can live side by side, and both communities can flourish, that sort of hall mark of the american classical liberal system when it's functioning well. And so i've always perceived you as being quite committed to american pluralism. And this is, i think, where a lot of the new, there's an old culture war, which is over things like gun control or abortion or religious liberty, and and there'san its being supplanted, i think, by a new culture ward that is really, quite frankly, over liberalism and pluralism itself. And and this is where i feel like the far right and the far left actually have a lot more in common than one might think. A woke and anti woke have a lot in common. And and the thing that they have in common is they are deeply questioning that american small liberalism. They're deeply questioning pluralism. And, you know, for example, the critical race theory argument.</blockquote>

The data indicates that trump's initial support was, a lot of it was located in non church going evangelicals. So there were some who were early in on trump, but then the snow ball effect locked in. The shocking victoryor the fact that nobody predicted, or very few people predicted, that he'd win, sent a messenger millions of tians that this was divine intervention. And i think that was the moment where allot of this loyalty locked in in a way that a lot of people don't truly appreciate it.

Now, the interesting thing was, the data indicates that trump's initial support was, a lot of it was located in non church going evangelicals. I know that sounds like a strange thing to say, non church going evangelicals, but sort of the more disconnected you were, the more the the disconnected you were from civic institutions, including a congregation, the more likely you are to support trump early on. But then once trump gained the nomination and it was him and hilary, then, of course, the dynamic changed. And so i think you you began to have a snowball effect. So there were some who were early in on trump, but then the snow ball effect locked in. And then the other thing that was really important othe sort of thi faith and prophecy based mind set, was the shocking victoryor the fact that nobody predicted, or very few people predicted, that he'd win, and he did win, sent a messenger millions of tians that this was divine intervention. And i think that was the moment where allot of this loyalty locked in in a way that a lot of people don't truly appreciate it.

<blockquote>In nature, animals roar and bare their teeth to intimidate adversaries ‚Äî but one side usually backs down, and real fights are rare. The wisdom of evolution is that the risk of violence is just too great. <br/><br/>Which might make one wonder: if war is so destructive, why does it happen? The question may sound na√Øve, but in fact it represents a deep puzzle. If a war will cost trillions and kill tens of thousands, it should be easy for either side to make a peace offer that both they and their opponents prefer to actually fighting it out. <br/><br/>The conundrum of how humans can engage in incredibly costly and protracted conflicts has occupied academics across the social sciences for years. In today's episode, we speak with economist Chris Blattman about his new book, Why We Fight: The Roots of War and the Paths to Peace , which summarises what they think they've learned. <br/><br/> Links to learn more, summary and full transcript. <br/><br/>Chris's first point is that while organised violence may feel like it's all around us, it's actually very rare in humans, just as it is with other animals. Across the world, hundreds of groups dislike one another ‚Äî but knowing the cost of war, they prefer to simply loathe one another in peace. <br/><br/>In order to understand what‚Äôs wrong with a sick patient, a doctor needs to know what a healthy person looks like. And to understand war, social scientists need to study all the wars that could have happened but didn't ‚Äî so they can see what a healthy society looks like and what's missing in the places where war does take hold. <br/><br/>Chris argues that social scientists have generated five cogent models of when war can be 'rational' for both sides of a conflict: <br/><br/>1. Unchecked interests ‚Äî such as national leaders who bear few of the costs of launching a war. <br/>2. Intangible incentives ‚Äî such as an intrinsic desire for revenge. <br/>3. Uncertainty ‚Äî such as both sides underestimating each other's resolve to fight. <br/>4. Commitment problems ‚Äî such as the inability to credibly promise not to use your growing military might to attack others in future. <br/>5. Misperceptions ‚Äî such as our inability to see the world through other people's eyes. <br/><br/>In today's interview, we walk through how each of the five explanations work and what specific wars or actions they might explain. <br/><br/>In the process, Chris outlines how many of the most popular explanations for interstate war are wildly overused (e.g. leaders who are unhinged or male) or misguided from the outset (e.g. resource scarcity). <br/><br/>The interview also covers: <br/><br/>‚Ä¢ What Chris and Rob got wrong about the war in Ukraine <br/>‚Ä¢ What causes might not fit into these five categories <br/>‚Ä¢ The role of people's choice to escalate or deescalate a conflict <br/>‚Ä¢ How great power wars or nuclear wars are different, and what can be done to prevent them <br/>‚Ä¢ How much representative government helps to prevent war <br/>‚Ä¢ And much more <br/><br/> Get this episode by subscribing to our podcast on the world‚Äôs most pressing problems and how to solve them: type 80,000 Hours into your podcasting app. <br/><br/><br/> Producer: Keiran Harris <br/>Audio mastering: Ben Cordell <br/>Transcriptions: Katy Moore</blockquote>

Three or four per cent of global g d p is spent on militaries directly. The interesting thing is that we spend all this money, actually, liking, training soldiers and buying all this equipment and so on. 99 % of the time, the soldiers are just sitting there, not ei in any actual war at all. Right? So the thing the w're not saying is that people weren't by armaments. The the thing that your modelling implies is that they'll rarely actually be used.

But the big inefficient thing that does happen is armin right? That unless we can find till i commit really sofdly to commit one another to disarm that we're just going to invest an enormous amount of social resources in that. And that's really hard to avoid. I mean, i think that's what when we do have states, when we do have alliances, that partly solves the problem. So, you know, you think about the western hemisphere, wehare the united states.</blockquote>

We tend to take our interpersonal violence and then we project that on to nations. That's a good example of one that i think is maybe overstated. And also, or our tendency what i call projection bias, as we then project that onto other situations may be erroneously so. It's these biases to have persistently erroneous beliefs that really matter in group behavior and individual behavior.

And an two things jump to mind. One is that, you know, the thing that we have experience o all the time is inter personal interactions, like our interactions with our spouse, our interactions with our boss, wewere these personal feelings are our more key. And so weare putting this analogy up to a much bigger scale. And</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>that there is, to me, aversion of the availability byasing, that we take what's available and we think that's more common.

What it is, as we actually form and hold strenuously on to erroneous beliefs despite contrary evidence. And</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>that</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>not the passions. It's our ability to sort of draw the wrong conclusion from incomplete information and then project it to other people in situations that is the misperception. That's one of the things, that's one of our on one of these causes of war. It's these biases to have persistently erroneous beliefs that really matter in group behavior and individual behavior, and the passions fade away.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Riht,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>so, i mean, i don't think this is the primary explanation for the american revolution. But i think we we can't ignore it because it's a factor. And i wanted to use something that was counter intuitive for people. It's really easy to sort of think o that liberian warlord. Of course, he said, we would never do that. And i wanted to sort of take one of the most iconically high integrity characters in history and sort of point out that even they were somewhat unchecked. Because certainly once, evenl certainly after revolution was run, most americans didn't vote, couldn'tvote. Certainly they weren't holding george washington and the other founding fathers fully accountable in the years running up to the revolution. And what's interesting, and many historians have noted, is that most of the founding fathers had a big economic stake in independence, or a very particular lena, trade and an tax policy with britain. It's no coincidence. And coincident, a lot of the people who remained loyalists had economic stakes in union with britain and with the british policies that britain wanted to impose on the united states. And so that surely influenced, along with all the other more noble motives that played a role, both in their willingness to launch the revolution, but had also played a role his. Washington was a notorious land speculator. He was a consumer. Wanted the fanciest clothes, the fanciest carriages, the land trappings of wealth. He pursued tat his entire life. And his pursuit of that land wealth is one of the things that set off the french and indian wars.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yet,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>this is like a really diverse category in n so never label. I loved and so intangible in sentis was the best of a bad bunch that i ain't captured. You could think of it as violence is a terminal category. But you could also think of it as violence just the thing that you value is actually not violence, but it's something that only violence can deliver. And so glory is an example. Vengeance is another example. There may be certain nationalist or ethnic or religious ideals about extending the power of your group, exterminating the heretic, exterminating the heretical view racial purity. So these have been more or less noble, many of them less noble, throughout history. In all these stories, as different as they are, share this similar logic, which is there was something ethereal. Wasn't like the material country or territory or economy or policy space that you were battling over. There is some value that you ved through violence, like glory, or that only violence could deliver you. But maybe the more important one, i think, for understanding a lot of conflicts, especially a lot of contemporary conflicts, which is also an intangible incentive, is that there's some ideal that we hold that we refuse to compromise on. So the ucranians refuse to compromise on their liberty. The american revolutionaries refuse to compromise on their liberty. And the tolibon refused to compromise, not so much on their liberty, but on a set of principles. The american administration, when dealing with the tolybon refused to compromise on a certain set of principles of justice and of a punishment of a grave crime. And so our intransigence on a principle is a kind of intangible incentive that essentially says, well, there's a bargain to be made that we should accept semi sovereignty as an american revolutionary or as a eucranian, because they are strong and we are weak, and i refuse. That is the sensible compromise.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Ya, the</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>fourth underlying driver of orlenci list co commitmen problems is kind of the inability to commit not abuse your power in future. Basically, if you have two actors, and one is quickly becoming more powerful than the other, then the rising party would probably like to commit to not take too much of the pie, to not exploit the other party in future, because that would stop them from being attacked now. But no matter, no matter what they say, the declining power knows that it's going to be in the rising power's interest to take advantage of them in future. And so now the rising power could basically try to directly pay off the declining power now yeout to attack them, which which does apparently often happen. But if the rise, if their risin power, is too steep, then they may just not be able to afford sufficiently large payout to motivate the declining power not to engage in a preenptive strike in order to stop their rise. Can you explain how this kind of commitment problem can it might help explain why world well ont occured.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yet, in that ancient greek example, i guess the stylized description is that athens was this rising power. Sparta was kind of declining relative to o athens. And so they were getting very skittish, though, geting very nervous about what athens might do in future when they're more powerful in dressing things. Because there was this third party, this kind of third balancing power. Athens could be in favour of that third party allying with sparta, so that sparta is less concerned about the rise of athens, because they be balanced in future, and so won't feel the need to launch a preemptive attack on athens. Like that this third party, like, makes a commitment kind of credible, or is a way of trading off something. Now, so the spotte doezen doesn't have to worry.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I mean, they didn't want o, mean that this the neutral power, had the second largest navy after athens. So they didn't naturally want that would be that would not be their preferred solution. The preferred solution wen actually for this third power, crosira, to remain neutral, neutral. And they tried to maintain that. So as carser tried to pull them into some of their disputes and things, the athenians resisted, and they tried to be neutral observers.

The model that you present in the book is kind of this dividing pie thing.

I think what you end up getting is, i think you then start to understand things like terrorism better. Terrorism is the weapon of the weakest. It's the way that you exercise bargaining power verses an incredibly strong foe.

And for simplicity in the book, you kind of conceptualize things in terms of, you know, different groups have different levels of power, and that changes their probability of winning the war and getting te the whole pie, at least the whole pie that's remaining after the destruction of the war. Which is a nice simplification, but it seems like, you know, more often in conflict, a small group would almost certainly lose a war because they dislike it so much, so much weaker. And instead of what's going on is that they have some ability to harm a much more powerful party, even if they can't like actually winner, we win a pitch battle. Tus. Thinking about dividing up the pie more in proportion to how much you can harm someone else, rather than your chance of winning an outright war. Can it change anything important about the conclusions that that spit out? You know,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>generally no. I think i thn that's why i could make the simplification, as most of the things we get are intact. I think, i think what you end up getting is, i think you then start to understand things like terrorism better. Terrorism is the weapon of the weakest. It's the way that you exercise bargaining power verses an incredibly strong foe. Not because you think the terrists are going to manage to take over the country, very seldom happens, butthe leverage violence against civilians, but the fear of violence, to obtain concessions or obtain some other aim. And so so i think it helps you to understand a greater variety of violence, but a lot of the same, the same principles, the idea that peace is optimal, and thatin a lot of the five sources of breakdown still play.</blockquote>

And likewise, when the united states was trying to convince the talabon government of afghanistan that we'll invade you don't hand over laden both the talibon were thinking about their reputation, but more importantly, i think the united states was thinking about every other potential enemy, conventional or terrorist, that would be watching to see what they do. And so i don't think we can understand the america, america's 20 year war, and i don't think we can understand sdam husein's branksmanship, or the bush decision to invade rok without thinking about how they were trying to, in an uncertain world, signal resolve to a wider audience in order to move every other bargaining game a little bit in their favour.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Ya, ye, that's the thing that can make a lot of sense, isuppose of how you would be willing to bear such huge costs. Because, lk, why would you go into a total war just to show that you feelits like you you're losing everything? T a yu, were trying to protect. Y, so you need to have some like, broader considerations that are beyond the scope of that in order to make sense of the costthink maybe let's come back to that, ecause i wonder, i want to talk a bit about the the war in ukrane, and like what we've gotten right and wrong, and maybe like how these haw these modeals get applied to that, beyond what we've already already talked about.</blockquote>

Ihave a russian colleague who as eminent game theorist and and was once the head of one of the most eminent universities in moscow. He's now here, who has a completely different view than mine. He gets obviously a more information right. But he he's, despite being a strategic thinker and someone who studies rtegic thinkers, he thinks this is very irrational. It's all misperceptions and intangible incentives in an insular, degenerated inner circle around putton. I don't know if that's right. I'm not totally persuaded by him. I certainly think it's a role. I thinkhe, i can't quite convince myself he's fully right. Not everyone agrees with him, even who are other experts. But it's a good example. It's a totally plausible state of the world. We learn from this is going to depend on what was actually going on, because i can, i can articulate, and i have here, like the strategic logic of the invasion, especially russia strategic logic to invade makes even more sense in like a cold, calculated, brutal way, but in a real politic no kind of sense. It makes sense given if if the cranians are the noble, nobly and transigent defenders of liberty, then the compromise, then you're just going to have to seize it is is the rational just like that was maybe the qo correct decision for the can in the american revolution. So, but, but if if i'm wrong, and my colleague is right, that they're just not thinking strategically at all, that means that any solution that follows my advice would be a terrible one. A likewise, any if he's wrong, any solution that follows his advice would be a terrible one. It's a little bit like going back to our doctrinalogy, ye, like you have to have the treatment sints the disease. And we don't have a clearing diagnosis right now beause there's so many mysteries.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So so first of all, i think russia's divide and conquer strategy with its neighbors has been working. Andad they've not had any mechanism by which they can band together to collectively resist this a. That's all. So, you know, tim fry has a brush expert at columbia university, as a fabulous book published last year, where he also talks. But that's how puten, that's how many dictators, including putton, av power and personalized power s. There's lots of oligarchs, there's lots of military generals, there's lots of powerful governors as but they were never banded together to collectively resist him. And so he was able to sort of divide and conquer. And so that's the stratage that works well for him. And now there is an alliance, the</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>nativ alliance, plus ukraine,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>that is drawing a line, sort of, right? You know, the natives is really drawing that firm a line. They're supporting ukrane. They're not actually allies. They're not militarily getting involved. So you can understand maybe the westw ess to fuel this war on those terms. And that's, that's a kind of unchecked leaders or unchecked interests argument wright that says, listen, cranes are paying the costs, not us. It's really easy to draw a line in the sand if it's not our sand. It's the story behind every proxy war. So we're fighting a proxy war hin crane. It's a nobler proxy war than most proxy wars. But every proxy war is, in some ways the product of unchecked interest because there's some super power or some neighboring power that's fuelling one side of the conflict, even when it makes sense to deal from the perspective of those two very local warring parties. Ya, yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Y, yes, i laid out just a second ago, of reputation, escalate. Lke the argument for escalation on the basis of trying to show how how fierce you are. From from nety's point of view, itrestin like russia internally can have a similar kind of argument, where they like while we deployed all our troops to the border and threatened to go to war. And if we back down now, then people are just never going to take our threats seriously again. So we have to go to war, even if wethin gets a mistake, in this case, just in order to let again, convince people that we're willing to go to war in future cases, people laughing our faces. Yes,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>that kind of face saving, if it's about signalling reputation can happen. I think it maybe a little exaggerated. And and all sides recognize this. And so finding ways that russia can save face or serve like a natural peace building strategy. But a special case of this is something political scientists call audience costs, which is that if we think that putton would be deposed if he lost, then on the one hand, you might think, great. Glad to see you go. On the other hand, that is an incentive for him to just keep fighting beyond where it makes any sense, whatever. And so thereisre's a certain logic to letting some one like putton not lose completely, and letting him say face, in order to paying price of knowing that the regime will not change, but at least it will end the war.</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
The author is partly convinced on the basis of t idea that over centralized power accentuates all five kinds of conflict. He says democratic peace theory doesn't hold true for countries like liberia, where there's a dictator every five years. The most important check to peace building isn't an elected president but division of power across branches and levels of government," he writes.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So this is an ary where i think that the the theory ind a lot of the casual empirics are really strong, and then the hard tests are pretty rare, and or, you kno, difficult to believe, fully, but i'm partly convinced on the basis of t idea. In the casea, it goes back to this broader point about over centralized power being the root of accentuating all five kinds of conflict bicas mechanically is going to make leaders more inchecked and less likely internalized cost. But it means we're at the mercy of their misreceptions. We're at the mercy of their intangible incentives. There's more uncertainty. They can't commit, and so it just aggravates all thes arches of war. And i think that is, to me, a very plausible rational for why checked, highly checked and balanced societies very seldom go to war against any one, against one another. And when they do go to war, it's usually against a relatively unchecked society where they can't find a mutual bargaining range. But i'm careful to sort of talk in the book about these sort of checked and balance societies, rather democratic, because democratic people think t means, you know, most people s leap to thinking as the is the president elected or not? But then there's a lot of countries like liberia where wo're electing a dictator every five years. That's a slight exaggeration, but they're just not, they're not that checkd and balance. They have a lot of autonomy and and so an election for the executive is actually not the most important check for my prorspective for peace building. It's actually the division of power within the country, across branch os tho government, across levels of government in the country, anto these like supernational organizations. So anything that does that is going to make things more peaceable. So i totally by democratic peace theory. But the idea that it's just like some simple, oh, if we all had elections for president, we'd have a peaceful world, that that's not true. Yes, i guess.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>see. So in the accountability story, that the point is that they, they haven't gone to war in a way that would harm the united states, because it's a democracy, and leaders would lose if that happened.

<blockquote>Imagine you lead a nonprofit that operates on a shoestring budget. Staff are paid minimum wage, lunch is bread and hummus, and you're all bunched up on a few tables in a basement office. <br/><br/>But over a few years, your cause attracts some major new donors. Your funding jumps a thousandfold, from $100,000 a year to $100,000,000 a year. You're the same group of people committed to making sacrifices for the cause ‚Äî but these days, rather than cutting costs, the right thing to do seems to be to spend serious money and get things done ASAP. <br/><br/>You suddenly have the opportunity to make more progress than ever before, but as well as excitement about this, you have worries about the impacts that large amounts of funding can have. <br/><br/>This is roughly the situation faced by today's guest Will MacAskill ‚Äî University of Oxford philosopher, author of the forthcoming book What We Owe The Future , and founding figure in the effective altruism movement. <br/><br/> Links to learn more, summary and full transcript. <br/><br/>Years ago, Will pledged to give away more than 50% of his income over his life, and was already donating 10% back when he was a student with next to no income. Since then, the coalition he founded has been super successful at attracting the interest of donors who collectively want to give away billions in the way Will and his colleagues were proposing. <br/><br/>While surely a huge success, it brings with it risks that he's never had to consider before: <br/><br/>‚Ä¢ Will and his colleagues might try to spend a lot of money trying to get more things done more quickly ‚Äî but actually just waste it. <br/>‚Ä¢ Being seen as profligate could strike onlookers as selfish and disreputable. <br/>‚Ä¢ Folks might start pretending to agree with their agenda just to get grants. <br/>‚Ä¢ People working on nearby issues that are less flush with funding may end up resentful. <br/>‚Ä¢ People might lose their focus on helping others as they get seduced by the prospect of earning a nice living. <br/>‚Ä¢ Mediocre projects might find it too easy to get funding, even when the people involved would be better off radically changing their strategy, or shutting down and launching something else entirely. <br/><br/>But all these 'risks of commission' have to be weighed against 'risk of omission': the failure to achieve all you could have if you'd been truly ambitious. <br/><br/>People looking askance at you for paying high salaries to attract the staff you want is unpleasant. <br/><br/>But failing to prevent the next pandemic because you didn't have the necessary medical experts on your grantmaking team is worse than unpleasant ‚Äî it's a true disaster. Yet few will complain, because they'll never know what might have been if you'd only set frugality aside. <br/><br/>Will aims to strike a sensible balance between these competing errors, which he has taken to calling judicious ambition . In today's episode, Rob and Will discuss the above as well as: <br/><br/>‚Ä¢ Will humanity likely converge on good values as we get more educated and invest more in moral philosophy ‚Äî or are the things we care about actually quite arbitrary and contingent? <br/>‚Ä¢ Why are so many nonfiction books full of factual errors? <br/>‚Ä¢ How does Will avoid anxiety and depression with more responsibility on his shoulders than ever? <br/>‚Ä¢ What does Will disagree with his colleagues on? <br/>‚Ä¢ Should we focus on existential risks more or less the same way, whether we care about future generations or not? <br/>‚Ä¢ Are potatoes one of the most important technologies ever developed? <br/>‚Ä¢ And plenty more. <br/><br/> Get this episode by subscribing to our podcast on the world‚Äôs most pressing problems and how to solve them: type 80,000 Hours into your podcasting app. <br/><br/><br/> Producer: Keiran Harris <br/>Audio mastering: Ben Cordell <br/>Transcriptions: Katy Moore</blockquote>

And there's clear variation in people's diet, and that really makes a moral difference. Well, so that's i think, a very clear case of moral contingency.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yes, omthing. So, i've been on this thick learning about theology and old, old religion the last six months. One of my just favorite crazy facts about history of religion ists. O so, the janes have ben round for ry long time. This, like indian religions, yes, to some extent, sort of a precursor to buddhism. So i think, like, around four thousand b c, they already have this concern that you couldn't eat particular kind of root vegetables, because if they tended to attract insects on to them. And so if you like, pulled this carrots out of the ground and then ate them, you'd be harming the insects that are, that are on on these likeegebles.

### [01:02:11] Be Ambitious Because of the Fat Tailed Distribution

#### ‚ú® Summary
The unofficial theme for this particular conference is a culture of ambition. If you are altruistic, should you try and be very ambitious or have ambitious plans? And i think there's a few reasons for that. One is kind of more theoretical. So if you just aim to do kind of a typical amount of good, then you're going to do much less good in expectation. Then if you're like, really aiming for the best,. The best outcomes are just way, way better than the, you know, just kind of typical outcomes.

If you are altruistic, should you try and be very ambitious or have ambitious plans? And i think there's a few reasons for that. So one is kind of more theoretical. So if you think the distribution of impact is a fat tailed distribution, that means that your, the mean impact is bigger than the medium. So if you just aim to do kind of a typical amount of good, then you're going to do much less good in expectation. And, ah, i think plausibly, it's like the expected value of the good that you do that matters. Then if you're like, really aiming for the best. And that's because, in the nature of the distribution, the best outcomes are just way, way better than the, you know, just kind of typical outcomes. And so there's, again, this, you know, theoretical case, and we've seen that in practice as well.</blockquote>

On Today's Episode: Roughly 1% of the world is said to be millionaires, and the fraction of the worldwide population that are billionaires are even fewer. So, no bullsh*t, what does it take to become a billionaire, or even a millionaire. The answer comes down to habits and mindset. Ultra-successful people think and move differently from everyone else. You may have heard Jim Rohn‚Äôs quote, ‚Äúsuccessful people do what unsuccessful people are not willing to do.‚Äù This applies across the board. If billion dollar status is a goal, and being ultra wealthy and successful is high on your list of priorities, start today with your habits. Focus on the right things that create forward progress, ask the hard questions, and question everything. In this episode, 5 ultra-successful guests share what it takes and explain the inner workings and habits you can start to adopt and apply immediately. Dean Graziosi is an entrepreneur and investor that changed his life through real estate. Robin Sharma, former attorney turned leadership expert, has written books such as The 5 AM Club and The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari changed his life through spirituality. Ed Mylett is a peak performance expert and author of The Power of One More. Patrick Bet-David is the ultra-successful businessman from humble beginnings and author of Your Next Five Moves.

#### ‚ú® Summary
"There's nothing good in my life right now. You can't find anything your life to be grateful for," he says. "On the drive home, i'm not kidding you, i started to stack gratitude." His wife told him she didn't recognize who he was or what he was about. A stranger walked by his table and greeted him with a warm smile.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>at it. I had a couple f good things happened for me, or to me. One was, at that time, my wife did get frank with me, this is not who you are. This is what you're about. I don't recognize this person. This is who you are. And i had a other person, to my benefit, pointing out to me the things that were great about me. This is going to sound hoky, but i'm going to give you the big one, and this is why life gives you these great tests. I had a really good friend of mine, i went to lunch, and he said, i don't know who this guy is here in front of me, ind he goes the mass. You question honestly right now, what are you grateful for? And at the lunch i said, jack, shit, nothing, brother. There's nothing good in my life right now. And i'm not exaggerating this to you when i tell you this, and this is a factual story, as i'm mouthing these words, people walked in with an older man. Both of them clearly were fighting cancer. Somehow both had lost their hair. One of the ladies had a bonnet on. And they were barely moving in both, walked by our table and gave me the most warm greeting, the warmest smile, as a stranger. Anigos, that's pretty frick and pathetic. You can't find anything your life to be grateful for right now. And on the drive home, i'm not kidding you, i started to stack gratitude. I started to take inventory. Because if you can find things to be grateful for in that space, man, is your life going to be rich when there really are external things to be grateful for. So my first mechanism out of that space was, honestly, to stack the things i was grateful for. And i started reinforcing it over and over and over again. And what happens is, there's this particular activating system in our brains, right?</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
The way you move your body is an emotion. You don't just feel them, you do them. The quickest way to change our behavior, our emotions and our state is with our body. That's something that completely changed my life, obviously. And every time somebody asks me a question about, you know, how do i, i'm lost. I feel out of control," he said.

And every time somebody asks me a question about, you know, how do i, i'm lost. I feel, you know, completely out of control. I don't have confidence. My answers work out too so,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>why? Well, i think everything in our bot, i think everything in our lives, starts with our body. If you're a person of faith, you believe that's where your soul is housed, right? And so it's the you you do emotions. You don't just feel them, you do them. In other words, and you know this from things you've learned in your life, but like, joy is an actual action, not just an emotion. We feel a certain joy. There's a certain breathing, a certain movement in our body. Depression and sadness is something we do. We're more hunched over. Our breathing is more shallow, right? And so there's a correlation between the way you move your body and your emotions. There directly. This is even before we get to dopamen hits and our nervous system being. I'm just telling you that the way you move your body is an emotion. You do emotions. And so when you move your body, you can't be in full workout mode, moving your body, running, king, jumping jacks, jump rope, and be depressed. They don't go together simultines because your body doesn't get the connectionn i'm moving like i'm joyful. I'm moving like i'm having sex. I'm moving like i'm happy. These are all joyful states. You can't be depressed simultaneously. So the quickest way to change our behavior, our emotions and our state is with our body.</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
Identity is the governor on our lives. It's the invisible force that no one understands. Once they do understand and get hold of it, their life can change. If you're at 80 degrees, that internal therm stet will find a way to cool your life right back down again. To be the most powerful force in the world, i think, is to be consistent with the concepts, ideas and worth that you hold for yourself.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>You've</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>leveraged identity really powerfully. How have you done it? And, like, what are some specific moments where identity came to your rescue? So identity is the governor on our lives. It's the invisible force that no one understands. And once they do understand and get hold of it, their life can change. And so not only, if you don't get hold of this, will these outward conditions of your life keep being exactly the same, but it's you could be ave differetly. Could do all the work andout you could be thinking great thoughts, but you are going to get out of your life. You're ging to be the most powerful force in the world, i think, is to be consistent with the concepts, ideas and worth that you hold for yourself. You will get that out of your life. What you will tolerate. The deeper part of that is identity. And so identity is very much likea mostat sitting on a wall, right? This is important. Once that temperature is set at a certain degree, everything in the world, externally, can hit it. And you will find a way to get that temperature. So even in this house, let's say it's set at 80 degrees, if we opened up all the doors in cold air, just the worst things in life, the blizzard of life, came in, the thermostat will kick the heater and will regulate this room back to 80 degrees. The reverse is also true. It's a super hot day. Great things are happening in your life. It's getting hotter and hotter and hotter. If you're at 80 degrees, that internal therm stet will find a way, over a window of time, to cool your life right back down to 80 degrees again. So the key, the secret key, is to be able to shift that identity 90, a hundred, hundred, ad 20. So some of the way strategies to do that are very simple. One is, if i, let's thi safe financially.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>does. They say, we'm going to kind of hack it to do that. Anyway, when you find people hacking your product to do something it wasn't intended to do, pay attention to that and double down on that um. And then often what you initiate create will seem to fit into an existing market, but with less functionality, right? So it's the same thing with the iphone. It it's the same thing with web. Oftentimes it doesn't have three g it doesn't have aps, it doesn't have any of these things initially. But what it does do is it enables a whole new market, a whole set of new entrances to come and use your product. And so the success of the iphone wasn't that it successfully competed against smart phones. It sure looked like a smart phone, but it wasn't competing against any smart phones that were out there. Because what happened is, there was maybe, at that point in time, i was a heavy palm trio user, there was maybe a couple million smart phone users in the united states. What the iphone did is made everyone a smart phone user. And so there is all send a whole bunch of new entrance. And in overtime, it also canibalized the existing smart phone market. Ah, so a lot of times people may sort of mistake you for incumbents when you're crning entirely new market. So the next is on building a remarkable product. So what does this process look like? Ad, i'lltry break it down into very literal steps about exactly what you should be doing. Ah, so everyone knows this, right? Step one, have a great idea. Step two talks customers. Step three, something happens there. And step four, profit. Right? Everyone knows his. But what is step three, right? Cause that's where everyone's plodding around in the desert, like, trying to figure out what the hell to do, and nothing's working. So let's talk about step three. So</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>step three is literally this list of things. So</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>you talk to customers and develop a market thesis. Try to understand exactly what their pain point is. What's that job they're trying to get done, and how can you help them get it done faster or better? Um, this is really important, listen to their problems, not their solutions.</blockquote>

You need to build a team that can very, very quickly, iterate, rinse and repeat a ok, this is another important point. Test slution with customers. So here are your here are your a. There's some helpful tools here, but the most important rules are, number one, make sure you're talking to a target customer. Ah, so it's not helpful to just talk to any one. Make sure it's the one youre targeting. But make sure that you are superflexible on changing your view on who those target customers are. So when you talk to someone and it seems like, hey, this isn't my target customer, but then i'll there's a whole bunch of em showing up and they're hacking and doing really interesting things with your product, you should pay attention to that in a potential change who your target customer is. Number two, don't overthink it. I think this is a problem lot smart people can have. You obviously y want to rely on data. You want to rely on market research. You get really, really into the weeds and the strategy, and you super overthink everything. Am, don't overthink it. Anecdotas, ok. Am, just getting in there and building and launching something, trying it out and iterating is the most important thing you can do. Doing all your home work, all your research. You know, looking at the market, looking at the strategy. It can be the perfect strategy. Ca, be the perfect strategy, but no one's going to use your product. Ahm, so don't don't overthink it. A, here are base three tools. I think these are probably the only three tat you need. A number one, customer interviews. You probly need about five to ten of these a.</blockquote>

It said, ema, address, password, and we're about to launch it. But we had the practice of doing this before we launch thing. And so i got a couple o people down. They were just friends, and i sent em for nte lap tilli, said, sign up andd these pretect people and am. And about forty five seconds later thet turned sa, i don't, i don't know how to sign up. How do you not know how to sign up? It says sign up here in a hundred point font, like, what the hell's going ona? Another side point, people don't read a so so and i sil why don't you know how to sign up? Its right here. Ad said, oh, that makes so much sense. Well, i just didn't look at that cause i assumed emal pastwor as a login form, obviously. Ah, so wasn't a sign a form as a login form. So we added a gratuitous field that just says your name so that we could have three fields. And all sone people saw it as a sign a form. A, which is incredible. A. This is the kind of thing we would have never discovered if we hadn't done u. So i'ld recommend doing it all the time for everything you launch. You don't need that many sessions. Ok, here's another question comes up. When should we launch? Ah, there's this whole a minimum viable product, which i think is a lot of the thinking is, is is good. It's new sinse, we launched. But i don't really like the word viable, because it's kind of insinuatingthatyo're going to put, like, the, like, just the least crappy thing you can out there. Im i much prefer a, the worda remarkable. So minimum remarkable product, the product that is the least you can build to be remarkable. All right, so this is a quote from pabohit says, launch when your product is better than what's out there.</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
If you track that metric more than anything else, that is the indicator that things are working. I remember handing out wheebly logans to all my friends and family, and none of them came back. And if they're not coming back, then no one's going to come back. So i think number one, tracking return usage is realy important. Number two, track n p s. The percentage of people who answer nine or ten, those are a promoters. If it's above 50, you're doing pretty well. Renewals cohort based. Um, so churn is just looking at number subscribers lost, divided by a toa act of subscribers in any given period.

Just look at people who</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>sign up or come to your sight or you're apt, and look at the number of people who come back within a day, with three days, within seven days, within 30 days, right? If you track that metric more than anything else, that is the indicator that things are working. 'm in the early stages. I remember handing out wheebly logans to all my friends and family, and none of them came back. And those are the people who like you the most, and those are the people who would really want you to be successful. And if they're not coming back, then no one's going to come back. Ah. And so i think number one, tracking return usage is realy important. Number two, track n p s. There's all kinds of tools to do this now. Or n p s. Some people say forty. I think about 50. It's above 50, then you'd probably cheap prot market fit m n p s. If you ever answerd that question, would you recommend this proter service to a friend? That's n p s. It's one question. You rank from zero to ten. A basically the percentage of people who answer nine or ten, those are a promoters. The percentage of people who answer zero to six, those are detractors. And people who answer seven or eight are thrown out. So in the early days a weble had an m p s of 80 %. That was basically 88 % of people answered nine or ten, eight % of people answered zero to six. And by matthew's right, 12 % of people answered seven or eight. So ba, takea 88 % minus eight % equals 80. If it's above 50, you're doing pretty well. M the way thismetric is built, it can get negative, and that's probably where it will start. A, and the number three, paying customer renewal rate. S when you have paying customers, look at their renewal rates. Um, a quick side bar, i don't like the churn metric for looking at this. A lot of people use that because it's easier to calculate. Ah, but basically, churn is not cohort base. Renewals cohort based. Um, so churn is just looking at number subscribers lost, divided by a toa act of subscribers in any given period. I don't like that, because if you're a denominator, m is changing like less at you're growing really rally quickly. Your denominar is changing fast.

You'll know when you achieved it when your customers are beating a path to your door. When you don't have it, everything feels hard. It feels like you're pushing this huge rock up a mountain.

And that's cohort base. So i like renewal rates a lot better. All right, a next a metrick that aren't included. So number one metrick that is not included is sign ups. This is something that was not very well understood when we got started. I would not pay that much attention to sign ups. I would pay a lot of attention to active users. U if you have good returning usage, and sign ups translates the active users pretty well. If you have bad returning usage, then sign up basically like completely drops off, and you have very little active users. In fact, that number may even be shrinking, even when your stiamps are growing, if people aren't returning. A number two, conversion rate. If if you're thinking of building a sas business, conversion rates, they all start low. They build over time. I wouldn't pay a lot of attention to conversion rate in the beginning. I'd pay attention to some of the other metrics. A, i think it's the last point. Just how does it feel when you get product market fit? Ah, you'll know when you achieved it when your customers are beating a path to your door. A, when you don't have it, everything feels hard. It feels like you're pushing this huge rock up a mountain. You're a pushing your customers towards the solution. They're too nice to tell you no, but they're not really coming back. They're not really using it. When you have it, the whole world is beating a path to your door. Everyone wants to use it. Ah, pressis writing about it. Everything feels easy, and every decision you make feels like you're a genius, because they all go, well, ah, you know, t spoiler alert, it's somewhere in between. Ah, it turns out that, you know, as you're scaling your business overtime, you'll discover, ah, you're maybe a little less smart than you thought you were. Ah, but, but, but, that comes later. A but, i think this is what it feels like. So if you're not feeling that, you know, sort of, customers pulling you in a direction world, you know, beating a path to your door, then you probably don't have it yet. All right, now, a couple more points. A beyond prok market fit, this is a little bit more theoretical.</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
Don't scale the team until you have product market fit a. Between about 23 and 25 is when everything breaks in a start up, because you can no longer be completely flat. Soth, there's aa essay here which he hubspot growth framework, which i'd highly recommend reading for a little bit more on this.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>right? Your your a a, your your the model, the wayth you charge people, you know, t doesn't work. Maybe you're not charging enough, maybe you're charging too much. That has a lot of interplay with your channel. And this is how you acquire customers, right? So if your model em ifi, for example, if you're building am a solution, and you're trying to charge 75 dollars a month for it, that's probn be a pretty tough spot to businessis because you're goig to be in the middle. You're knot going to be able to afford a sales force, right? You'r kotkoing o buld afford actual people selling your product to the customers directly, but it's too much money that people are going to want to just whip out their credit card and start paying that, right? And so that's why, oftentimes, you know, between the model and the channel, there needs to be a fit there as well. Because if you're going, if your gon to have a sales force, you're progonne to charge people at least two 300 dollars a month to build a ford the sales forse. And if you ar can to ave a sales horse, and you should probably charge 25 dollars a month or less. This all, of course, plays with the product and market fit a, which, which is how this all works together. Soth, there's aa essay here which he hubspot growth framework, which i'd highly recommend reading for a little bit more on this. A another side bar is on scaling the team. So i think this is a really important point to make, a don't scale the team until you have product market fit a. So i would not scale pass about 20 people. So around 20 people, choose. Between about 23 and 25 is when everything breaks in a start up, because you can no longer be, ah, just just, you know, completely flat. If you look at any of the essays, you know, if you look at, you kow back in the day, 37 signals hat this. Ssay is likt, how being a perfectly flat company is amazing, and no one ever needs to hire managers. Ansay, i could predict to within one or two employees, exactly the size you are, and it's about three to 25. And it turns out that was true, because about 23 t 25, it feels amazing. It's completely flat. Ah, just another couple of people and everything breaks.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In this episode, I explain the biology and psychology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)‚Äîa prevalent and debilitating condition. I also discuss the efficacy and mechanisms behind OCD treatments‚Äîboth behavioral and pharmacologic as well as holistic and combination treatments and new emerging treatments, including directed brain stimulation. I explain the neural circuitry underlying repetitive ‚Äúthought-action loops‚Äù and why in OCD, the compulsive actions merely make the obsessions even stronger. I review cognitive-behavioral therapies like exposure therapy and SSRIs, holistic approaches, and nutraceuticals, detailing the efficacy of each approach and what science says about how to combine and sequence treatments. I describe an often effective approach for treating OCD where clinicians use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to deliberately bring patients into states of high anxiety while encouraging them to suppress compulsive actions in order to help them learn to overcome repetitious thought/action cycles. This episode should interest anyone with OCD, anyone who knows someone with OCD or OCPD, and more generally, those interested in how the brain works to control thoughts and actions, whether those thoughts are intrusive or not.<br/> Thank you to our sponsors AG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman <br/> Thesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman <br/> Eight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman <br/> Supplements from Momentous https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman .<br/> For the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com .<br/> Timestamps (00:00:00) Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)<br/> (00:03:01) Momentous Supplements, AG1 (Athletic Greens), Thesis, Eight Sleep<br/> (00:08:28) What is OCD and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder?<br/> (00:11:18) OCD: Major Incidence & Severity<br/> (00:15:10) Categories of OCD<br/> (00:21:33) Anxiety: Linking Obsessions & Compulsions<br/> (00:27:33) OCD & Familial Heredity<br/> (00:29:10) Biological Mechanisms of OCD, Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loops<br/> (00:39:36) Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loop & OCD<br/> (00:46:39) Clinical OCD Diagnosis, Y-BOCS Index<br/> (00:51:38) OCD & Fear, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) & Exposure Therapy<br/> (01:01:56) Unique Characteristics of CBT/Exposure Therapy in OCD Treatment<br/> (01:10:18) CBT/Exposure Therapy & Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)<br/> (01:22:30) Considerations with SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments<br/> (01:25:17) Serotonin & Cognitive Flexibility, Psilocybin Studies<br/> (01:31:50) Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators<br/> (01:36:09) OCD & Cannabis, THC & CBD<br/> (01:39:29) Ketamine Treatment<br/> (01:41:43) Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)<br/> (01:46:22) Cannabis CBD & Focus<br/> (01:47:50) Thoughts Are Not Actions<br/> (01:51:27) Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA<br/> (02:00:55) Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD<br/> (02:03:28) Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine<br/> (02:09:45) OCD vs. Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder<br/> (02:20:53) Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions<br/> (02:31:00) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter<br/> Title Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac <br/> Disclaimer</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Welcome to the huberman lab podcast. Wr we discuss science and science base tools for everyday life. I'm andrew huberman, and i'm a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine. To day we are talking about obscessive compulsive disorder, or o c d. We are also going to talk about obsessive compulsive personality disorder, which, as you will soon learn, is distinct from obsessive compulsive disorder. In fact, many people that refer to themselves or others as obsessive or compulsive, or having o c d, or o c d about this, or o c d about that, do not have clinically diagnosil o c d. Rather, many people have obsessive compulsive personality disorder. However, there are many people in the world that have actual o c d. And for those people there is a tremendous amount of suffering. In fact, o c d turns out to be number seven on the list of most debilitating illnesses, not just psychiatric illnesses, but of all illnesses, which is remarkable and somewhat frightening. The good news is, thanks to the fields of psychiatry, psychology and science in general, there are now excellent treatments for o c d.</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
O c d has mainly to do with obsessions that are intrusive and recurrent. People often invite or like the particular terns of thought that lead them to be compulsive along certain dimensions. It is possible to have recurrent and intrusive obsessions and not engage in the sorts of behaviours that would ever allow people to notice that somebody has o c d. That contour, or that pattern of behaviors. And thoughts interacting. Is very different than obsessive compulsive personality disorder which involves a sense of delayed gratification.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So unlike an itch that you feel and then you scratch it, feels better, o c d is more like an itch that you feel, you scratch it, and the itch intensifies. That contour, or that pattern of behaviors. And thoughts interacting. Is very different than obsessive compulsive personality disorder, which mainly involves a sense of delayed gratification that people want and somewhat en oy because it allows them to function better or more in line with how they would like to show up in the world. So again, o c d has mainly to do with obsessions that are intrusive and recurrent. Whereas obsessive compulsive personality disorder does not have that intrusive feature to it. People do not mind, or in fact, often invite or like the particular terns of thought that lead them to be compulsive along certain dimensions. So leaving aside obsessive compulsive personality disorder for the moment, let's focus a bit more on o c d and define how it tends to show up in the world. First of all, o c d is extremely common. In fact, current estimates are that anywhere from two point five % to as high as three or even four % of people suffer from true o c d. That is an astonishingly high number. Now the reason the range is so big, two point five % all the way up to three or maybe even four %, is that a lot of the features of o c d go unnoticed, both in the clinitions office and simply because people don't report it and don't talk about it. In fact, it is possible to have recurrent and intrusive obsessions and not engage in the sorts of behaviours that would ever allow people to notice that somebody has o c d.</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
The idea here is that the obsessions and compulsions are bound by anxiety. By going right, it doesn't create a situation in thebr n and psychology of the person that, ah, you know what, i'm not anxious any more. yet it feels as if it would. In fact, in some cases, it feel as if they went left, they would have a full blown panic attack.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And yet it feels as if it would. In fact, in some cases, it feels as if they went left, they would have a full blown panic attack. So the idea here is that the obsessions and compulsions are bound by anxiety. But then by taking a right hand turn, again, in this one particular example, by taking a right hand turn, there is a very brief, i should mention, very brief, relief of that anxiety at the time of the decision to right, not left. And there's an additional drop in anxiety while one takes the right hand turn, as opposed to the left hand turn. And then, as i alluded to before, there's a reinforcement of the compulsion. In other words, by going right, it doesn't create a situation in thebr n and psychology of the person that, ah, you know what, i'm not anxious any more. Left would have probably been ok. It reinforces the idea that right made me feel better, or turning right made me feel better, and going left would have been that much worse. Again, it reinforces the obsession even further. And again, we could swap out right turns and left turns with something like hand washing. The feeling that something is contaminated and the need to wash one's hands, even though one already wash their hands 20, 30, 50 times prior nd were ae. He goigto go back to that example a little bit later when we talk about one particular category of therapies that are very active in many people for o c d, which are the cognive behavior and exposure therapies.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I think some of you have heard of cogniv behavior and exposure therapies, but the way they are used to treat o c d is very much different than the way they are used to treat other sorts of anxiety disorders and other sorts of disorders generally. So it's fair to say that up to 70 % of people with o c d have some sort of anxiety, or elevated anxiety, either directly related to the o c d or indirectly related to the o c d. And it's really hard to tease those apart, because o c d can create its own anxiety, as i mentioned before. It can even increase its own anxiety. And there's also an issue of depression.</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
Clinics often try to get people to tolerate, not relieve, their anxiety. Todo is to short circuit that neural circuit with the relief of anxiety brought on by engaging in the compulsion related to the obsession. By forcing them down the path of inquiry, that leads them to the place where they very clear ly identify the fear, the anxiety, it raises the anxiety in them.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I wish i could tell you that's the case, but it turns out it's the opposite. What the clinitian is actually trying to do is get people to feel more anxiety, not less. What they're trying to get them. Todo is to short circuit, no pun intended to intervene in their own neural circuit, i should say, with that relief of anxiety, however brief, brought on by engaging in the compulsion related to the obsession. So whereas typically some one would feel the obsession with, i don't want to turn left ecause something bad i's going o happen, someone's going to die, and then they turn right, they never get the option or the opportunity to really explore what would happen were they to turn left, or to not be able to turn right. By forcing them down the path of inquiry, that leads them to the place where they very clear ly identify the fear, the anxiety, it raises the anxiety in them. And that's actually what the clinition is. After cogni behavior therapy and exposure therapy, in the context of o c d, most often involves trying to get people to tolerate, not relieve, their anxiety. This is extremely important, and i realize there's variation to this depending on the style of cogni behavior therapy, the style of exposure therapy, but almost across the board, the goal, again, is to get people to feel the anxiety that normally they are able to at least partially relieve, however briefly, by engaging in the compulsion. So if we think back to that circuit of cortico strital phylamic, what's going on here?</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
In anxiety treatment, the goal would be to teach people to dampen their anxiety through breathing techniques. Here it's the opposite. What they're trying to get the patient to do is to really feel the anxiety at its maximum and then do the exact opposite of whatever the normal compulsion is. Now i want to be very clear, this is not the sort of thing you want to do on your own. This is done by trained, licensed psychologists and psychiatrists. But none the less, it really points to the fact that, as a anxiety related disorder, oset is distinct from other types of anxiety.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Now in the context of anxiety treatment, or other types of treatment, the goal would be to teach people to dampen, to lessen, their anxiety through breathing techniques, or through visualization techniques, or through self talk, or through social support, any of the number of things that are well known to help people self regulate their own anxiety. Here it's the opposite. What they're trying to get the patient to do is to really feel the anxiety at its maximum, but then do the exact opposite of whatever the normal compulsion is. So if normally the compulsion is to wash one's hands, then the idea is to suppressed hand washing while being in the experience of the utmost anxiety. Or in the case of not turning left, the person is expected to, or would hopefully be able, to actually turn left. And as you can imagine, that would evoke tremendous anx ety. And yet to tolerate that anxiety. Now i want to be very clear, this is not the sort of thing you want to do on your own. This is not the sort of thing you want to do for a friend. This is done by trained, licensed psychologists and psychiatrists. But none the less, it really points to the fact that, as a anxiety related disorder, oset is distinct from other types of anxiety. And anxiety related disorders, things like p t s d and panic disorder, et cetera. Because the goal, again, is to bring the person right up close to the thing that they fear the most, and then to interrupt the circuit.</blockquote>

Thoughts are not as bad as actions. One of the rules that people with o c d seem to adopt for themselves is that thoughts are really truly the equivalent of actions. So they'll have an intrusive thought. And we haven't spent too much time on this to day, but earlier i touched on the fact that some of the intrusive thoughts that people have in o c d are really disturbing. They can be really gross, or at least gross to that person. They can imagery that is, you know, toxic or infectious, or is highly sexualized in a way that is disturbing to them. Can be very taboo.

One of the powerful elements of treatment for o c d is to really support the patient and make them realize that thoughts are just thoughts, and that everyone has disturbing thoughts, and that oftentimes those disturbing thoughts arise at the most inconvenient and sometimes what seems like the most inappropriate circumstances. And this relates to a whole larger discussion that we could have about what are thoughts and why do they surface?

#### ‚ú® Summary
The big difference between a thought and an action is that the nervous system is, in one case, not translating those patterns of thinking into motor sequences. That nirty way of saying thoughts aren't actions can be helpful for people if they really think about it. They're not thinking and feeling this stuff because they're bad or evil. And of course, sometimes this can cross over with othe other elements of life where we place moral judgment on people for certain behaviours. I think that's part of a healthy society, of course. That's what makes us who we are.

Doctor blair simpson's lab has at least one study exploring the role of mindfulness, meditation for the treatment of o c d. Thereare, the data are a little bit u complicated, and i should mention that good things are happening, at least in the united states, probably elsewhere as well. But good things are happening in terms of the exploration of things like meditation and other, let's call them, non traditional or holistic forms of treatment for psychi atric disorders, because of the division of complementary health that's now been launched by the national institutes of health. So whereas before people would think about a meditation, or yoganidra, or even cbd supplementation for that matter, as kind of fringe, maybe, or kind of woo, or a non traditional the very least, the national institutes of health in the united states has now devoted an entire division, an entire institute, purely for the exploration of things like breathing practices, meditation, et cetera. So there's a cancer institute, there's a hearing and deafness institute. There's a vision institute. And now there's this complementary health tute, which i think is a wonderful addition to the more traditional aspects of medicine. I think no possible, useful treatment should be overlooked or unresearched, in my opinion, provided that can be done safely.</blockquote>

A going back to inosital and its current use, or i should say, my current use, i've been taking 900 milligrams of anosital as an addition to my existing tool kit for sleep, which ive talked about many times on this podcast and other podcast. Consists of magnesium three and eight, apigenin and theonine. If you want to know more about that kit, you can go to our news letter, nerell network news letter, huberman lab dot com. The tool kit for sleep is there you don't even have to sign up for the news letter, but it'll give you a flavor of the sorts of things that are in the news letter. In any case, i've been a experimenting a bit a with taking 900 milligrams of myo inosital, either alone or combination with that sleep kid. And i must say, the sleep i've been getting on in osital is extremely deep a and does seem to lead to enhanced levels of focus and alertness during the day. And perhaps you're noticing that cause i'm talking more quickly on this podcast than os potcats. Know, i'm just kidding. I don't think the two things re lad in any cond of causal way. The point here is that inosital is known to be pretty effective in reducing anxiety, but when taken at very high dosages. Can it do the same at low dosages? We don't know. I would consider 900 milligrams a low dose most of the given the fact that most of the studies of anocital have explored very high dosages, like even ten or 12 grams per day, which i must say, seems exceedingly high.</blockquote>

However, the individuals with obsessive compulsive personality disorder, they discounted the value of delayed gratifications significantly less than those with obsessive compulsive disorder. What do i mean? They are both impairing disorders that are marked by compulsive behaviours. Here iam paraphrasing, but they can be differentiated by the presence of obsessions in o c d. So obsessions in o cd, people with o c d are absolutely fixated on certain ideas, and those ideas are intrusive. Again, that's the hall mark theme. And by an excessive capacity to delay reward in obsessive compulsive personality disorder. That is, people who have excessive compulsive personality disorder are really good at delaying gratification. So they are able to concentrate very intensely and perform very intensely in ways that allow them to instil order such that they can delay rewards. Now you can see why this contour of</blockquote>

And there's some fascinating research on superstitions. One particular study that i'm a big fan of is the work of benslevski at harvard. He studies motor sequences and motor learning. And he as beautiful data on how people learn, for instance, a tennis swing, and the patterns that they engage in early on, and then the patterns of swinging that they swing in the racket, that is, that they engage in later as they acquire more skill. And basically the take away is that the amount of error, or variation from swing to swing is dramatically reduced as they acquire skill. That's all fine and good, and there's some beautiful, a mechanistic data that he and others have discovered to support how that comes to be. But they also explore animal models, in particular, rats pressing sequences of buttons and levers to obtain a reward.</blockquote>

If you watch closely, oftentimes there are components in the motor sequence which are completely unrelated to the pitch. Similarly, rats that have been trained to hit two vers and step on a pedal with their left hind foot will do that to gain a piece of food. In other words, you could eliminate certain components of the motor sequence and it would not matter. The rat would still get the pellet, the pitcher would still be able to pitch. And yet that persist.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And yet that persist. If you've ever watched a game of baseball, you've seen this before. Oftentimes the pitcher up on the mound will bring the ball to their chin, they'll look over their shoulder, they'll look back over the other shoulder, and then they will, of course, reel back and pitch the ball. But if you watch closely, oftentimes there are components in the motor sequence which are completely unrelated to the pitch. They are not looking necessarily to see if someone stealing a base. They're not necessarily looking down at home plate where the batter is. They're doing things like touching the back of their ear before they bring the ball to their chin, or adjusting their hat. And if you watch individual pitchers, what you'll find is that they'll do the same sequence of completely irrelevant motor patterns before each and every single pitch. Similarly, rats that have been trained to, for instance, hit two vers and step on a pedal with their left hind foot and then tap a button up above that is the red button, will do that to gain a piece of food. But sometimes they'll also introduce a pattern into that motor sequence where they will shake their tail a little bit, or they'll turn their head a little bitt, or they'll move their ears bit, et cetera, motor patterns that have nothing to do with obtaining the particular outcome in mind. In other words, you could eliminate certain components of the motor sequence and it would not matter. The rat would still get the pellet, the pitcher would still be able to pitch.</blockquote>

But sometimes they'll also introduce a pattern into that motor sequence where they will shake their tail a little bit, or they'll turn their head a little bitt, or they'll move their ears bit, et cetera, motor patterns that have nothing to do with obtaining the particular outcome in mind. In other words, you could eliminate certain components of the motor sequence and it would not matter. The rat would still get the pellet, the pitcher would still be able to pitch. And yet, that get introduced because somehow, because they were performed again and again prior to successful trials, the rat, or the human baseball pitcher, comes to believe in some way that it was involved in generating the outcome. Hence, superstition, right? I confess i have a few superstitions. I occasionally will knock on wood. I'll say something that i want to happen, and i'ls say, will knock on wood, and i'll just do it. And occasionally i'll challenge myself and thi don't want to knock. Don't knock on wood. Andrew, don't do that. You don't know. And i don't think anyone wants to be superstitious. I certainly don't. And so every oncein a while i'll just challenge it, and i won't actually knock on wood. I'm admitting this to you to kind of am gets normalize some of this.</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
Superstitions can become full blown compulsions and obsessions when we repeat them often enough that they become automatic. Superstitions are beliefs that we, on an individual scale, come to believe are linked to the probability of an outcome. In fact, we know in our rational minds, they have no real relationship to the outcome.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>They really come to believe that if they don't knock on wood, that something terrible is going to happen, maybe something in particular. Or in the case of the baseball pitcher, they come to believe that if they don't touch their right ear before they reel back on the pitch, that the pitch won't be any good, or that they're going to lose the game. I don't know what their thought process is. Now i also don't know what the rat is thinking, but the rat is clearly doing something, or thinking something, is related to the final outcome. I don't know of any studies where they've intervened with the particular superstition, like behaviors of the rat, to see whether or not the rat somehow doesn't continue to do the motor sequence to get the pellet. We don't know ther rats. I don't speak rat. Most people don't. Or if you speak to a rat, if it speaks, is not in english. Wy, the point is that superstitions are beliefs that we, on an individual scale, come to believe are linked to the probability of an outcome, when in fact, we know, we actually know in our rational minds, they have no real relationship to the outcome. Superstitions can become full blown compulsions and obsessions when we repeat them often enough that they become automatic. And i think this is what we observe most of the time when we see a pitcher touching their ear. Or, for instance, in tennis, you see the al see someone the they'll slap their shoes. Often i see this, they'ly slap the undersides of their souls.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The United States is suffering from an epidemic of tragic gun violence. While a political debate rages around the topic of gun control, it remains important to understand the causes and possible remedies for gun violence within the current system. Andrew Papachristos is a sociologist who uses applied network science to study patterns of street violence in urban areas. His research shows that such violence is highly non-random; knowing something about the social networks of perpetrators and victims can help identify who might be at heightened risk of gun violence. It‚Äôs an interesting example of applying ideas from mathematics and computer science to real-world social situations.<br/> Support Mindscape on Patreon . <br/> Andrew Papachristos received his Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Chicago. He is currently a professor of sociology at Northwestern University, and a faculty fellow at the Institute for Policy Research. He is also founding director of the Northwestern Neighborhoods and Networks Initiative.<br/> Web site Northwestern web page Google Scholar publications Wikipedia Twitter <br/> See Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info .</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
It's important to distinguish at least three of these types. One is intimate partner violence, the other two are mass shootings and gun homicides. Intimate partner violence happens behind closed doors, so we often don't hear about it. Largest volume of gun homicides occurs in public places like shopping malls or schools.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But when it comes to homicides, which we have better data on, not perfect data, you know, there are different types and, and, you know, it's important to distinguish at least three of these types. One one is, of course, our course, mass shootings, spree shootings, the kinds we see that are going around the country, again, right now. And you know, as we're seeing an infant shopping malls and schools a and theirs are quite distinct from other two real types. One is intimate partner violencewhich is, again, extremely serious, but very different sort than the third, which is the lion's share of gun homicides, which is essentially assault, assaults, people that know each other, arguments, disputes. And that's commonly, that's kind of what shows up on the front page more often than not. And part of the reason it gets more attention, besides its the volume, the largest volume of gun homicides, is oftentimes it's public, right?

The majority of gun micides are these assault of interactions, essentially. It sounds like usually, if it's not a man, shooting is by some one whom they know or have some connection with in some more abstract way. Two thirds that we know of are by people that are known to the person who was injured or killed. And the other third we actually just don't know. A siwes don't know who did it. Ah, and by the way, your enemy is often not a stranger. The person whom you got into fight with is oftenNot a stranger.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So you said, you seemed to say man mentioning assault of violence against people who you know, or in a rival gang, or something like that. I does that category also include if someone robs a bank and it goes terribly wrong and they kill somebody? Ye</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>would. It would actually include them. That happens much more rarely then wit former, of course, a, you know, the could be even a thirda fourth category of state violence, especially those shot by police. And then again, of course, you branch off into, was it the commission of a crime? You know, was it a traffic stop? Was it a mistaken identity? Was it intentional a but in that case, again, those are smaller portions of the total. The majority of gun micides are these assault of interactions, essentially. So imean, so that already tells us something thata, when there is going to be and an assault of homicide,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>or rather, let's us broaden it, when some one is killed with a gun by another person. It sounds like usually, if it's not a man, shooting is by some one whom they know or have some connection with in some more abstract way. That's</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>right. I mean, so this idea of stranger homicide is is actually quite rare.

#### ‚ú® Summary
In communities that have high levels of gun violence, generally the victims and potential perpetrators are in a network of a couple hundred peoplerit. Depending on the city or neighborhood, a couple thousand people. In our study of boston, 85 % of all fatal, non-fatal shootings happened in anetwork of 700 people. And it turns out, what we ndin chicago in general, but during this three weeks period, was that your probability of being a victim is directly related to how many people around you are getting shot.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And here we've studied chicago and boston and oakland and new york and newark and cincinnati and new orleans and even evanston, which is where northwestern lives. And we've noticed a pattern that is consistent, which is gun violence concentrates in very, very small social networks. Even in communities that have high levels of gun violence or experience high levels of gun violence, generally, the victims and potential perpetrators of shooting are in a network of a couple hundred peoplerit, or, depending on the city or neighborhood, a couple thousand people. So in our study of boston, 85 % of all fatal, non fatal shootings happened in a network of 700 people, less than four % of this community's population. And in chicago, when we did the whole city of chicago, again, less than four %, about 75 % of the fatal and non fatal shootings. And when i'm talking about networks here, i'm talking about instances where people were either engaging in a crime together, or arrested together, or were co involved in an event that elicited some system response. But we can think of it broadly as the people you hang out with a the people that hang out with that would have your back in a fight, am ar, tend to be your network. And it turns out, what we ndin chicago in general, but during this three weeks period, was that your probability of being a victim is directly related to how many people around you are getting shot. So if your friends, if you're in parts of a network where victimizations are happening, your probability sky rockets.</blockquote>

There are more guns in chicago than there are in new york or la. Part of that is not necessarily the city's gun laws or the states, but our proximity to states like indiana,. The continued dominance of a a political machine system keeps crime in some neighborhoods and not in other neighborhoods.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>However, you know, to answer your question, chicago, i would say, to day, the best comparison would be los angeles in the 19 nineties. You know, some of the things that keep ago's homicide rate higher than its peers, and it often gets kits compared to chi a, new york and ele a has to do wih with the levels and the size of the city. What keeps chicago unique? A, one of the things, outside of segregation, racest housing policies and all the things that kind of cre neighborhoods that have high crime rates and keepin that way, is its history of gangs in this city, which is um fundamentally different than some of those other cities. L a had a similar history, as did new york, but their gangs didn't, a, grow as big and as pervasive as chicagos in terms of the level of organization and polit politicaliation. And that still lingers to this day, am guns. Chicago recovers more guns. There are more guns in chicago than there are in new york or la. And part of that is a, not necessarily the city's gun laws or the states, but our proximity to states like indiana, which is where a second largest source of guns come from, which is, is largely a cash and carry state. And the two other ones, which are really important, and there are others, one is the continued dominance of a a political machine system, which is slowly changed over time, but, you know, that's part of what keeps crime in some neighborhoods and not in other neighborhoods. It creates the boundaries, you know, almost criminological jerry mandering. Ah, you know, in a sense where, i'm going to actually write that one down in us. Gi like, but it's, it's pretty much what you have, like, if you'rea powerful ward boss, you can get services, cops will come, you know, they will do sweeps and serve warrants. And the last thing, which is so important in chicago is, of course, the utter lack of im using the word reform broadly, but like, change in policing in this city.

There are 900 crews in chicago, there are probably a handful that are actively involved in some organized stuff. And so the danger when it comes to policy, is that you treat those 895 or 885 as if they were alcapon, right? Or the gangster disciples of the nineties, or whatever the case might be. Most groups are these sort of side corner groups. The history is there, and it's tied to a very specific place that's been segregated and locked up and locked out for generations.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So great questions. So when i'm talking the networks are created through ances of coarest or being stopped together by the police. So it is actually setting aside anything around culpability. It's an observation made by police a point in time and space. Um, you know, there are biases in police data which are important. We're able to see a lot of those. So, say, failure to comply, often is something that's officer base. Robbery, assault, arson, things like that, tend to be come to the attention of police from civilians. So we take all those things to account. But basically, if you and i somebody together, we have a tie. And then if i, you know, committ an assault with somebody else, we have a tie. And you string these things together, and it creates actually, a network of of a risky behaviors, right? Things that are inherently you and i engaging in a behavior that could be risky. So, but your comment about victim and suspect, or people that are involved. M, i focus mainly on victims. One, because in chicago we have abysmally low clearance rates. But more to the point, violence prevention is about saving lives. And focusing on ho's in harm's way, who is experiencing trama, is the kind of most immediately actionable information. And we generally have all the information about who was injured. And from a public health standpoint, it shouldn't matter whether you have a felany conviction, or, you know, our bad parent, or you dropped out o none of that should matter if you're focusing on saving somebody's life.</blockquote>

You mention the police and public health entities. There's a third one, which i'm working with, which are community base entities. U police have used these technologies and sort of approaches, and it hasn't gone extremely well. And it hasn't gone extremely well because they've done, typically what police do, they get some print out, they make a list, and they do what cops do, which is they work a listand whoever's on the top of the list is number one, and whosever number two is number two.</blockquote>

Only say, you and i, you know, robbed somebody together. But then simers think, n let me tell you. Jahn and andy played football together, and john used to date andy's sister, and then they broke up, and then he hung out. All of a sudden the context becomes important. And you only get that by engaging local experts, good preachers, teachers, cops, outreach workers, social workers. They know a community, or they should know a community. That's what makes this information actionable. And that's what didn't happen in some bofthye's instances. Like, if you're just working a list, you don't care whether shawn's already got a job and turned his life around. He's on the list. Like, right? What similarities are we seeing in these networks?

#### ‚ú® Summary
iC tests are the most powerful technology that research psychologists have ever invented by a large margin. The american military decided, i believe, all three branches, and i believe this was in the 19 eighties, that it was illegal to induct someone into the armed forces if they had an ece of less than 82. That's ten per cent of the population. And that is a dismal statistic, because the military is chronically hungry for people. If their conclusion after close to 100 years of icu testing was that 10 % of the population can't be trained to do anything of any utility in the military that has, well, that speaks for itself,.

And so if we ed them in some metaphoricl sense to surgery, we might say, well, you don't want surgery. Might be necessary, but you don't want to do it without an anaesthetic, and you also want to be aware that the scalpel can kill. And so i think partly what we're wrestling with is that, among many other things, is the fact that these tests are of credible power in terms of their predictive ability. And were not exactly sure what to do with that. Mean, when i started familiarizing myself with the i c literature, it was actually quite disheartening in some sense, because i started to understand just how broad the ability range among human beings is, and how intractable that is in some measures, in the lower, let's say, tenth so one stat i came across at one point, and you detailed the use of icu tests by the american military.

i think part of the problem is terminology. Part of what makes people resistant to this, because we also tend to sort of casually talk about elite institutions which in clo implies a kind of moral valuing. And that's really a catastrophe. Just because you're smart, doesn't mean you're good. It doesn't means you're wise or meritorious. Doesn't even necessarily mean your decisions are going to be better than those other people would make using other means.

Right? And all those assumptions are questionable and a right, iann they're not natural kinds, which is partly what you're pointing out. And to and then, ok, so all right, so l except that, let's, let's go to the other side of this for a minute. So part of the problem, i think, is terminology. Part of what makes people resistant to this, because we also tend to sort of casually talk about elite institutions, which in clo implies a kind of moral valuing. We talk about meritocracy, which implies that the people at the top are of greater merit, right? And that means, to the degree that maritocracy is established on the basis of, let's say, fluid intelligence, that we're conflacting moral worth with abstract intellectual ability. And that's really a catastrophe. And that's part of the pride of intellect. And you talked about, ah, the best and the brightest and, and one of the criticism that that book levelled against the meritocracy was precisely one of intellectual pretension and arrogance, right? It's, just because you're smart, doesn't mean you're good. It doesn't mean you're wise, it doesn't mean you're meritorious. It doesn't even necessarily mean that the decisions you make are going to be better than decisions other people would make using other means. Now, it's complicated, because, as you point out in the book, it's quite likely, if you're in the top, let's say, tenth of the ic distribution, and you start poor, that you won't end up poor. We're right. And so i believe, i read a paper at one point that suggested that you were much better off in the united states if you were born in the top cortil of ic than if you werent born in the top cortile of wealth.

And so it i struggled for about a year and a half to find a volunteer job.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>it turns out, you know, volunteer jobs are actually harder to get in many ways than paying jobs now, because there's so many police checks and that sort of thing you have to go through, and they're very technically challenging. I sent him to a government agency that that was hypothetically designed to help people like him find a job, and they said, you know, type up your resume and send it out. It's like, well, he can't type, and he doesn't have a resume and he can't use a computer, and that's not helpful. Thank you very much. You have no idea what you're dealing with here. And so this ten % of the population, let's say, the liberals think you can train anyone to do anything, which is rubbish. And the conservatives think if you work hard enough, there's no obstacles to your success. And that's also rubbish in some situations, because hard work alone isn't going to do it. And so we have a real conundrum. Now what we're doing right now, i think, is shooting the messenger. It's like we don't want to hear this, so we'll get rid of tests that are valid and reliable.</blockquote>

And i think that what we're saying in britain at the moment, which is very interesting, i think, is that we've had a series of a schools which are called academies a, which a a bit like american magnet schools, but they're schools that can select people at the age of 16, once they've done their own levels, when they're going to a levels. Theres a lot of them in the east end of london, in poorer parts of other cities. And we found that these schools, which have been very academically rigorous, very focused on achievement, have been designed to say that if you've a poor population, what you need to do to it is to give it opportunity and give it rigor, rather than a sort of dumb down education. And these schools have been extremely good at getting members of ethnic minorities into high quality universities. So there's one called brampton manor academy in the east end of london, which has an ethnic minority dominant population, which has the majority of its students have free school meals, which is a measure of poverty.

In the u k thon we have a los of the currents that you have in the united states, but in a sort of weaker way. The attitude that men are people who do things with their hands is perfectly useful when you're in industrial society. And there's plenty of honor in that as well. So it's not easy for that to be replaced when that was the basis of productive effort itself and of success. But i think both the new tories and the old labor people can agree that, you now the old aristocratic alet, there's something wrong with them.

There is no evidence that group membership produces diversity of the sort that would actually broaden the human scope of any discussion. And there is not a lot of racial difference in temperament. We know there are other sources of variability. There's variability in temperament, five dimensions. It emerged out of pure brute force statistics. That's where the diver city lies. But i don't think that's a biased finding in it it was, it was agnostic theoretically.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Thats, yes, there's no evidence for that. That's wrong, technically wrong? Well, it's partly wrong because, look, we could talk about want ed. One of the arguments you lay out in your book that certain psychologists, and they tend to be educational psychologists, have levied against, ah, strict maritocrotic tests like those that are fundamentally ic tests. So that would be the s a t, the g ore all everything that's used for for entrance into undergraduate universities, where that's used in graduate school, professional schools, that'sall ic testing, essentially. And people will say it's not, but that's cause they don't know what they're talking about. I casso. Then you might say, well, ice's pretty singular and's pretty good predictor of long term success in a cognitively complex society. But there are other sources of variance, possibly. So you get thinkers like robert sternberg, for example, who talked about practical intelligence, and a the multiple intelligence theorist, howard gardiner, and both of whose scientific work i think is shoddy, beyond beyond comprehension, and a terrible answer to a problem that's been answered actually quite nicelysc ally. We know there are other sources of variability. There's variability in temperament, five dimensions. That's a lot, five dimensions. And i don't think that's a biased finding in it it was, it was agnostic theoretically. It emerged out of pure brute force statistics. That's where the diver city lies. And there is not a lot of racial difference in temperament. So the idea that group membership produces diversity of a sort that would actually broaden the human scope of any discussion, any corporation, et cetera, et cetera, is just wrong. There is no evidence for it. Whatever. It's even worse than that, because it makes the presumption that the essential source of diversity is, in fact, ethnicity in race. And that can go wrong very badly.</blockquote>

i retired myself from my gougl search analytics and read every academic study i could find on big life decisions. The overarching lesson is that it's incredibly hard to predict who makes someone happy. You would think that, like many qualities about a person would dramatically improve the odds they make you happy. It seems in the datas, there are some things that moderately improve the odds, but they're not that big.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yes, i basly just read, i kind of retired myself from my gougl search analytics and read every academic study i could find on big life decisions and what is the date to tell us and present that as trying to help people make better life decisions. The motive, one of the motivations of this is, amost a huge baseball fan. We talked about mony ball, and i kind of realize that baseball has changed so much, i since due to the mony ball revolution. When i was a kid, the game of baseball looked different, like the infielders all stood in the same spot in every play. And now every play the infielders are all over the place. There's something he infield shift, which data scientists discovered was actually a better way. It looks insane, but you put most the infielders on one side of the field, it actually leads to better outcomes. And iwas think about, like, our personal lives, and i feel like most of us don't really use data driven, make data driven decisions. We generally do what feels about right and go with our gut s a kind what would a a data, what w would a data driven a life be like? And i think the area where there's the clearest and the monyball analogy extends best is dating a. So tha, there have been studies. There's a work by samantha joel where she studied 11 thousand romantic couples. And she had, ever she worked with 85 other scientists. She had every possible trait you could measure on them, their sexual tastes, their demographics, their values a, their physical appearance, as ranked by other people. And she and how happy they reported being in that relationship. And she and the other scientists used machine learning to try to find what is it about a person that predicts ou 're going to be happy in a relationship with them? And the overarching lesson is that it's incredibly hard to predict who makes someone happy. Like it's shockingly unpredictable. You would think that, like many qualities about a person would dramatically improve the odds they make you happy. And it seems in the datas, it's there are some things that moderately improve the odds, but they're not that big. And the striking thing about that study is you contrast that with scholars have studied on line dating, and they've mined through, you know, everybody's cliques and messages, and they saya what makes someone desirable in on line dating. And that is incredibly easy to predict. So its it. It may be hard to predict who's a good romantic partner, but it is so easy to predict who's desirable partner. In fact, they can even predict with high accuracy, not just whether you'r going to swipe left or right, but how long it's going to take you to swipe left or right. O if someone's close to your barometer, it's going to take you a little bit longer to make that decision.</blockquote>

It explains conventionally attractive people a way more desirable.

There's there's this idea that people are drawn to opposites. It's totally not true. On just about every dimension scholars can measure, people are drawn to people who are similar themselves, even on silk seemly silly things like how many photos you include in your profile.

#### ‚ú® Summary
I do not think that the fiat currencies end up going away for my lifetime. What i think will end up happening is people will digitize them, and start to understand how to send Fiat value across the bit coin rails. And ultimately the digitization of currency will coexist with coin as additional currency. I just think that the incumbents are going to hold on for as long as they can.

So for a currency to completely disappear is very difficult. And so i think that what we ultimately will watch happen is bikin will continue to rise. It will be established as a global ore value. I do not think that the fiat currencies end up going away for my lifetime. What i think will end up happening is people will digitize them, and will start to understand how to send fiat value across the bit coin rails. And so then all of a sudden you start using bit coin as a payment rail to send fiat currencies. And ultimately the digitization of fiat currencies will coexist with coin as additional currency. I just think that the incumbents are going to hold on for as long as they can. And similar to how bill gates said, you know, you cannot over estimate what you can do in one year and under estimate what you can do in ten, i think that we drastically underestimate just how long a government can hold on to a failing currency. And we also probably overestimate how quickly people are willing to throw their hands up with their existing currency and move over a hundred % to a new</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>ni.

I would hve said, what adoption cycle? No, i don't get it yet, right? And nobody else gets it yet either. We are very obviously now in the adoption cycle, but that cycle takes a while.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In this episode, my guest is Dr. David Buss, Professor of Psychology at the University of Texas, Austin, and one of the founding members of the field of evolutionary psychology.<br/> Dr. Buss describes his work on how people select mates for short and long-term relationships, the dynamics of human courtship, and mate value assessment ‚Äî meaning how people measure up as potential partners. We also discuss the causes of infidelity and differences for infidelity in men and women. He explains how people evaluate and try to alter other people‚Äôs mate value as a means to secure and even poach mates. We discuss monogamous and non-monogamous relationships in humans. And we discuss what Dr. Buss calls ‚Äúthe dark triad‚Äù‚Äî features common in stalkers and narcissists that relate to sexual and psychological violence in relationships.<br/> This episode is sure to be of interest to anyone single or in a relationship who seeks to know how people select mates and anyone who is interested in forming and maintaining healthy romantic partnerships.<br/> ¬†<br/> Thank you to our sponsors:<br/> <br/> ROKA - https://www.roka.com - code "huberman" <br/> InsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman ¬† <br/> Headspace - https://www.headspace.com/specialoffer ¬† <br/>  ¬†<br/> Our Patreon page:<br/> <br/> https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman ¬†   ¬†<br/> Supplements from Thorne:<br/> <br/> https://www.thorne.com/u/huberman ¬†   ¬†<br/> Social:<br/> <br/> Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab ¬† <br/> Twitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab ¬† <br/> Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab ¬† <br/> Website - https://hubermanlab.com ¬† <br/> Newsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network ¬† <br/>  ¬†<br/> Links:<br/> <br/> Dr. Buss' New Book "When Men Behave Badly" - https://amzn.to/3FThTsG ¬† <br/> Dr. Buss' Website at University of Texas, Austin - https://labs.la.utexas.edu/buss/david-buss/ ¬† <br/> Dr. Buss' Twitter - https://twitter.com/ProfDavidBuss ¬† <br/>  ¬†<br/> Timestamps:<br/> <br/> 00:00:00 Introducing Dr. David Buss <br/> 00:04:10 Sponsors: ROKA, InsideTracker, Headspace <br/> 00:08:33 Choosing a Mate <br/> 00:13:40 Long Term Mates: Universal Desires <br/> 00:18:31 What Women The Evolution of Desire, Textbooks <br/> 02:10:42 Concluding Statements, Zero-Cost Support: Subscribe, Sponsors, Patreon, Thorne <br/>  ¬†<br/> Please note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

<blockquote>"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal." Those words, penned by Thomas Jefferson 246 years ago, continue to inspire many Americans. And yet they were written by a man who owned hundreds of enslaved people, and fathered six children by an enslaved woman. This week, as we prepare to mark Independence Day in the United States, we revisit our 2018 conversation with Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Annette Gordon-Reed . We talk about the contradictions in Jefferson's life ‚Äî and how those contradictions resonate in our own lives.¬†<br/> If you like this show, be sure to check out our other work, including our recent episode about the power of subtraction. <br/> Also, check out our new podcast, My Unsung Hero !

#### ‚ú® Summary
In the movies 17 76, there's a scene that shows jefferson debating the issue with edward rutledge. I asked anetwh the scene is historically accurate. Was jefferson prevented from getting anti slavery language into the declaration of independence because he himself was personally compromised as a slaveholder? It wasn't about jefferson's ownership of slaves that made them excise this. People thought it was not the thing to do at this moment,. So better to just leave that passage out. And they took it out.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 8</b><br/><br/>Jefferson</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>tried to push america in the direction of this better society. As he was writing the declaration of independence, he ac used briton's king george of perpetuating the international slave trade, what jefferson called execrable commerce. This reference to a detestable practice was removed from the final version of the declaration. In the movies 17 76, there's a scene that shows jefferson debating the issue with edward rutledge, a member of the continental congress from south carolina.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 7</b><br/><br/>I tell you, the rights of human nature are deeply wounded by this infamous practicean see to your own wounds, mister jefferson. For you are a practitioner, are you not? I</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>asked anetwh the scene is historically accurate. Was jefferson prevented from getting anti slavery language into the declaration of independence because he himself was personally compromised as a slaveholder? I</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>don't think he was prevented because of his involvement in slavery. It was taken out because people thought it was too in dary. It offended members of the death south. So it wasn't about jefferson's ownership of slaves that made them excise this. It was that people thought it was not the thing to do at this moment, that it was too incendiary, that it was a mark against people who were slaveholders, all slaveholders. So better to just leave that passage out. And they took it out. And he was very, very angry about that and other changes that they made to to the draft.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So when jefferson and folks like him were angry, was part of their reasoning, you know, we really want this end, but it's more important for us to all in a hole together, because we're actually fighting this revolutionary war, and that's the more important goal that has to be accomplished first, before we can get to this secondary goal of basically abolishing slavery.</blockquote>

When jefferson went to paris in 17 84, he took a man named james hemmings with him. So there was some tension here, because france, at the time, was in resounding with the cries of liberty and equality. But once ames takes over the roll as the chef de grisine, he begins to pay him. He handles it by treating james as if he were a regular servant, and instead of an enslaved person.

Government. When</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>jefferson went to paris, he took a man named james hemmings, who was a tenager, 18, 19 years old at the time. And he took james with him to have james trained as a chef, a french chef.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So there was some tension here, because france, of course, at the time, was in resounding with the cries of liberty and equality. And jefferson, in some ways, embraced french revolutionary fervor. But how did he manage that embrace of the revolution with the slaves he had in his own household?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>The way he handled enslaved people? And our james hemmings, when he was in france, had much more to do with french law, which at the time, was on the side of the enslaved person. I mean, people who petitioned for freedom in france, people who had been brought the colonies and so forth, or other enslaved people who were brought there from other places who petitioned for freedom, had those petitions granted routinely. So when he's there with james hemmings, he knows that it's possible that james might at some point petition for his freedom. So he handles, i think, although he doesn't say this, but this is the time when he begins to pay james hemming's regular wages. James becomes the chef de cuisine at the hotel de langiac, jefferson's residence. Before he had been giving james spending money or gratuities. But once ames takes over the roll as the chef de grisine, he begins to pay him. So i think he handles it by treating james as if he were a regular servant, and instead of an enslaved person.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Jefferson's wife had died by the time he got to france. At one point, a young slave is brought over from the united states. She is actual the sister of robert hemmings, who was by his side as he drafted the declaration of independence. Who was she and what did she become to jefferson? Well,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>sally hemmings, sarah, a nicknamed sally, was sister to robert annd james. She had been something of a companion to jefferson's so she went along, and she was 14. And while she was there, we don't know when she became jeffersons. And their son says, concubine is the term that he uses. And she became pregnant by jefferson, and she wanted to stay in france. By the time jefferson ink that he wants to come home, she wanted to stay. And actually, all the young people in the hotel de langiac wanted to stay in france. Nobody wanted to go home. But jefferson promised her that if she came back with him, she would have a good life at montecallo, and their children would be freed when they were 21 years old. So she agreed to that. She was 16 years old at the time, and she came back to virginia with jefferson.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So for us, at least with the vantage of history, this seems almost incomprehensible as a decision. Why would you give up essentially freedom in france to come back and be a slave in virginia? I</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>thought about quite a bit when i wrote my first book. That was sort of a point of mystery for me, about sally hemmings. But when i started writing the hemmings o monticello and working on that, and i realized how important family was or i began to think about how important family would have been to some one like that, a 16 year old female raised to believe that she had some special connection to family. In a way, to think about family, think about your mother is back in virginia. Her sisters and brothers were there. So that would be an impetus an that was sort of a dilemma that many slave people faced. Do you run away and have freedom by yourself, or do you stay and stick it out with your family? The other thing to consider is that jefferson treated sally hemmings and her sisters and brothers very differently than he did the other aves on the mountain.</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
The idea that a man would have a mistress or a companion was normal in virginia. A one of jefferson's friends said it was a common practice for a widowed or bachelor slave owners to take an enslaved woman as, and he uses the phrase, a substitute for a wife. mixed children, these kinds of connections from rape, two sort of long terme liaisons, however you want to call them, were a part of slave societies.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Well, because he was the patriarch of montecallo. And in those days, it was much more than father knows best what he said would go, because he was the head of the household. I think it is also important to remember that jefferson had two surviving daughters with his wife, who died in 17 82. So i think he handled it by being the boss, and it was the kind of thing that people would not question. So he had basically the freedom to impose a kind of order on this place that everybody went along with. Plus, you have to remember, i think we have to remember, that he wasn't married. And the idea that a man would have a mistress or a companion, or that he would have a set up like this, was normal in virginia. It was not considered crazy. A one of jefferson's friends that it was a common practice for a widowed or bachelor slave owners to take an enslaved woman as, and he uses the phrase, a substitute for a wife. Obviously, she couldn't be a wife, because they couldn't marry black people. And white people could not get married. Well, until 19 67, in virginia. So that was out of the question. But this was something that happened in slavery, an it's hard for us to wrap our minds around, just as it might be hard for us to wrap our minds around about slavery in general. But mixed children, these kinds of connections from rape, two sort of long terme liaisons, however you want to call them, were a part of slave societies. And they have been in every slave society that has ever existed.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And while he was thinking about this, he read a number of books about changes in pris the way that people dealt with prisoners in penitentiaries. And the idea was incentives worked better than after the fact punishments. So in the 17 nineties, when he sets up a nail factory run by boys, typically, and older tean agers. He institutes a regime of tives, that they would get extra rations for food, they would get extra clothes. Sometimes they would get money. They were paid gratuities. So this notion of incentives versus punishment or whipping, was something that became a part of his way of making himself a quot better slaveholder. And that's the thing he tried to foster which made him more comfortable in his role as a master.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>In many ways. I think it's hard to read your book without at least reading into it the possibility that jefferson had, at least in his own mind, something approaching an intimate relationship with sally hemmings, that it was not just master and slave. Of course, a lot of people have criticized you for this. She was a slave. She could not have given consent. How have you come to understand the relationship between jefferson and sally hemmings? You</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>know, i go back and forth on this. I don't believe that every relationship between an enslaved woman and a master was exactly the same. I think there were diffe types of connections. And jefferson, to me, shows signs of having been attached to sally hemmings. I have no problem saying that, because there are no stories about him with any other woman when he comes back from france, you know, ever. But her, we don't know about her, because once she gets back here, she is totally under his power.</blockquote>

The number one mistake of leading change is that we try to change things with information. When leaders paint a vivid, emotionally evocative picture of their visions, people are more likely to commit to them. John ter says most people think that the way change happens is three steps, analyzed, think change. The way it works is, see, feel change. People see something that makes them feel something, motivated, surprised, appalled and that sparks the change.

Instead of lecturing students all at once from the front of the classroom, teachers create their own instructional vidios for lessons. Students can then access the vidios from anywhere, any time to work through the less os at their own pace. And since teachers aren't busy lecturing, they're free to support students one on one.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>This was the biggest revelation of my teaching career, because it freed me up to be truly responsive to every individual human in my class room.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Emily wanted to bring the model to other class rooms, but it was a major change to the way things had always been done in schools, and there was plenty of resistance. Teachers</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 5</b><br/><br/>were sceptical. Parents were sceptical.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Even her own students were sceptical. To convince them, emily applied the three steps. First, she created an emotional image of why change had to happen. Teachers were exhausted. Teacher</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>burn out and teacher attricion was huge for me and my messaging to them coming out of cove it, teachers were tired. If we don't change something, we're all going to quit. We won't be healthy humans if something doesn't shift. It</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>wasn't just the teachers who needed change. Students needed it desperately too. They were zoning out in some classes and missing others. Altogether, i</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>probably had about half of the students actually show up live. You know, the learning gaps that occurred in the last two and years are really significant. What we need is a model that will help us fill in those gaps and really prevent them from getting larger. So that was kind of how i framed it. Second,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>emily got students and parents on board by appealing to their existing values, their sense of pride and educational excellence and their desire for more personalized instruction.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yes, i thought through very carefully what our students and our parents would want. I think this is a tool that our students need, that our parents need, because, you know, they don't want their students to get behind.</blockquote>

The most important decision we make as leaders is who do we put in positions of power? A mistake i made for too many years was putting too much emphasis on expertis and experience when recruiting somebody. In being clear about our leadership expectations, they had to be non negotiable. And instead of trying to change everyone's values, bert worked to close the gap between their existing values and their daily behaviors. When the ship is sinking, you need to plug the holes, get the ship back in shape and get going.

And that differentiates youen the market place to ihten motivation over and over againlik, i'm not just doing a job. I'm advancing a mission. And those two things obviously feed into attention nicely. And they do that in part through a sense of belongingik, when when the culture is strong, like everybody shares the same values, and also, is passionat about the same values as me. And i can't imagine working anywhere else, because how am i going to find that again? Yes, yes. So how do you create that kind of commitment and build a strong organizational culture? In her research, jenny compared the effects of selection versus socialization. How much of culture is who you let on the bus versus how you drive it?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>It turns out that people are, within some parometers, pretty, pretty flexible in terms of how much they can grow to adapt and fit with, or even appreciate the culture that they're a part of. Well,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>i think you just said that socialization eats selection for breakfast. That's right. That's</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>right. Which, which is interesting, because i think if you asked most leaders, they would say it's about about who you hire. And it turns out that people are actually more adaptable than we give them credit for. Jenny</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>finds that when it comes to building a strong culture, socialization beats selection. The values and norms you set are more than twice as influential as who you hire. So if you want to strengthen your culture, the first step is to bring it to life. For people, especially new hires. Culture isn't just communicated through the stories we tell. It's created through the stories we tell. You want to find and share stories about a time when the culture became real.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Stories are vital. I like to advise leaders to see themselves as curators of key stories within organizations. You need to tell the story, but also give the moral of the story.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Stories are vital. I like to advise leaders to see themselves as curators of key stories within organizations. You need to tell the story, but also give the moral of the story. And so one very well known example is southwest airlines. They were running out of money early in their operations. They were using four jets at the time, and they couldn't make their pay roll. So they had to sell one of the jets to pay employees that month. And they went to employees and said, we're going to sell one of our jets, but we want to run the same routes with three jets instead of four. How can we do that? And employees came back with the idea of turning the planes more quickly than they were before. So southwest now continues to be known for its turn time, the amount of time it takes to come back in the gate, unload passen s and bags, you know, clean the plane, reload passengers and bags and take off. And that's part of southwest' sort of deep strategy. So that story got told not just for the substance that turn time is important, but for the relationship between n leaders and employees and who actually came up with the idea. And everyone at southwest knows that story, and it absolutely maps on to the culture that emphasizes both urgency and speed, but also a deep investment and mutual respect between employ s and leaders in the organization. Research</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>reveals that the most powerful stories are about people living your values.

<blockquote>Matt is back this week with his recurring series, ‚ÄòSleep is Bloody Remarkable‚Äô. Today‚Äôs episode is all about why we are unique when it comes to sleep.¬† <br/> When we compare our sleep to that of all other primates, humans stand out in two ways. First, we spend far less time asleep, and second, and in bloody remarkable üòÇ contrast, humans get more than double the amount of REM sleep. <br/> Unlike many other primates, we humans are exclusively ground (or bed!) sleepers. In contrast, primates usually sleep arboreally, meaning in the branches of trees. During REM sleep, to prevent acting out our dreams, the brain paralyzes the body. But this is far too dangerous to do if you are sleeping up in the trees, lest you fall fatally down to earth. <br/> Homo erectus, as the first obligate biped and, with fire to deter predators and blood-sucking insects, was able to sleep fairly safely on the ground. However, fire didn‚Äôt eradicate all the risks. This forced another [bloody] remarkable change: hominids had to become far more efficient in their sleep and thus shorter duration of sleep.¬† <br/> T his re-engineering of human sleep became one of the triggers that rocketed Homo sapiens to the top of the evolutionary pyramid due to REM sleep‚Äôs supercharging of 1) our socioemotional, allowing us to form the cooperative societies that formed the basis of modern civilizations, and 2) cognitive intelligence, particularly our creativity, which was the fuel to our brain-derived engine of ingenuity that helped in the great advances of civilization.¬† <br/> ‚ÄúSimply put: we sleep, therefore, we are.‚Äù¬† <br/> Sleep really is bloody remarkable.¬† <br/> Please note that Matt is not a medical doctor, and none of the content in this podcast should be considered medical advice in any way, shape, or form, nor prescriptive in any way. <br/> One of the sponsors of today s podcast is the biochemical electrolyte drink company LMNT , and they are very kindly offering eight free sample packs when you purchase any one of their orders at drinklmnt.com/mattwalker .

Human sleep sticks out like a proverbial sore thumb in terms of slumber. Compared to old and new world monkeys as well as apes such as chimpanzees and gorillas. We typically average around eight hours relative to somewhere between ten to 15 ous of sleep that we've measured in all other primates.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Hiter, it's mat here again, and welcome back to yet another one of those quirky episodes entitled sleep is bloody remarkable. Nowin last such episode, we spoke at length about one a bloody remarkable thing called half brain sleep. Well, to day is all about the equally remarkable fact that when it comes to dream sleep, we humans are special. And i mean very special indeed. I'm even going to propose that this unique aspect of human sleep is one of many reasons that justifies our homined name. Because the term homo sapiens is derived from the latin root meaning wise person. And i'll come back to that in just a second, but let's return to sleep. Here is how we are special. Compared to old and new world monkeys as well as apes such as chimpanzees and gorillas. Human sleep sticks out like a proverbial sore thumb in terms of slumber. Or i should actually say two sore thumbs. As first, we are unique in the sense that the total amount of time that we spend asleep is significantly shorter than all other primates. We will typically average around eight hours relative to somewhere between ten to 15 ous of sleep that we've measured in all other primates. The second thing, however, is that, in striking contrast, we humans have a staggering and disproportionate amount of rem sleep, of dream sleep. Because if you look all other primates, if you average them together, will come in at around about nine % of the sleep time dedicated to rem sleep. But in humans, that number is somewhere between 20 to 25 % of all our sleep time being dedicated to rem sleep, dreaming.</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
Sleeping in trees was an evolutionary wise idea up to a point. It provided a safe haven from largeg ond hunting preditors such as hyaenas. But if you become too relaxed in your sleep depth, it may be all the invitation that gravity needs to bring the rest of you hurtling back down into earth. This concern is especially true for the stage of rem sleep - which paralyzes your body and leaves you utterly limp. And it was this danger, the danger of sleeping high up in the trees, that put a limit,. that put a constraint on the amount of time that our primate, forbears, could gravitationally stay in this dangerous state of

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And you'd have to do that each and every night. Oh, my goodness. To me, that sounds like utter torture. That's the equivalent of furniture assembly pur tory in my mind. But let me come back to the explanation. Sleeping in trees was an evolutionary wise idea up to a point. Because sleeping in trees provided a safe haven from largeg ond hunting preditors such as hyaenas, as well as small, blood sucking anthropods, including lice and fleas and ticks. But here's the problem, if you're sleeping 20 to 50 feet up in the air, let's just that you have to be a tad curfl if you become too relaxed in your sleep depth, and, let's say, an arm or a leg will slide down or drop down, it may be all the invitation that gravity needs to bring the rest of you hurtling back down to earth in a life ending fall, and therefore popping you out of the jean pool rather quickly. This concern, this problem, is especially true for the stage of rem sleep. Because, as you will remember from our past podcast episodes, when you go into rem sleep, your brain paralyzes your body, leaving you utterly limp, a literal bag of bones. And it was this danger, the danger of sleeping high up in the trees, that put a limit, that put a constraint on the amount of time that our primate, forbears, could gravitationally stay in this dangerous state of rem sleet paralysis.</blockquote>

<blockquote>My guest is Ido Portal, the world‚Äôs foremost expert on human movement. Ido has spent a lifetime studying, combining and evolving elements from an enormous range of martial arts, dance genres, athletic endeavors, and science, to develop a unified theory and practice of movement called ‚ÄúThe Ido Portal Method.‚Äù Here we discuss all things movement, including the role of the nervous system, reflexive versus deliberate movement patterns, and the link between emotions and awareness in movement. We also discuss learning and neuroplasticity, the mind-body connection and how movement itself can be leveraged toward expanding other types of skillscognitive, creative and otherwise.

And i one point brought a stick into, you know, big conventions. And or i sometimes i use a shirt with holes in it. That's just like i used shirt as a point to make when i'm addressing a crowd, to keep thingswr where it's important, and it's important, we are important, and our experience is important. And we have to be very careful these, these habits and these directions. They come from, many times, good intention, but they are the devil. Many times they turn into the devil, just like our technology nowadays. And what is happening with people with depression, with meaning, meaninglessness, also with the body in various perspectives. Or even, i will also flip it into high performance sports and the ther price. Because for me, this is not a movement practice. It erases the person in the centre of it.

The more i learn from the more i'm thinking that that statement really should be extended to all of life. And i love to remind people, because i start off as a developmental norbiologist, that development doesn't start and end. You don't have childhood and adulthood.

Sophisticated brains tend to create clusters of sophisticated capabilities. The ability to have multiple words for the same concept, or to have elaborate articulation of speech may have been a driving force behind language's evolution.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And where you have song and dance, you always find that those species can generate elaborate language. Now, the simple version of this is howk sophisticated brains tend to create clusters of sophisticated capabilities. But the other possibility, and it's the one that jarvis proposes, and i think it's in line with what you're perhaps raising here, is the idea that movement of the body and range and sophistication of movement of the body through all these different systems, may have actually promoted, or even driven, the evolution of the things that we think of as, you know, speech and language, and the ability to have multiple words for the same concept, or to have elaborate articulation of speech. I find this incredibly attractive as an idea.</blockquote>

Theres es a wonderful study that comes to my frum an israeli laboratory, goim nom sobo s over there, a who has shown that, by recording people's first interactions, that when people meet, if they shake hands, they almost always, i think it's greater than 85 % of the time, they will then wipe the chemicals from the other person onto their own, typically their eyes or their facethis changed a little bit during the whole pendemic thing, but this is thought to be a carry over from what other animals do in terms of exchanging microbiom elements, exchanging chemicals. Ant were constantly feeding or subconscious with the a chemical knowledge of the chemical constituents of other people, right? So it goes way beyond how people smell, how they look, et cetera. More touch seems to me, just as you said, provided it's consensual, seems like just a really good thing over all.</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
It's a hundred and forty years since marks died. His ideas have become major types of thinking in every country on the earth. The marxian ideas eracted with very different cultural histories, religious histories and economic conditions. And therefore, marxism, as a kind of first flush definition, is the totality of all these very different ways of coming to terms with it.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Well,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>the simplest way to begin a definition would be to say it's the tradition that takes its founding inspiration from the works of karl marx a. But because these ideas that he put forward spread as fast as they did and as globally as they did, literally, it's a hundred and forty years since marks died. And in that time, his ideas have become major types of thinking in every country on the earth. Ah, if you know much about the great ideas of human tory, ah, that's an extraordinary spread in an extraordinarily short period of historical time. And what that has meant, that speed of spread and that geographic diversity, is that the marxian ideas eracted with very different cultural histories, religious histories and economic conditions. So the end result was that the ideas were interpreted differently in different places at different times. And therefore, marxism, as a kind of first flush definition, is the totality of all these very different ways of coming to terms with it. For the first roughly forty, 50 years, marxism was te tradition of thinking critically about capitalism. Marks himself, that's all he really did. He never wrote a book about communism. He never wrote a book really about socialism either. His comments were occasional, fragmentary, dispersed. What he was really interested in was a critical analysis of capitalism. And that's what marxism was more or less in its first forty or 50 years.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>A</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 5</b><br/><br/>the only qualification</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>of what i just said was something that happened in paris for a few weeks in 18 71, there was a collapse of the french government consequent upon losing a war to bismarck's germany.</blockquote>

### [15:53] Marxism is a Critique of Capitalism and We Can Do Better

#### ‚ú® Summary
Much of marxism remains chiefly the critique of capitalism, but another part of it becomes a set. They differ from one to the other, a set of notions of what an alternative, post capitalist society ought to look like. And there's lots of disagreement about it, lots of confusion. That would be the framework in which i would answer. Its basic idea, if you had to have one, is that human society can do better than capitalism and it ought to try. Then we can start to talk about what we mean by capitalism.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yes, the com e story. Anyway, the importance in terms of marxism is that now, this seizure of power by a group of marxists, that is, a group of people inspired by marks, developing what you might call a russian even though there were differences among the sians too, but a russian interpretation. This now has to be transformed from a critique of capitalism into a plan, at least, what are you going to do in the soviet union? And a lot of this was then trial and error. Mark never laid any of this out. Probably wouldn't have been all that relevant if he had, cause it was 50 years earlier, in another country, et cetera.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 6</b><br/><br/>So what</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>begins to happen, and you can see how this happens then, more later, in china and cuba and tetnam and korea and so on, is that you have kind of a bifercation. Much of marxism remains, chiefly the critique of capitalism, but another part of it becomes</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 5</b><br/><br/>a</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>set, and they differ from one to the other, a set of notions of</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>what an alternative, post</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>capitalist society ought</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 5</b><br/><br/>to look like, how it ought to work.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And there's lots of disagreement about it, lots</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>of confusion.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Ah, and i would say that that's still where it is. You have a tradition now that has these two major wings, critique capitalism, notion of the alternative, and then a variety of each of those. And that would be the framework in which i would answer. That's what marxism is about. Its basic idea, if you had to have one,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>is that human society</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 7</b><br/><br/>can do better than capitalism, and it ought to try. And</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>then we can start to talk about what we mean by capitalism. Fine, so we'll look at the critique of capitalism on one side, but maybe stepping back, what do you think marks would say</blockquote>

But they don't know. It's not that they're stupid, and it's not that they're ignorant.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 6</b><br/><br/>It's that, well,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>i ignorance maybe, but is not a mental problem, t it's the taboo shut it down. And so all of the reopening that in a way, recaptures what went before and develops it in new directions, they just don't know.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's a serious attempt at making the implicit ideas explicit. The the russians, the the soviets, at the beginning of the twentieth century, made a serious attempt at saying, ok, beyond the critique of capitalism, how do we actually build a system o ries and so in that sense, not at high level, but at a detail level. It's interesting to look at those particular schools. May be right.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Because, for example, just to take your point one step further, you really cannot understand the cuban revolution, the chinese revolution via namiz and the others, because each of them is a kind of response, let's call it, to the way the soviets did it. Are you going to do it that way? Well, yes and no, is the answer.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>This we will do that way, but</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>that we're not going to do.</blockquote>

Imean not iis not that he makes it alone, but things have evolved in russia so that they do the following, they declare that they are socialism. In other words, socialism becomes when you capture the state, not when the state capture has enabled you to do x, y, z other things. No,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>no,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>the state itself,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>once you have it,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>is socialism.

#### ‚ú® Summary
Exploitation exists if and when the surplus that's produced is taken and distributed by people other than those who duced. Slaves produce a surplus which the master gets. Serfs produce a surplusWhich the lord gets. Employees produce a surpluswhich the employer gets. It's very simple. These are exploitive class structures because one class produces a surplus, appropriated, distributed by another group of people not the ones who produced it.

Yes, context</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>easy becomes very easy.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Exploitation exists if and when the</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>surplus that's produced is taken and distributed by people other than those who duced. Slaves produce a surplus which the master gets. Serfs produce a surplus which the lord gets. Employees produce a surplus which the employer gets. It's very simple.

I use a metaphor, simple metaphorical story. You have two children, let's assume,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>and you take em to central park a few blocks from here. It's a nice day, and</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>the children are playing, and in comes one of those men witha ice am truck.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Comes by, dinglingalingling. Your children see the ice cream, daddy, get me an ice cream. So</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>you walk over, you take some money, and you get two ice cream cones, and you give em to one of the children. The other one begins to scream and yell and howl. Obviously, what's the issue. And you realize you've just made a terrible mistake. So you order the one you gave the two ice cream cones, to give one of those to your sister or your brother, or whatever it is. And that's how you solve the problem, until a psychologist comes along and says, you</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 5</b><br/><br/>know, you</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>didn't fix it by what you just did. You</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 7</b><br/><br/>should never have done that in the first place.</blockquote>

You should, you should never do this in the first place. A reallocation of resources creates bitterness and hapules. Look at arth w this country is tearing itself apart now in a way that i have never seen in my life, and i've lived here all my life and i've worked here all my life. It's tearing itself apart.

The point was not who the ter is, but the exploitation per se. You've got to change the organization of the workplace so there isn't</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>a group that makes all the decisions and gets the surplus ves visivi, another one that produces it. If</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>you do that, you will destroy the whole project.

markets are about how to handle shortage. And so if the demand is greater than the supply, ok, now you've got a problem. You can't satisfy all the demanders cause you dont hav enough supply. Now, how are you going to do it in a market? You allow people who have a lot of money to bid up the price of whatever short that solves your problem. As the price goes up, the poor people can't, they drop out. It goes to the people with the most money. Most human beings, confronted with this explanation of a market would turn against it, cause it contradicts their n judaic, islamic, all of em would say,

They write up a project, they send the project in to some government office where it is looked at gainst other projects. And this office in the government decides whe could have fund this one and that one, because they're more needed in our society. We are in greater need of solving this problem than that problem. And so we're going to lend money to people working on this problem more readily, or more money than we lend over here, because we're going to. But</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>instead, what we do is, who can pay the highest interestry? Wo whal. You do it. Why? Why? What ethics would justify you do it? It's like a market in general. Something is in shortage.

You allow people who have a lot of money to</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>bid up the price of whatever short that solves your problem, because as the price goes up, the poor people can't, they drop out. They can't buy the thing at the exalted price. So you've got a way of distributing the shortage. It</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>goes to the people with the most money. At this point, most human beings, confronted with this explanation of a market would turn against it, cause</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>it contradicts their n judaic,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>islamic, all of em would say, what you know that means?

### [25:07] The Sacrificial Aspect of Attention

#### ‚ú® Summary
Worship is it has this salebratory aspect, and that is tied in to this instinct to imitate. And so partly, what's happening in a church ceremony, for example, is that an object of lbratory worship is specified. In the christian tradition, that's christ - which is a very strange thing, because he meat a absolutely abysmal end. But you realize that in order to exist in the world, you are constantly having to sacrifice,. That you have to sacrifice the idiosyncrasies in order to be able to grasp the the object.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>celebration. Cause you might say, well, you know, what does it mean to worship? And a cynical person would say, it means to believe things that one but a damnd fool would believe, you know. And that's kind of a dismissive modern attitude. But that isn't what it means. Like worship is it has this salebratory aspect, and that is tied in to this instinct to imitate. So if you have a sports hero, first of all, he's a hero, and he is someone you put on a pede, which indicates a kind of an elevation towards the divine, or towards the sky, metaphorically speaking. And then there is this compulsion to imitate. And that's no different than celebration. And so partly, what's happening in a church ceremony, for example, is that an object of lbratory worship is specified. And in the christian tradition, that's christ. And which is a very strange thing, because, of course, he meat a absolutely abysmal end. And that's an unbelievably complicated idea too, that that</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>the</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>the tragic, the ultimately tragic, element of human life is to be voluntarily apprehended in the deepest possible sense. And that what that produces, paradoxically, is a celebration and then also a vision of the resurrection. And that's an idea that's so deep you you can lose yourself in that. Well, we've lust ourself in it for two and years. Because one of the things that this attention problem brings about is the question of sacrifice to and</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>you see it in the in religious ceremonies. But you realize that in order to exist in the world, you are constantly having to sacrifice, that you have to sacrifice the idiosyncrasies in order to be able to grasp the the object. Cause this can be all kinds of things, rikei o be a dog's toto, cnd, be cand be a million things. But in order to be able to grasp it, i have to sacrifice h idiosyncrasies. And i also have to somehow, let say, recognize it in its highest form, or kind of move it towards its highest form. And that seems to be an aspect of religious thinking, is acty part of attention, which</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>i et well, thi sacrificial aspect of attention, in part, is that whenever you see something as that thing, you sacrifice the possibility of all the other things it could be. And that's delimiting to a large degree. You know, it hems you in, but, but that's also lief, because, you know, how many bloody million things do you want to attend to at one time? But so part of the reason, you know, the idea of sacrifice, the conscious idea of sacrifice, emerges very easy early on.</blockquote>

The structure of sacred architecture, say, duplicates the structure of cognitive category and also the structure of perceptual category. So we inhabit a temple, corrupt though it may be, with every interaction with the world that we undertake. It's like te it's the precondition for the idea of reality itself, which i that's really real, right? I mean, you've got real that's nothing. That is not a scientific presupposition. The christian idea of the logos, and the greek idea as well, is the expression of the recognition of the preconditions for the real itself. And that's really something to understand as well.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And so it's strange that the structure of sacred architecture, say, duplicates the structure of cognitive category and also the structure of perceptual category. So we inhabit a temple, corrupt though it may be, with every interaction with the world that we undertake. And that's really quite a frightening thing to lize, very it's a very frightening thing to realize. When you really realize it, it's like, oh, ohoh, this is real. And it's even worse than that. It's like te it's the precondition for the idea of reality itself, which i that's really real, right? I mean, you've got real that's nothing. It's the precondition for reality itself that's superreal. And, you know, to some degree, the christian idea of the logos, and the greek idea as well, is the expression of the recognition of the precondition for the real itself. And that's really something to understand as well. You know, scientists, i talked to richard dawkins when i was at oxford, you know, and one of the things that characterizes dawkins is that dawkins believes that the truth will set you free. That is not a scientific presupposition. That is a religious presupposition, but it also might be the religious presupposition without which science is not possible. Because all the scientists i know whoare real scientists, they're unthey abide by the truth to an unbelievable degree. You know, if you're a social scientist and you have a data set in front of you, you know, say, 200 columns of 500 rows, you know, a complex data set, an there are a lot of ways you can get that to talk to you statistically. And you make thousands of decisions when you're doing a statistical analysis. And every single one of those is an ethical decision. And one of the decisions is, whell do i priotize my career, or do i priortize my pursuit of the truth? And often those are antagonistic, because if you have a big daticet, you want to discover something in it, and maybe there's nothing there, and then you've wasted two years, and that's pretty hard on your career.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But people think, well, that's what that's how you look at the world if you're sensible. It's like while franz de wall's been studying chimps for 30 years, and that's not true. That is not what happens. He told me flat out that frequently, small male can become alpha, especially if he has the support of a influential female. And the small male becomes elphop and has the support of the influential female, not because he expresses arbitrary power, but because he's unbelievably good at mutual reciprocation. And so he has friends, and he does things for his friends, and they do things for him, and they trust each other. And he has lots of friends, which also means he has no enemies, which turns out to be really important. Because the brute chimps, like the cyclopath elphus, they do rule now and then, but they get torn to shreds by their enemies, because, you know, they're tough, let's say, and mean, but they have day and two chimps they stamped a week before, ally together and tear them, literally tear them into shreds. And so the the psychopath chimp types who use power to attain dominance, have very short rules and end in a very bloody way. And de wall has pointed out, like pge did among children, that power is an unstable a ethic upon which to base the social hierarchy, even for chimps. And chimps are male dominated, they have a patriarchal society, and they're relatively brutal, and it doesn't even work for them. It certainly doesn't work for human beings. So whatever is at the apex of the pyramid, it's not, as the bloody marxists insist, you know, the raw expression of powerand and exploitation. Wrong, wrong. Not the case. Doesn't even work in nature. Doesn't work for rats, doesn't work for panzes, certainly doesn't work for people. And then there is a kind of natural ethic that emerges out of that,</blockquote>

Even among animals, mutual reciprocity seems to be a cardinal organizing feature. We all are struck with the problem of determining what we are going to put in the highest place.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>It certainly doesn't work for human beings. So whatever is at the apex of the pyramid, it's not, as the bloody marxists insist, you know, the raw expression of powerand and exploitation. Wrong, wrong. Not the case. Doesn't even work in nature. Doesn't work for rats, doesn't work for panzes, certainly doesn't work for people. And then there is a kind of natural ethic that emerges out of that, right? Because with rats and with chimps and other social animals, it varies to some degree from species to species, thereis the necessity for something like mutual reciprocity as the basis for successful social organization. And that some thin like, treat your neighbor like you would want to be treated. It's something like that. It's the behavior equivalent of that. Now, ass earlier, you know, from whence does the highest injunction emerge or e when comes d yet yt. Well, it's strange, right? Some of it's bought em up. It's like, even among animals, mutual reciprocity seems to be a cardinal organizing feature, even done in the spirit of play, interestingly enough, ecause play is a mammalian universal. And that's kind of bot em up. But then at the same time, this, this, i suppose, pertains to the role, of the mysterious role of consciousness in the world. It's like, while we're also aware of this, right? And we also, we also think about it abstractly as a good and we don't only learn it bottom up, we also conceptiualize it top down. And then they meet. And that is, that's moses coming down the mountain with the tablets. And so what did he meet on the mountain? Well, god, whell. He met whatever's at the highest place. And we all are struck with the problem of determining what we are going to put in the highest place. And increasingly, i have been viewing the biblical corpuse as an attempt to cast narrative light on the nat of the spirit that should be at the highest place. So i can giveyou an example of that. So in the earliest stages of genesis, god is so what should be in the highest place?</blockquote>

I really mean that technically. So if if imagine that, that your ethic was that you were a hundred % compassionate, ok. So what are you like? Well, you're like a good mother with a child under six months of age. Because human babies are born premature in some fundamental sense. And there's complex reasons for that.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>ya. Andwe, if</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>you look at it historically, you can see that at the first moment when the, letsa, the religious ideal starts to crack, you get some positive things like, you know, science and t enlightenment. But maki desad is right there, waiting to manifest the spirit that dostoyevsky finds in raskolnikov. It's there im in terms of sam, one of the things that i haven't heard you talk about too much, but there's something about what you said with him that that brings it up to me, is that he sees this hierarchy, or this the sa religious structure, has a totalitarian impulse, and it is a kind of structure that comes down and manifests itself. One of the things that comes down from the mountain, let's say, in religious stories, is also compassion. Without the hierarchy, there is, is it possible for there to be compassion? Because compassion is also the manner in which we accept that nothing ever reaches the ideal, that we can recognize it, but we also know that it's always kind of beyond us. And so there is a sense that is judging us. But there is also a sense in which it kind of yields because, you know, everyg is imperfect, and everything, every, every house is imperfect, every building, everything that we notice, we can also see that it doesn't reach that ideal. I don't if you ever thought about that a little bit. Well, let me think about that for se eve. Never talked about compassion before. So,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>yes. Well, when i, when i think about compassion, i mean, first of all, i do not believe that compassion is an untrammelled moral virtue. And i think one of the terrible things about our society, one of the deadly, eatable things about our society, is that we've put compassion in the highest place, unthinkingly. And compassion is for infants. I really mean that technically. So if if imagine that, that your ethic was that you were a hundred % compassionate, ok. So what are you like? Well, you're like a good mother with a child under six months of age. Because, because human babies are born premature in some fundamental sense. So, you know, the average gestation period for a mammal of about our size should be two years. And so our babies are born radically premature. And there's complex reasons for that. One is that there's a arms race, and evolutionary arms race, between the circumference of the infant's head and the dimensions of the pelvic hole through which the baby has to pass to be born.</blockquote>

We are at a point where objective reality itself, or mathematics themselves, are being questioned. How do we come back to that without thet say, bringing about this notion of this incarnational principle? We could say right that even things that we encounter in the world, they are embodiments embedded in higher truth.

The world's just too complex for us to generate our values in the span of a single life, out of whole cloth, autonomously. And partly the reason that's impossible is, well, ok, so generate your own values. But then what are you going to do with your wife or your husband or your friend? They're what are they going to they're justn live by your values all of a sudden? Well, it's an instinct. Play integrates base motivations into a higher unity, but it'san instinct.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>these values that and temptations and impulses come upon us that we cannot control, they are part of our autonomous nature. And because they have this autonomy, and so that would be the autonomy of emotions and the autonomy of motivations, and then even the autonomy of the spirit that unites motivations, because we don't know for ex in the spirit of play, for example. Play is an instinct. Play integrates base motivations into a higher unity, but it's an instinct. And so young realized very rapidly that it wasn't technically possible for us to create orn values. And that's partly his stumb upon the problem of complexity. S the world's just too complex for us to generate our values in the span of a single life, out of whole cloth, autonomously, no matter how much of a superman we were, ye.

And so i believe. And yung kind of convinced me of that. He he more or less posited. And you could say the same thing about orthodox. He said, catholic is as sane as people ever get. And that's partly because we have to have one foot in the dream and the mystery. We have to, you knowh douglas murray speak recently about this. That was very interesting, as murray is an atheist, essentially, and he has a variety of reasons for that. But he has swung around hard recently. And he said, when he was talking to dave reuben, he said, i don't believe that either conservatism or classic liberalism can sur in the absence of of the religious surround which was really something for him to admit. And it'slike takin him like five years of thinking to come to that conclusion. But then he said something even more remarkable, i thought. And he said, and it's actually the mysterious part of it that has to be retained, the virgin birth, the resurrection, the crucifix and all of that crazy mythology, let's say, because otherwise it just degenerates into another form of cheap social justice. And like, don't we have enough of that? And i think that's now, i don't know what to make of that because, well, and that's why we have discussion continually about the, what would you say, while the transcendent, i suppose, the miraculous, the transcendent, the idea of the resurrection, for example, and all of that, it's like, well, what do you do with that? And the answer is, we don't know, but we don't throw it out without o have isome sense of what's going to come in to replace it. And we're seeing that now, you know, look at us. We're so confused. No, bloody in't wonder the russians are at war with us. Is like we're not havinganything to do those people.

Are those people insane? Like, clearly, clearly, that's just way too far, right? Dick? When i talk to my democrat friends, i say, look, you can have one of those. No, there's either no distinction between man anr a woman, or it's important that a woman's on the supreme court. But there is no bloody way i'm giving you both.

Zero. There was no am we didn't do any post talk editing, and he didn't ask for any. He answered all the questions i asked him with no prevarication. You know, there was a few kind of prepared political talking points and, ah, but i thought he handled himself extremely well. He a very good conversationalist. He could really take turns in a conversation. He was thoughtful. I believe that his care for working class people is genuine. I think his economic policy is unsophisticated to the point of, ah, would you say, danger insufficiency? And i've talked tof some very sophisticated economic players in the canadian market. And they believe that our basic legal framework and our economic framework is forty years out of date. And these are people who've played, let's say, on the international market and got burned badly by hiper qualified american legal experts who just tore them into shreds when they tried to compete on broadscale and international markets. We don't have good policies for data ownership in canada. We're way out of sink with the digital age.

It‚Äôs called Kyzen - and I am proud to announce that I will be bringing it to the world later this year to challenge you to empower yourself and accomplish greater things in life. To learn more, join my Discord at http://impacttheory.com/discord Big goals require DISCIPLINE. By it's very nature, discipline requires you to do hard things - and that is a skill you can LEARN. I'm teaching my process to build Ironclad Discipline in a new workshop - you can register at discipline.impacttheory.com! On Today's Episode: Why is being rich something so many people want, but so few achieve. Does being successful guarantee becoming rich? Obviously that requires you to define what success is for you and your journey. The funny twist in all of this is that being rich is so easily fantasized and yet the work it takes to become rich and successful is barely thought of. Jim Rohn said, ‚ÄúSuccessful people do what unsuccessful people are not willing to do.‚Äù As hard as that is to accept as truth, it is evident when you look at elite athletes, world-class performers, and the best of the best in any field. When you watch this, understand that Tom‚Äôs drive is always fulfillment, meaning, and purpose. The work it takes to achieve his level of success is not easy nor is it for the faint of heart. It‚Äôs not impossible, and it‚Äôs not the only path forward, but it has proven to be majorly successful over and over again. The path to becoming rich and successful is going to require you to dig deep and it requires skills, grit, and determination for you to tap into a level of potential you never knew was possible.

But the only way to make it a reality is to put in the work. You've got to put in the work. The change is hard. The change is difficult. The change will demand everything of you. But man, if inside you really believe in what you're doing, you really see how you can get to that goal that you want, if you really see how you can serve other people doing you do with this skill set that you've worked your ass off to acquire, then you can actually make change in people's lives. And that's what motivates me. Getting the skills has real world implications. It took me from scrounging in my couch cushions to find enough change to put gas in my car to building a billion dollar business. It is absolutely limitless what you can accomplish. Now think about that. If that's really true, if what i just said is true, that human potential is limitless, then how you spend your time becomes a spiritual consideration. You're the average of the five peope you spend the most time with. That's just true. And but now it's become so common to say, and it's like every instagram post that i fear it's going to lose its meaning. Who are you spending time with? Because if you're spending time with people like you, you're spending time with people like me, i'm raising you up, or i'm just not going to spend time with you. So it's like, now, if you get in a mix of people like that, who are like men, we'd love for you to raise up to this level. But if you don't, it's fine, but we're just not goin tospend time with you. All of a sudden that desire to belong to something powerful that you can see is going to lead you to your dreams. And i remember saying to my wife over and over and over, they are the surest path to my success. I don't know anything else. I just know if i can hang on to these guys, they're going to make me better. And so that was through all the years of being embarrassed and developing, actually, massive anxiety, because i was always behind. I was always the dumbest person on the phone. I was always the dumbest person in the room. And it was like, was i going to be willing to emotionally go through that to get great? And most people can't. So here's a thing. Now, imagine i'm not the only person they said, hey, this is the start of m you know, any job you want. They i saw 12 people, maybe more, come and go over the years. B u. They just couldn't emotionally deal with it. And so i remember thinking to myself, why is it that i'm able to do this? And the answer was, i could self soothed faster than anyone else. So i would get kicked in the face and i would do something really dumb. I'd be called an idiot, told how stupid i was, and then i'd just be like, r i need to re center. And that just became my obsession. I need to be able to emotionally get back to complete neutral so fast that you don't even see it register on my face. How' you do it? How do you do literally practising. So remember, the same time, i'm reading about the brain voraciously. I'm reading about people that understand human behavior. I'm getting into cognitive science, noral science, like really going into it. So i'm reading all the stuff going wo we're just a chemical processing plant. There are physiological hooks into these chemicals. So hey, if you're ad, scared, whatever, but you force yourself to laugh out loud, you will change your neuro chemical state. And you literally, your experience is the neuro chemistry. So i like woe. So i could get i could be in a situation where 'm being beraded, or i legitimately mess up and it costs money, and it's like, woe. That's on me. And it is. Nobody's bad but my on. And i realize that what most people do, their strategy is to deflect. It is your fault, not my fault. Yes? So i started thinking of this as a metaphor. People are throwing gold at me. They're throwing it really hard, and i can put a shield up and deflect it, but then i lose that piece of gold. If i drop my shield and just take the pain, let it hit me in t head, then i bend down ad go this thing, which was me being</blockquote>

When you have the skills, no one and nothing can stop you. Becoming so good they can't stop you. That's the greatest joy you're ever going to experience in life - being truly and uniquely yourself. Through a cruel twist of fate, the only way for man to really develop themselves is through suffering.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>What do you want badly enough to suffer for what price are you willing to to become the person that you want to become? When you do that, when you have the skills, no one and nothing can stop you. Really think about that for a second. There is a level of lity, a level of steel set where you can get so good at something, no matter how much people hate you, no matter how much they want to bring you down. No matter how actively they come for you, you can stand before them and say, i will not fall because you can out perform. It's not about convincing, it's not about politicing. It's about getting betterand when you understand that that is what the human animal is capable of, when you understand thut that's what you're capable of, everything in your life changes. It just becomes a simple choice. What do you want that bady? Tha? You're going to turn that one into etha. You're going to do the work t you're going to show nice weakens your going to put into work.

i know that i s brutally difficult to hear. If we're dealing with insecurities, then that may be the only solution. No matter how good you think you are, you're still being ignored. And if you find yourself doing that, i will say, hit the brakes right? You've got to get to the point where it would just be absurd to anybody looking at that situation to think that you weren't killing it.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>them. And if you find yourself doing that, i will say, hit the brakes right? Because first and foremost, you always want to look at what you could be doing. So there's two things you could be doing up in your game. No matter how good you think you are, you're still being ignored. And so if we talk about getting so good that they can't ignore you, then we know that we haven't achieved that yet. And then the second thing you can do is move on. And well, i know that i s brutally difficult to hear. If we're dealing with insecurities, then that may be the only solution. So first, i want to focus the most of our attention on this idea that you really can get so good that you can't be ignored. And i think a great example of this is garry van chuck. Now, if you guys don't know his story, it's such a cool story of somebody who came up working for their father. Their dad, i'm sure, in many ways, thought of them the same way that, you know, he was just the kid. And it got to the point where garry saw an opportunity for him to do something in a completely different part of the business, where he could establish himself. So now it was about an area that his father didn't understand, his father didn't have expertese, and garry could show with results, point blank, that he was able to do something that his father wasn't. He took ther a liquor store business from something like six million dollars in revenue to, i think, almost 70 million dollars in revenue. I mes, extraordinary in a relatively short period of time, just a few years, if i'm not mistaken. So that's the kind of thing there's no way, no matter how insecure the other person is, no matter how they may have their own a problems, emotionally soothing, or staying centred, or getting their ego out of the way, whatever the things are that they're dealing with, there's no way to look at those numbers and not say, a ight, clearly, what he was doing is working. And to me, that is where you have to get. You've got to get to the point wherei it would just be absurd to anybody looking at that situation to think that you weren't killing it.</blockquote>

You're never going to get people's respect until you're actually good. Phil jackson said that until he helped michael become a leader, they didn't win championships because michael was so antagonistic. And if you read 11 rings by phil jackson, he talks about that transition that jordan went through. That me, is extraordinarily telling of greatness, that you get yourself good, extraordinary, to the point where people can rely on you. You're really pursuing greatness.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But you should be able to have, maybe even more kindness for the person struggling to do that. The person that is may be paralyzed or overwhelmed, that even as you're going that hard cores, that people can see that you actually care about humans, that it isn't just who's got something that they can do for me, who's going to be able to lift me up and help my project, but you're looking for ways to help other people. You're going out of your way to be kind to people. That's if its worth its weight in gold. But you're never going to get people's respect until you're actually good. So now imagine being the best on the team and being kind to the worst player that's pried out the right way about amenites two ideas out. I think you do need to hold the worst player accountable, but john wooden, one of the greatest basketball coaches of all time, said that he would judge people when he was scouting a high school player. That there were times where he would intentionally have like a the tor or the water boy or something, spill water around a player he was recruiting, cause he wanted to see how they would react. And if they were a jerk to that person, he wouldn't bring them on the team. Because he knew it's not just about finding the best players. It's about finding people that can work together, finding ways to create harmony. Le's about michael jordan. Phil jackson said that until he helped michael become a leader, they didn't win championships because michael was so antagonistic. And looked michael was hard on people his whole career. Dong me wrong. But he said he had to help michael understand that he had to play as a team, that this couldn't be just about jordan. And now, if you look at the things that jordan talks about, he always credits the team, the team, the team. I was a part of a winning team. And he'll rattle off the players by name. And if you read 11 rings by phil jackson, he talks about that transition that jordan went through. And that me, is extraordinarily telling of greatness, that you get yourself good, extraordinary, to the point where people can rely on you. You're you're really pursuing greatness.</blockquote>

Some very eager that this country, america, goes through that entirely self destructive exercise. I i say that there's a, there's a lot of promise of this. But if i could refine it out of one thing, i'd say this, a, it's no longer about a wealth transfer from one group of people who did something wrong to another group of people who were wronged. It would have been, it would have been, that could have been that 200 years ago. To day, it's not even the descendants of people who did something wrong giving money to people who were the descendants of people who were wronged. It's a wealth transfer from people who look like people who did a wrong thing in the past to another group of people who resemble people who were wronged. That's impossible to do. Im completely clear about this. There is no way in which you could organize such a a wealth transfer on moral or practical reasons. America is filled with people who are em have the same skin colour as us, for instance, who have no connection to the slave trade and should not be made to pay money to people who have some connection.

But is it attributable to slavery at's a stretch a if you're in a city like chicago, where the homicide rates shot up in the last two years, all beit, again, as as always, has to be remembered mainly black, ond black gun violence and knife violence. Nevertheless, if youre in a city like chicago and you make that calculus i've just suggested, the cleched one a the street late at night, there are other factors other than a memory of slavery, the kiken.

Why during the chronoviris era, when we know that obesity is the one clearest factor that's likely to lead to your iation if you also get the virus, why did almost no public health information n america focus on obesity? 80 % of the people who ended up hospitalizes in america with coronovirus were abese. We locked the schools when there was no evidence that the coronovirus was deadly for children. We all wore cloth masks when there was very little evidence that this was much use in stopping the spread of the virus. We had massive evidence about obecity being a problem, and we never addressed it. Why is it just because we worried about fat people? No, it's actually because about fat shaming, as it were. It's also because, to a great extent, it's a ratial issue in america as well. And asha quoteed this new publication from the university, university of chicago, as it happens, which makes that claim explicit. Says, the reasons why people a e have views that are negative about a b city is because of racism and slavery. This is what everything is drawn back america. Anything you want to stop, you say it's because of races, amd, it's because of slavery. How about it's actually because, you mind, the hospital is getting clogged up. You mind people dying. You mind, i think minority is disproportionately dying, and you'd like to say something about it. Once again, as in everything in america, it's cut off by some poorly educated academic saying, it's tout slavery. So we're really not this requires a kind of form of brain surgery to perform it on a society, and probably one it's not possible without killing the patient.

Strong words, but can you try to steal me on the case? Not in this particular situation, but there's people that have lived through something, they can comment in a very specific way, like, for example, holcott's survivors. Yes, there is a sense in which may be a basic sense of civility when a holicost survivor is speaking about their experience of the holocost than a an intellectual from a very different part of the world is simply writing about a neon deo, politics. He world war too. Just should not interrupt the holcot survivor. We</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>might physically interrupt them if they telling us an dortis with</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>logic and reason, that the experience of the holicot survivor is somehow fundamentally has a deeper understanding of the humanity</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>and the injustice. First of all, i again, when even deeper warters now. But in terms of wanting to listen to another person who has experienced something, yes, yes. But not endlessly, not endlessly. I mean, there are some people who've written about the, i the are people whove writen about the holocaust who didn't experience the holocaust, and have written about it better than people who did. It's not this, this, this idea that the lived experience, to use this terrible modern jargon, as if there's another type. This this this idea that the lived experience has to try umph over everything else, is not always correct. It can be correct in some circumstances. If you were sitting in a room with a hollocost survivor and somebody who'd never heard about the holicoust and wanted a kind of, you know, shoot out their views on it, yes, one of those people should be heard more than the other, obviously, sly, if there's somebody who's experienced raceisn first hand, and there's somebody else who has never experienced it, then obviously you'd want to hear from the person who has experienced it first hand. If that is the discussion under way. I don't think that it's the case, that that is endlessly the case. I'm also highly reluctant to concede that there are groups of people who, by dint of their skin collar or anything else, get to dominate the microphone. Of course, we're literally both speaking to microphones at the moment, so there's an irony to this. But let's skate over th what i mean is people saying, you don't have the right to speak. I have the right to take myke friend from you and speak because i know best. Fine, if you know best, we'll argue it out, and some one will win, long or short term. But the the er, the almost aggressive tone in which this is now levelled, i don't like the sound of nobody's experience is completely understandable by another human being. Nobody's. And what many people are asking us to do at the moment, us collect tively, is to fall for that thing. I think it was camille faster who said, at first, but i've adopted in recent years, is to say, you must spend an inordinate amount of your life trying to understand me personally, my lived experience, everything about me, you should dedicate your life to into. Do that. Simultaneously, you'll never understand me. This is not an attractive invitation. Thisi this is an unwinnable game.</blockquote>

And one of the ways i've sort of sort of found myself explainied i osay, it's also important to recognize that resentment is something that can cross absolutely every boundary. So for instance, it crosses all racial boundaries. Obviously, i go without saying more interesting as it crosses all class boundaries and socio economic boundaries. And if i wase to sort of simplify this thought, i would say, i guess that you and i and everybody watching knows, or has known somebody in their lives who has almost nothing in worldly terms, and is a generous person, a kindly person, a giving person, a a happy person, even a cheerful person. And i think wed probably have also, or many of us will have met people who seem to have everything, and who ware filled with resentment, filled with resentment somebody else has held them back from something. Their sister once did something tta she shouldn't. She got this, and i should have got that, and and on and on and on. It's a human trait. And what one of the things that suggests to me is that we therefore have a choice in our lives about this. This is something which we can do something abouti not limitlessly, but for instance, i mean, there are very good reasons thas some people in their lives might feel resentment. Let's say you're involved in a car crash and a friend fell asleep at the wheel, and that's why you are spending the rest of your life in a wheel chair. Tat's a pertinent example of this in american politics at the moment. Am, you would be justified in feeling resentment.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Caseis,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>look at this by this stage, ok, how many was madam armlet? Wel how many just messy, big, bloody, eggy piles have the marxists created by now? And country after country, theyare always next time they are going to produce the great omelet. But they never have, and they never will, because the whole thing is rotten from the start. But let me just also say one thing, because, of course, mark isn't as nice as he sounds. Nd, that's one of the things thati try to highlight in the book is, if we're going to do this reductive thing of people in history and saying whell they had views that were of their time, and we must therefore condemn them for them, say, fine, let's do the same thing with marks. And there are things i quote in this book for mark's letters, not least letters to engles. And indeed, in his published writings, in part piece he was writing for the american press in the eight in fifties, the way, he has horrible views on slavery and and and er colonialism and much more. But the main thing is only the horrible things he says about black people and the con use of the nd word. In fact, when i was doing the udea book for the walnwets, i had to decide will i read out the quotes from marks or not. If i had read them out, i'd have been cancelled, because peoplewould have just said, you've been using the end word so much in this passage, and you know this. And i slightly thought doing it, so that i could say i was only quoting marks to try to hit the point home. In the end, of course, i was sensible, and as i did not do but mark's letters are disgusting on these terms. Since i highlighted this in this book, and some of the media have picked it up a and er and have popularized this, i'm trying to put into the system, which is, if you're going to accuse churchill of racism, ou're gon to accuse, accuse jefferson of racism, washington of racism. And someone what about marks? The two things that mariss have said since this came out has been, first of all, why are you saying this about marks? He was a man of his time, like everyone else. And second thing they say is, we don't go to marks for his horrible, abhorrent views on race. They're talking about mixed race people as guerillas and so on. We don't go to him for that. We go to him for his economic theories. I say, ok, well, we don't go to thomas jefferson for his views on slaves. We don't go to churchill for his the precise language he used that points in the 19 tens about indians, or his health advice, or his health advice. Wesh, i do get in for that. But</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>that explains so much. Buthaware</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>some standards on thisand s why i that's why 'm very suspicious of the fact that the people don't do this with marks, because i think what they're trying, what some people are trying to do, and this isn't, this may sound conspiratorial, but i really don't think it is.</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
Darwin knew very early on that none of the ideas that anybody had ever offered gave him a sense of understanding how evolution could have worked. He spent a lot of time working on this idea and coming, you know, reading about things that gave him hints but not knowing why. After he figured it out, he had nightmares about it. And so he didn't publish for a long time, in part because he was scared of his own ideas.

And then then he figured it out. But after he figured it out, he had nightmares about it. He would dream about the complexity of the eye and the arguments that people had given about how ridiculous it was to imagine that that could have ever emerged from some sort of, you know, unguided process, that it hadn't been the product of design and, and so he didn't publish for a long time, in part because he was scared of his own</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
Mathematics is a set of tools for exploring idealized worlds that often turn out to be extremely relevant to the real world. They are worlds in which objects exist with idealized properties, and in which the relationships among them can be characterized with precision so as to allow you to derive other facts with certainty. So, i think of mathematics as a Set of Tools For Exploring Idealized Worlds.

The insight that human mathematicians have had is a combination of the intuitive, kind of connection s like knowledge. It then ultimately becomes a part of the intuition that the next generation of mathematical thinkers have to ground their own thinking on. I came across this quotation from enri poincare while i was walking in the in the woods with my wife in northern californiaa late last summer. And what it said on the bench was, it is by logic that we prove, by intuition that we discover. That sort of represents the potential of capturing this, the intuitive side of this.

So what a what's the what's a good way to model such powerful mathematical reasoning? Would you say, what are some ideas you have for capturing this in a model? The</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>insight that human mathematicians have had is a combination of the kind of, the intuitive, kind of connection s like knowledge that makes it so that something is just like, obviously true, so that you don't have to think about why it's true. That then makes it possible to then take the next step and ponder and reason and figure out something that you previously didn't have that intuition about. It then ultimately becomes a part of the intuition that the next generation of mathematical thinkers have to ground their own thinking on, so that they can extend the ideas even further. I came across this quotation from enri poincare while i was walking in the in the woods with my wife in a state park in northern californiaa late last summer. And what it said on the bench was, it is by logic that we prove, by intuition that we discover. And so what what for me, the essence of the of the project is to understand how to bring the intuitive connectionist resources to bear on letting the intuitive discovery arise, you know, from engagement in thinking with this formal system. So i think of, you know, the ability of somebody like hinton or newton, or einstein, or romelhart, or picera, to a archimedes, another example, writes, suddenly a flash of insight occurs. It's, it's like the constellation of all o these simultaneous constraints that somehow or other causes the mind to settle into a novel state that it never did before, and and give rise to a new idea a that, you know, then you can say, ok, well, now, how can i prove this? You know, how do i write down the steps of that theorem that that allow me to make it rigorous and certain? And so i feel like the the kinds of things that we're beginning to see deep learning systems do of their own accord kind of gives me this feeling of, of, am, i don't know, hope or encouragement that ultimately, um, it'll all happen. Am, so in particular, as a many people now, have have become really interested in thinking about, you know, noral networks that have been trained with massive amounts of text can be given a prompt, and they can then sort of generate some really interesting, fanciful, creative story from that prompt. A and ah, there's, there's kind of like a sense that they've somehow synthesized something like a novel out of the, you know, all f the particulars of all the billions and billions of experiences that went into the training data, that it gives rise to something like this sort of intuitive sense of what would be a, a fun and interesting little story to tell, or something like that. It just sort of wells up out of the, out of the letting the thing play out its own imagining of what somebody might say given this prompt, as as impot to get itto to start to generate its own thoughts and and to me, that that sort of represents the potential of capturing this, the intuitive side of this.</blockquote>

I think that's a very interesting question, and i think it's one of the ones that i'm actually very interested in right now. A, but i i think the answer is, in important ways, it is important draw that line, but then to come back and look at it again and see some of the subtleties and interesting aspects of the difference. A, so if we think about chomsky himself, um, he e was born into an academic family. His father was a professor of rabinical studies at a small rabbinical college in philadelphia. A, and he was deeply inculturated in a, you know, a culture of thought and reason, and brought to the effort to understand natural language this profound engagement with these formal systems. And a, you know, i think that there was tremendous power in that, and that chamsky had some azing insight into the structure of natural language. But that use the word but there, the actual intuitive knowledge of these things only goes so far, and does not go as far as it does in people like thomsky himself. And this was something that was discovered in the phd. Dissertation of lila glightman, who was actually trained in the same linguistic department with chomsky. So what lila discovered was that the intuitions that linguists had about even the meaning of a phrase, not just about its but about what they thought a phrase must mean, were very different from the intuitions of an ordinary person who wasn't a formally trained thinker. And well, it recently has become much more salient. I happened to have learned about this when i myself was a ph d. Student at the university of pennsylvania, but im i never knew how to put it together with all my other thinking about these things. So so i actually currently have the hypothesis that formerly trained linguists and other formally trained a academics, whether it be linguistics, philosophy, cognitive science, computer s, machine learning, mathematics, a have a mot if engagement with experience that is intuitively, deeply structured to be more organized around a the systematicity, a and a ability to be conformant with the principles of a system than a than is actually true of the natural human</blockquote>

The natural numbers were considered to be a part of the innate endowment of, you know, core knowledge. It turns out that many cognitive scientists agreed with him for a time. And it's actually been more or less accepted by almost everyone that the natural numbers are actually a cultural construction. A certain mode of thinking about language itself becomes so second nature that you don't know what it is that you need to teach and in fact, we don't really teach it all that explicitly anyway.

So you've lived an incredible life in terms of the ideas you've put out into the world, in terms of the trajecto you've taken through your career, through your life, what advice would you give to young people to day in high school and college about a how to have a career, or how to have a life they can be proud of? Finding</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>the thing that you are intrinsically motivated to engage with, and then celebrating that discovery is is what, ah, what it's all aboutwewhen when i was in college, i struggled with that, i i am, i had thought i wanted to be a psychiatrist, because i think i was interested in human psychology and high school, and at that time, the only sort of information i had that had anything to do with the psyche was, you know, freud and eric from and sort of popular psychiatry kinds of things. And so, well, they were psyc atrist, right? So i had to be a psychiatrist. Anda that meant i had to go to medical school. And i got to college, and i find myself taking, you know, the first semester of a three quarter physics class, and it was mechanics. And this was so far from what it was i was interested in, but it was also too early in the morning, in the winter quart somester. So i never made it of the physics class. But i wandered about the rest of my freshman year and most of my sophomore year until, a, i found myself in the midst of this situation where around me, m there was this big revolution happening. I was at columbia university in 19 68, and the via um war is going on. Columbia is building a gim in morningside heights, which is part of harlem. And people are thinking, oh, the big bad rich guys are stealing the the the park land that belong to the people of harlem. And a, you know, they're part of the military industrial complex, which is enslaving us and sending us all off to war in vianom. And so there is a big revolution that a confluence of black activism and, you know, s t s and social justice, and the whole university blew up and got shut down. And a, i got a chance to sort of think about why people were behaving the way they were in this context. And i, you know, i happened to have taken mathematical statistics. I happened to have been takin psychology that quarter, ad just sike one and somehow things in that space all ran together in my mind and got me really excited about about asking questions about why people, what made certain people go into the buildings and not others, and things like that. And so suddenly i had a path forward. And i had just been wandering around aimlessly and athe different points my career, you know, when i think, ok, well, should i take this class? Or should i just read that book about some idea that i want to understand better, you know? Or should i, should i pursue the thing that excites me and interests me, or should i, you know, meet somereu ment? You know, that's i always did the latter. So i ended up, my, my professors in psychology were thought i was great. They wanted me to go to graduate school. They deynominated me for fibeta capa. And i went to the fibeta cap inhe ceremony, and the sky came up, noly said, oh, you magna suma. I wasn't even getting on based on my grades. They just happened to have thought i was interested enough in ideas to belonged to fibit.</blockquote>

But then the other part that you are mentioning, which is the nurture, is take timed, stay with it. Stay with it awhile, and and see where that takes youa in life. I think, i think the a, the</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>the motivational engagement, results in the immersion that then creates the opportunity to obtain the expert so ewe can call itte the mozart effect, right? I mean, when i think about mozart, i think about, you know, the person who was born as the fourth member of the family string quartet, right? And a, and they handed him the violinad he was six queeks a, all right, start playing, you know, it like an a. So the level of immersion there was amazingly profound. But hopefully he also had, you know, some something. Maybe this is where the more sor of the genetic part comes in. Sometimes i think a, you know, something in him resignated to the music so that that the inergy of combination of that was so powerful. So, so that's what i really consider to be the mozart effect. It's sort of the energy of something with, with experience thatat then results in the unique flowering of a particular, you know, mind. A, so, i know, my siblings and i are all very different from each other. We've all in our own different directions. And, you know, i mentioned my younger brother, who was very musical. I had my other younger brother was like this amazing, like, intuitive engineer. A and a, my sist, one of my sisters, was passionate about and, you know, water conservation, well before it was a, you know, such a hugely important issue that it is to day. So we all sort of, somehow the find a different thing, um. And i i don't mean to say it isn't tied in with something about about us biologically, ut but it's also when that happens, where you can find that then, you know, you can do your thing, and you can be excited about it. People can be excited about fitting people on bicycles as well as excited about making their old networks achief insights into human cognitionlike</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>for me, personally, i've always been excited about love and friendship between humans.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Great question. I think that most of the time, the way the body works is the best solution. I haven't seen many alternatives, so it's hard to compare. But a, i think, you know, there's some parts of the body that make more sense than others. You know, the way our hands work, for instance. Ah, you know, the muscles are up in the forearm, and the tendons kind of come down likea strings on a puppet. And just the dexterity it gives our hands is just really amazing. And it's hard to imagine a better, a better tool than the human hand to do everything, from, you now, hold things, to play piano and do a million other daily activities that we do. One thing i talk about in the book, there's some other body parts that seem to be lacking that kind of brilliant a design, such as the throat. You know, where thea food drink are swallowed and air is inhaled. And they kind of, those two paths come within millimeters of each other, and you slip up once you laugh while eating, or you speak while trying to swallow, and you die from choking. So it seems less than optimal, though i'm not sure it could be better. From the way we're kindof formed in the womb as a beginning as the tiny little tube. I don't think it could have been done any better, or there's any other way to do it. But it is an unfortunate thing that ou kno, does lead to some problems.</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
A lot of people think the thumb is foundational to a to human civilization. In most cases too, just daily life, and your ability to get around,. take care of yourself an others. So in that way, i do think the thumb, you know, does seem like the most important many ways.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So,</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>the hand, if i could just linger on that for a second. Youd talk about the wisdom of a design in the book. What are the important things about the hand? It seems like very useful for many things, and it seems to be quite effective. A lot of people think the thumb is foundational to a to human civilization. Ah, is there any truth to that? I</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>think that is true. Actually, one of the ways in which the importance of individual fingers comes to attention is when people have severe injuries to their fingers. For instance, i have a story in the book about a guy whose thumb is nearly ripped off by his dog's leash. And you know, when we when plastic surgeons, wo are often the ones to repair thatome the dorothopetic surgeons. They will debate, you know, how important is it to save this finger, or how important is it to save, you know, let's say, the kind of tip, the one third, the tip, one third of one of your fingers. You know, t depends on the length that you'll lose, it depends on which finger. And so the thumb really is them crucial a just, you know, for your occupation. In most cases too, just daily life, um, and your ability to get around, take care of yourself an others. So, you know, theye'll be more, they're willing to go further, do more surgeries, more aggressive therapy to save a thumb, let's say, a then, you know, the tip of your pinky fingers. So in that way, i do think the thumb, you know, does seem like the most important many ways.</blockquote>

Ah, but the taboo remains. Rit society is very slow to change. What is the most fascinating part, function or concept in the human body? So youav something that fills you with awe? I</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>guess the most obvious one is the brain, partly because it's so, you know, sort of poorly understood. Though we understor understand more than we ever have in the past, there's still so much that we don't understand about how the lump of matter in our skulls kind of creates this subjective experience that we all kind of understand quite this really. That's an easy one. I would say that kidneys are an underappreciated organ. Ah, they the way they tinker with the blood stream, raise levels of this, lower levels of that, kind of, our entire lives from inside the womb until we die, is just really incredible.</blockquote>

#### ‚ú® Summary
Te thernos is a company that was basically started to revolutionize the way medical blood tests are done, both to use a whole lot less blood in doing it. You know, if anyone's ever been to the doctor and had five to ten tubes of blood removed from them, it can be quite surprising how much they take outd. In children we do draw much less blood. They have a much low blood volume, and we use these tiny little tubes to draw their blood. And we seemingly get equivalent information out of the larger tubes we draw from adults.

You know, if anyone's ever been to the doctor and had five to ten tubes of blood removed from them, it can be quite surprising how much they take outd and it's, you know, that's the limitation of our technology, that we need those volumes of blood to all the tests that we want to and so the promise of theranos was that perhaps with a single drop of blood, we would be able to know as much about the persons, the condition of their body, and without drawing all that blood. And thereby, you know, there would be these devices she was going to create that would sort of do it, you put a drop of blood in and spits out thing you ever wanted to know about what's in your blood stream. And in a way, that would make it so much easier. You know, it could be, you could have one in your home, theoretically. And you i don't know why you'd wonder what your potassium level is on any given day, but you could check if you wanted to. Ah, and so that that goal is very worthy. You know, i put that goal up there with a the frontier of making pain killers that are as good as opioids, without the addictive quality. You know, that would be such a huge revolution if we did have that in medicine. But, and particularly for me, cause i trained in both pediatrics and internal medicine, so i learned to care for both children and adults. In children we do draw much less blood. They have a much low blood volume, and we use these tiny little tubes to draw their blood. And we seemingly get equivalent information out of the larger tubes we draw from adults.</blockquote>

Returning to the ordering, is it order is a chaos to the ordering of the chapter s from throat, throat and heart and feces and genitals, all the way to fingers and toes and blood. So</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>i did mention that, you know, the throat was the first one, cause i kind of wanted to throw the reader right into the brutal honesty of death. And i followed it up with feces as the third chapter. And in a way, partly to also throw them right into the deep end of how i like discussing parts of the body and revealing their gross and fascinating aspect. So i didn't want to hide anything. You know, when you trained to be a doctor, everything is on the table, literally, in the cadaverle but also just, you know, you deal with blood and pis and vomit and fises, and that kind of the medium of your craft. And, yes, n, the medium of the craft, that's right. Right.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Like, if you're a painterth, this is the paint youwe exactly.

#### ‚ú® Summary
The main function of the heart, basically is to push blood through the carti vascer system. To get blood to your brain, you need a certain amount of pressure to get it up there. They say every red blood cell takes about five minutes tor late and come back to the heart in order to mend circulation. The biggest disconnect between how organs talked about in poetry and through history versus is actual function is probably the heart.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>mean, the main function of the heart, basically is to push blood through the carti vascer system, through the branching blood vessels, to feed every cell in the body. You know, when r believe our ancestors started off as single celled organisms floating in some ancient brew, and they were surrounded by the medium that would bring them all the nutrients they needed, so there's no issues there. Then once you start getting multi cellular organisms, the kind that are thicker, and the ones on the inside are in contact with that sort of nutritious brew that they're growing in, ah, you kind of need a way to distribute those nutrients to every cell. And so that's what the heart and the branching vascular tree do. So the heart, you know, it's, it's the most, the biggest disconnect between how the organs talked about in poetry and through history versus is actual function is probably the heart, cause we ascribe all these things, love and passion and life itself, sometimes, to the heart. But actually, it's just a simple mechanical pump, you know, that's all it is. I don't wan to down playht, it's amazing, but, you know, it just pushes, it fills theth blood and then squeezes, it fills the blood and squeezes it. And just that squeezing, that pushing, creates the blood pressure that you need to blood to every cell in your body, especially when you're standing upright? To get blood to your brain, you need a certain amount of pressure to get it up there?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Isn't it amazing to you how much volume of blood just gets pushed through by this, by this pump?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Absolutely. They say every red blood cell takes about five minutes tor late and come back to the heart mend that circulation kind that, you know, starts in the womb and continues and kind of until the moment that we die. But the volume is tremendous, and it can never, you know, take a break, basically.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Not us. Not us. Is there any improvements to the design? So a lot of people are very interested in these particular body parts. If you were to sort of step back as as a genetiis, biological designer, maybe a computer scientist, computer engineer, trying to build a human two point o, or maybe a robot, how would you improve the penus and the vagina?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Well, the penus for starters. I mean, let's also discuss the testicle. You know, they're very important too. I mean, ce yes, ough, they're fragile and they're important, and yet they're hanging off the body, in danger, basically. So, um, does that make sense? You know, they begin in the womb, they begin inside the abdomen, and they slowly descend and n sometimes before birth, sometimes in the first year of sometimes never. They pop out of the body and an up hanging in the scrotum. There's a reason, because the chemical reactions that create sperm function best at a few degrees cooler than body temperature. And so that's why you might notice in the warm weather, they might hang further down, and in the cold weather, they scrunched themselves up to get closer to the body to maintain that ideal temperature a few degrees cooler.</blockquote>

But i think that was hold over from sort of the old theory of medicine, the humoral theory, where you have to balance the fluids in the body, and so causing people to vomit, causing them to have diare or purposely taking blood out of them in blood letting was a big part. And i think the crazy use of laxatives was maybe a hold over from that time.

One is just the shapes that you see ono the wafe action, just eating away at these pieces of ice, you get these arches and just these shapes. I mean, it's just like geometry. The geometry alone is amazing. I studied math as an underground and i've always appreciated geometry a and just the shapes alone, ar just look like brilliant works of modernist art. And just obviously, no two are ever the same. Not to mention a lot of them are this unearthly blue color that is just a really startling and fastening, the same color of glaciersa, you know, in various parts of the world, that blue color is just really amazing. And i also just love how it's sort of constant shedding from our antarctic continent, from greenland. You knotice this constant process of snow falling inland and pushing the glaciers further out to sea and them breaking loose. I mean, obviously it seems to be happening faster these days, but it' sort of this constant shedding and sort of, i always like thinking bout how the body has something similar, you know, constantly shedding and renewing and rebuilding everything. And so ice is sort of this constant, similar process.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yes, i did not know you were a math underground so that, i mean, you just keep getting more fascinating.

I mean, and we now think the scientific community will now the science is really figured out. Were in way smarter than we were in the past. And then thereis these, like, interesting studies that think, robin hanson mentioned it to me that if you look at the entirety of medication, like the effect of medication on human health, if you do those kinds of broad studies, does it actually help, like toes quality of life, live a certain measures of well being, does iin look at human society as a whole, does taking medication or not actually help? And those studies find thereis no positive or negative effect if medication. And that's a very, kind of o interesting perspective. You could probably argue in a lot of ways. But the point is a cause. Cause you can bring up literally a billion cases where medication has significant positive impact on a particular patient. But you have to kind of zoom out and honestly look at possitive effects of medicine of life styled choices die, choicesof exercise or not.</blockquote>
