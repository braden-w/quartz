# Do You REALLY Need GraphQL? How to Decide Between tRPC and GQL - YouTube
- You often want a [[GraphQL]] god to make sure [[GraphQL]] [[API]] is good
- Many companies do GraphQL wrong
	- It's very easy to do bad
	- See the GitHub GraphQL API
- [[GraphQL]] is [[REST]] with extra steps
- [[tRPC]] is the barebones
- Start with [[REST]], then ask yourself if you need more complex for [[GraphQL]] or more barebones [[tRPC]]
- [[tRPC]] works better in a [[Monorepo]]
