# Humans Are Extremely Well Built for Long Distance Running
- No body fur
- Lots of sweat gland
- Narrow waist and long legs
- Large surface area of joints
- Short toes are better for pushing off than climbing trees
- We can turn our shoulder and torsos while keep our head straight
- Enormous glutes (compared to chimps and other primates) for running upright
- Arched feet for springing pushoff
