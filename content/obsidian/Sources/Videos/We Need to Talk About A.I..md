# We Need to Talk About A.I.

Narrow AI versus [[Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)]]

[[Self Driving Car Problem]] and the Trolly Problem.

Does [[Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)]] require [[Consciousness]]?

An AI that can code itself to be better, accelerates into the [[Singularity]].

Saw Stuart Russell IRL.

[[Alignment|Alignment Problem]] and the [[Paper Clip Problem]].

[[Hal Saying "I Can't Do That" is a Great Demonstration of the Threat Not Being Competence, but Alignment. Hal is Not Necessarily Evil, but Optimized for the Wrong Problem]]

## Killer Drones
Slaughterbots

> Reminds me of [[Palmer Luckey]]

Although robots could kill people, they could also minimize civilian casualties

## Discussion Questions
- Find one claim made in the movie, and try to investigate it further. What did you find?

- What did you find most compelling about the movie?

- What did you disagree with the most in the movie?
	- I agree that the [[Trolley Problem]] is important, but not necessary for self driving cars
	- There was a point that said AI would immediately desire autonomy, since humans want this and "cannot imagine serving another intelligence". However, I disagree this.
	- They said that AI would come in hundred years, but it plausibly could come much sooner
- What point do you wish had been made?

- Which of the possible threats from AI that was mentioned seems most important to you? What might convince you to change your mind?
	- Misaligned, like Hal. [[Hal Saying "I Can't Do That" is a Great Demonstration of the Threat Not Being Competence, but Alignment. Hal is Not Necessarily Evil, but Optimized for the Wrong Problem]]
	- [[Alignment|Goal Alignment Problem]]
