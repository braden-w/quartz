# The Elephant in the Brain
- What is the thesis of this book?
	- We are not just capable of follow hidden motives, but we're designed to do it. Our brains are designed for our own self-motives while not appearing selfish to other people, and in order to do so, it keeps us in the dark.
- How are we "strangers to ourselves"?
- How are brains devious?
	- They fabricate lies to distort information to us.
- Why is self-deception advantageous?
	- For the price of a little self-deception, we can "have our cake and eat it too"—enjoy the best of both worlds of acting in our self-interest without revealing our scheming nature
- What are examples of deceiving markets?
	- Art isn't just about beauty, but prestige, social circles, and sex.
	- Education isn't just about learning, but credentialism.
	- Religion isn't just about faith, but conspicuous displays of beliefs to bind people together

## In Nature
- What is [[Coalition]] Politics in Monkeys? How are animals just as political as us?
- What is the significance of primate grooming and social grooming?
	- Social grooming is a form of politics, showing trust and creating alliances.
- What is the Babbler example?
	- They go for social prestige to mate even if it seems altruistic
- How is prestige an unfair competition?
- Honest signaling and how we distinguish?
	- Healthy can distinguish themselves by going to the gym
	- Best friends can distinguish themselves by coming to weddings
- [[The Handicap Principle]]
- What are countersignals and the hierarchy of signals?
- How do [[Signaling|Signals]] change between insiders and non insiders
- How are Competitive struggles inherently wasteful?
	- Redwood should coordinate and curtail height to avoid wasteful competition. If they all collectively agreed to stop growing taller, they could save themselves so much time.
- How are foragers different from farmers?
	- More egalitarian (equality between people) and free time
- What is the relationship between brain development and the arms race of lying versus lie detecting?

## Norms
- What are [[Norms]]?
- How are norms like a Reversed [[Dominance Hierarchy]]?
	- Everyone else manages larger group
	- [[Collective Action]]
- Once we learned how to collectively take down the alpha, or punish collectively, how did this change?
	- Evolution tried to catch up, and there was way more politics: gossip and politics
- What is Axelrod's [[Meta Norm]] case?
	- It is a violation to not punish norms
- How do [[Meta Norm]]s apply to us in real life?
	- It is illegal to witness a crime and not report or do nothing

## [[Discretion]]
- Why do we risk the chance of misunderstanding by speaking with [[Discretion]]?
	- We naturally see an invisible audience (maybe because there always is a chance that there is a real one listening)
- What is [[Common Knowledge]] vs. [[Mutual Knowledge]]?
	- In [[Common Knowledge]], everyone knows that everyone knows, like using Cc instead of bcc
	- It’s the difference between gossip and publicly announcing. It's secret keeping
- What are the two axes to secret keeping?
	- How widely vs. how openly it’s known ([[Common Knowledge]] vs. [[Mutual Knowledge]])
- How do we self deceive?
	- We self deceive to think we are healthier than they are
	- [[Swimmers who self deceive themselves perform better]]
- Why do we self deceive?
	- Freudian reason is to protect the ego
	- We can't handle the truth
- But why evolve to lie to ourselves instead of boosting our egos to handle the truth?
	- For example, a general who deceived himself will die from bad planning compared to a realist one whose ego can handle the truth

## Cheating and Its Relationship to [[#Discretion]]
- Evolution has made us better at identifying cheating, and better at getting away with it to be subtle.
- What is a good example of this?
	- People who were watched even by cartoon eyes were less likely to cheat

Police officer watching open drinking vs brown paper bag

They are much more likely to be ciriticized for not doing open

Even small attempts to disguise i fractures can be worthwhile since enforcers have a lot less responsibility to enforce

Any discretion, why would you not enforce?

More difficult to prove ,paperwork , just want to wish it were not true so I don’t have to work

Pretext

False but plausibly justification to disguise true justification

Often, outwardly follows norms even though most can discretely know what’s going on

Discretion purpose?

To prevent from common knowledge
