# The Black Swan
[[The organization of narration. The king died and the queen died or the king died and the queen died of grief. Narration is good for compact packaging and also for marketing]]

# The Option That Accommodates More is Not Necessarily the More Attractive One
"Joe loves his wife. He killed her." vs. "Joe loves his wife. He killed her for her inheritance". People find the second one a better explanation, even though the first one accommodates more outcomes and is therefore more flexible

People are more willing to pay for terrorist insurance than airplane insurance even though airplane insurance includes terrorist insurance

Think: [[Confirmation Bias]], when the answer is actually a superset

As a research scientist, you finding nothing is valuable but is undervalued.

# Survivorship Bias (and Silent Evidence)
The ones who prayed and survived all are happy and proselytizes. But what about the ones who prayed and died?

"The Gulag hardens" but it actually weakens.

Think about exposing rats to poisoning: the strongest survive, giving the illusion to

It's way easier to sell "What I did for you" than "What I helped you avoid"

# Thinking in the Box Vs. Outside ([[nerds]] Vs. [[street smarts]])

## Dr. John Vs. Tony
999/1000 were heads, what's the probability of the next flip?

Dr. John: 50%, because it's given it's independent.

Tony: 99% or higher, it must be loaded.

```ad-note
title: At this point, think outside the box

Tony believes (perhaps correctly) that the chances that the given problem is loaded is higher than 99 heads in a roll.

```

An example of [[nerds]] vs. [[street smarts]]

## In Real Life, the Uncertainties Are Not Defined
The smartest are being trained to think within the confines of a game, but are not ready for the unexpected

[[Planning Fallacy]]
[[Sydney Opera House]]
[[Anchoring and adjustment]]
[[System 2 Processing]]

[[Viagra was supposed to be a hypertension drug]]

[[The law of iterated expectations - If I expect something in the future, then I already expect that something in present]]

[[Plato believed that one should use both limbs with equal dexterity]]

## Riddle of Induction and [[Problem of Induction]]
We assume that most models will be linear, whereas they could be nonlinear

A emerald is green today again, even after 1000 days, equally proves both of these hypothesis:

- The emerald will always be green
- The emerald will turn green on day 1001

But we usually lean towards the first.

An example related to the [[Narrative Fallacy]]

# Randomness is Often Unknowledge or the Absence of Knowledge
To me, the chances she has a boy or girl is 50%, but not to the doctor who had performed an ultrasound.

Use a convex configuration

It’s better to have high and low risk than only medium risk

85-90 on safest possible
10-15 percent Black Swan leveraged and high risk

Diversify the black swan investments as much as possible. Each has the potential to pay off. Even hedge funds are not diversified enough

Negative black swan businesses: Lending because a black swan leads to lost money, and good times do not reward you any extra

Positive black swan careers: Publishing, scientific research, etc.

[[Pascal’s Wager]] and while theologically flawed, has really nice broader implication : how we should value our decisions by consequence, which we do know, rather than probability, which we don’t.

Publishing and the winner-take-all nature isn't really skill, but just huge amount of luck. There's anchoring in book reviews (early book reviews influence later ones which snowballs ratings).

Both success and failure have cumulative effects. Your success leads to more success, failure too more failure, etc..

# Giants Corporations in Capitalism Are More Likely to Die Than Those in Socialism
[[Every decade, a significant portion of the S&P 500 are completely replaced]].

Capitalism, while promoting selfishness, is also very egalitarian in one way: luck plays a huge role. Socialists protected their monsters which led to them to kill more babies in the womb.

[[Embracing that somethings happen simply because of chance can be healthy]]

In US Book Sales, the [[80-20 Rule]] is more like a 97-20 rule—97% are published by 20% of authors.

![[2021-11-21 Letter to Hassaan About Black Swan, Climate Change, Nuclear Risk, Problem of Induction]]

Mandelbrot and how it’s not the discovery of the concept, but the importance of the concept that makes one famous

[[Karl Popper]] and the idea that philosophy should be motivated by problems that must be solved outside of philosophy, or else it will lose its meaningful driving impetus.
