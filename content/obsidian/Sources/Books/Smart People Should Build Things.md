# Smart People Should Build Things
- What is the pervasive view of IB and Consulting among college graduates?
	- It's a great option to try, build career capital, and you can always leave
- How do college students end up trapped in these jobs?

## Getting Grads to Take Risks
- What is Andrew Yang's explanation for why college students don't take risks?
	- Asking any individual student, would you rather have a high chance of conventional success or a relatively low chance of high success, and they will still opt for the former because of risk aversion and that they can only enjoy one future.
- What is Andrew Yang's solution for the above project of entrepreneurship?
	- Share the risk among many students.
	- Communities of students that have each other's back—if one succeeds, they will hire the others and raise them up. This nullifies the fear that one's future is not taken care
- What is the resource curse and [[Rent-Seeking]]?
	- Why did Saudi Arabia and other rich oil countries see decreasing GDP despite their rich natural resources in comparison to nearby countries?

## Detroit
- What is the significance of Detroit for startups?
	- It's a city that begs for something to do something, from the small businesses opening up at every corner to the police officers who let you make questionably legal paintings
