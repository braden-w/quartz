# Super Founders

## Education
[[Education doesn't matter for startups]]
[[Technical background doesn't matter]]

- Stanford, Harvard, MIT, Berkeley churn out most billionaire startups
	- Stanford is highest with equal numbers of CEO and CTOs
	- Harvard majority CEO
	- MIT majority CTO
- Even schools near Stanford benefited
First point: attending a top school has a correlation with higher People who went to top schools were more likely to succeed at billion, but source is dubious
Average founder has 11 years of experience
Second point: higher prestige employer correlated to higher chance of billion

[[Domain Expertise]]
Reid Hoffman
You don't need [[Domain Expertise]], a lot of creative companies should keep industry experts low
Kept financial industry experienced workers low when starting even though they didn't start
You don’t need direct work experience in industry you’re disrupting
Instead, it’s a bunch of soft skills
Fewer than 50 percent of ceos and fewer than 30 percent of cxos had direct domain experience
57 percent of CEO’s had less than one year of work experience in industry, and 70 percent had less
Different in science, where people are more familiar
Soft skills are everything

Case: Billion dollar cancer startup for two non science cofounders
They knew nothing about the industry until they entered

Almost 60 percent of billion dollar startup founders are repeat founders, even if the past startup was a failure

Of the repeat founders, 70% of repeat founders of billion-dollar companies had founded previously successful startups, versus 24% in the control group

10 million dollar valuation or acquisition

Superfounders have the ability to scale something once and do it again

Most [[Super Founders]] do not pursue startups for the money, but an obsession with building things

## Pivoting
[[Entrepreneurship#Pivot]]ing is hard, and a successful pivot is the
- The most common [[Entrepreneurship#Pivot]] is B2B to B2C, or vice versa
	- -> B2B when [[Customer Aquisition Cost (CAC)]] is too high
	- -> B2C when [[Customer Aquisition Cost (CAC)]] is too high
- [[If You Do Not Know if You Have Product Market Fit, Then You Don't Have Product Market Fit]]
- Do not fall in love with your idea

Highly differentiated devices
60 percent of startups started in large markets aka large demand (not zero to one)
Creating demand and new markets versus competing for market share
Usually small versus large market
Creating demand is actually slightly lower in valuation than competing market share (4.5 vs. 4.9 billion)
There is no necessary advantage in creating market vs market share

Man who made LinkedIn vs Affirm
Creating versus competint in market

## Timing
Timing is essential
8 search engines versus Google
Instacart did same thing as a dot com company
Snapchat succeed with timing of front cameras
There is no good way to time, there are companies that have been on ideas that have been tried 0,1, 10

This means what has been done before can be done again, and failed start-up ideas can be good inspiration

Ask them why the ideas failed, and see if failure points can be addressed

## Competition
Startup v startup often doesn't lead to success for both, like Uber and Lyft

A startup fighting a well funded startup doesn't end well, like sidecar

## Defensibility
You need it, often multiple moats
56% of billionaire startups had engineering defensibility
28% network effects, compared to 7% in random group
19% in brand, but fewer than 7% in random group. Could be important to invest but costly

### Networking Effects
If a competitor has enough critical
The best kind of app has no minimum number of users
You might be able to break in using specialized regional or targeting niche markets

## Fundraising
- Boom and bust of economy lead to different ranges of valuations
- Be strategic on forming board
- Board meetings shouldn't be presenting, but talking over issues and advice
- You might not struggle to get funding but to pick the right one
- GitHub and Atlassian didn't need fundraising
- All or nothing approach of VC's
- Why don't VC's invest in less risky startups
> There really isn't such thing as guaranteeing less risk of a startup, so we instead take advantage of the lack of ceiling of gains
- Bootstrap, grow organically on revenues

- Focus on customers, revenues, not getting funding
- Be so good you can't be ignored
- [[Let Success Chase You, Rather Than You Chase Success]]
- Focus on junior members at VCs—even they can really push you and get you to the finish line for funding
- Don't have to go to every networking event, in part from fear of making a bad impression—make yourself scarce instead

## Conclusion
Founders start at any age, and have any background
Both technical and nontechnical can create big ones, but
Solo founders are just as likely to succeed as partners
The number of cofounders doesn't affect success
More PhD's than college dropouts
Many worked at Google or McKinsey beforehand
You don't need domain expertise
Pivots were often, and you must be indifferent to your solution
Contrary to expectation, market creation did not lead to the greatest created returns

Highly differentiated had higher success
Saving consumers time or money is more likely than entertainment
Disproportionately created in markets already large, though those created in emerging ones were no less likely to succeed
It’s not about being first, but being closest to the turning point

Competition is good, also good motivation
It’s good ti fight incumbents, better than well funded startups since your chances are lower
Capital intensive we’re still successful , don’t worry about efficiency
Make them unable to ignore you
