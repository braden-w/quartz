# Lost in Translation
I am ten years old when I watch my best friend cry as she realizes she forgot how to write Chinese. Her characters’ mangled corpses litter the floor, her weapon still dripping with their blood after a flurry of violent strokes. As she curls into a little ball, I listen to her quiet sobs, trying to think of anything to say, but—I cannot relate. I will never have to endure the pain of forgetting my mother tongue. Several minutes of empty silence pass before she looks up, tears welling in her eyes.

"Do you speak Chinese?" she asks. In her glazed eyes I see only an empty reflection.

I pause. "No, but—"

I try to think of a smart reply. Something witty that could stick the landing. I need to look as smart as possible when answering the question, because I know I can only give the wrong one. But nothing I say will make the situation better. I give up.

"It's complicated."

Her head bobs in defeat, raining tears upon the papers in silent disapproval. I move to interject.

There's too many things I wanted to say. We couldn't afford to go to China or have Chinese school when I was young. Mom is Mandarin, but Dad is Cantonese. Grandma and Grandpa lost their tongues before I could use mine.

I'm fourth generation Chinese.

Suddenly, I realize I'm crying too.

Growing up fourth-generation Chinese-American in a predominantly first-generation Chinese community, I am surrounded by immigrant stories. But while the immigrant's battle to assimilate can be as brief as a generation, the war to stay connected with their roots never ends. I learned the hard way that America lives for battles, but not wars—while everyone talked about the struggle to become American, few broached the struggle to stay Chinese. To them, answering “Do you speak Chinese?” was just a simple test. To me, it was a challenge: to find my strengths, discover my missing identity, and combat scarcity. Losing the one community I had made me eager to join every other one I could.

For the next few years, I stay up late nights with my father revising English essays, dreaming that I could turn knowing one language into a strength rather than weakness. I rise early mornings with my mother for math problems. I study coding languages, fantasizing that they could replace Chinese as my other tongues. While my friends spend trips immersed abroad and enlist in prep academies, I self-study, finding adventures in books and outdoor hikes and bike rides with what my family could afford. I start signing myself up for competitions and sending emails to make new connections. Not having things handed on a silver platter made me eager to chase new opportunities.

Five years pass until I nervously enter the office of the Arcadia City Manager for the first time, my palms sticky with sweat, to discover the opportunity of a lifetime. Everything comes together. Hundreds of childhood hours wiring Arduino kits, building LEGO Mindstorm sets and PC's, and coding websites and Python programs could come together to code a new city inquiry website. My Coursera Business specialization came in handy to pitch new ideas, while ASB had prepared me to recruit and lead the student development team. Dozens of writing competitions had attuned me for writing letters. Watching everything click together to help the Arcadia community, I discover a newfound purpose.

When I return to school, I see the world through a different lens. As my friends begin forgetting their mother tongues, abandoning their culture, and priding themselves in being “all American,”  I realize that four generations simmering in this melting pot is better than one generation of blanching.  "Do you speak Chinese?" is no longer a heavy reminder—of my broken Mandarin, scarcity of opportunities, and never fitting in—but the inspiration for writing more English, chasing openings, and adapting to challenge.  Sometimes, you have to lose yourself to find yourself. And after many years of searching, I have found my calling in a life of service.

“Do you speak Chinese?”

I just smile. There’s too many things I want to say.

I am fourth generation Chinese. And I do not speak Chinese. But I can code in 5 programming languages. I still dutifully respond when my mother barks orders in Mandarin. I eat rice and dumplings and have a mad spice tolerance. And somehow, I’ve turned my greatest weakness into a source of inspiration and strength.

 “It’s complicated.”
