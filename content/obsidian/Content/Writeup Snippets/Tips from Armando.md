# Tips from Armando
Been writing for a long time when I got an email from Armando. Bless! Got an extension on the paper. This was great as I was getting a minor breakdown from all of the writing. Afterwards, I realized that I definitely should be taking it easy but also on top of all of my work.

Had a discussion with Armando. Proposed some interesting topics about intent vs. outcome. I argued that it was only intent that mattered. We talked about the man who punched someone in the heart, and mother who poisoned the baby examples. My great two questions were: people do things they know are wrong but with good intent all the time. For example, consider if the baby is starving, and the mother, even knowing that milk is poison, makes this effort with good intentions out of desperation. What if an action I do on social media still leads to a good outcome? As in I were to kill or do something very bad in a social media post, but this incites others to do good things instead? Would that morally justify the position?

Armando made some great points about how to write my essay, where to draw the line, and how to not overengineer the logic of my essays. Doing so would only lead me to a tautology. Best takeaways:

1. Theorize

2. Understand the difficulties of your position. Your position should be difficult, anything less is a tautology

3. Counterarguments should be "How do you answer?"

Call with Grace Hopper Discord. Gabe brought up [[Lamarckian Evolution]], which I joked was an incorrect theory of evolution. It was a hilarious discussion about how one could "will" oneself to gain adaptations.
