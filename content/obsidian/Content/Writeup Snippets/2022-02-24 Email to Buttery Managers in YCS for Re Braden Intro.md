# 2022-02-24 Email to Buttery Managers in YCS for Re: Braden Intro
[[Yale Computer Society|YCS]]

Hello Everyone!

My name is Braden, a young 2024 EP&E major from Grace Hopper and new addition to YCS. It’s a pleasure to meet you!

Last semester, I built the Yale Buttery Book with my suitemates. I’m now a member of the YCS Buttery team since we share a lot of things in common—I had no idea, but we've been independently working on the same problem! I currently work on Buttery Book when I can find time but wanted the next step— and we can go a lot farther if we work together!

I'll be sending requests to each of you later this weekend to meet or have a meal. We’ll talk about ways we can help you: syncing our calendars together, managing inventory, menu items, and simplifying transactions. I’m interested in your experiences as buttery managers and would like us to help you in any way you can.

Thank you all so much for your time and consideration!

Best,

Braden
