# 2022-02-23 Reaching Out to YEAs

## Sarah Shapiro
Hey Sarah! I'm forming our team leads within our organizing team and currently have the following assignments:

Media	Lakshimi Swaminathan , Alicia Cazares

Career	Mira Thakur, Christian Zada, Miriam Huerta

Socials and Office	Gian Luca Reti, Ana Sofia Viejo, Matt Burtell

Events	 Alvin Delgado (tentatively)

Growth

Based off your responses on past interest forms, I was wondering if you would be interested in leading either of the following teams—I think you would be a great fit!

1. Events: Responsible for reaching out to new speakers to attract engagement from YEA or the greater Yale community
2. Growth: Experimental team focused on growing YEA in general with coordination of all other teams, specifically media. You can create any project you want

I know you previously indicated interest in coordinating events in the onboarding form, but I also think that Growth might be a great fit as well for you, especially since you have so many ideas!

Would you also be interested in being a team lead (there will be two per team)? It's totally cool if you have other commitments!

I know you are already running Cold Take, but I also think that Growth might be a great fit as well for you, especially since you have ideas and seem invested in growing EA! Like the George Bezos idea LOL

Would you also be interested in being a team lead (there will be two per team)? It's totally cool if you have other commitments!

## GCalendar Post
Hello and welcome Organizing Team Leads! This is a crucial meeting where we will be building community and discussing a new vision for the future of YEA. We will be overviewing assignments within teams, brainstorming projects, and defining culture, priorities, and goals for the rest of the semester.

You are the next generation of YEA, and I would like to do my best to provide you the leadership opportunities and initiatives to thrive in our ecosystem.
