# YSQR Application 2020-21
1. ## Why do you want to join YSQR? (250 words max)

I am particularly interested in ethics, effective altruism, and the opportunity to create social change through the finance and tech industry. Through the mentorship and opportunity to grow under YSQR, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of finance and take opportunities to blend my experiences in YEA with YSQR to increase my social impact. Most of all, I enjoy enabling others and the journey for growth, and am excited to learn along the way!

Most of all, I enjoy enabling others and the journey for growth, and am excited to learn along the way!

2. ## What is your background in tech/finance? (150 words max)

I hope that my background in business, mathematics, and programming in high school will help serve YSQR well. After cold-emailing and interviewing with the city manager in high school, I became his first student intern and led a student development team to hand-code a website for the city to use to survey citizens.

My introduction to business/finance were state FBLA competitions, the Wharton School’s online specializations, and eventually, the Wharton School’s Leadership in the Business World Summer Program. During Leadership in the Business World, I received lectures and mentorship from Wharton staff, tours of local business enterprises and Wall Street companies, and pitched an original business plan to a panel of VC’s in a business competition, where our team won Best Presentation Award. These experiences laid a foundational knowledge in business that I hope to build upon in coming years.

3. ## What are your other commitments on campus? (Bullet/list format)

- Math 230

- Currently a board member for  Yale Effective Altruism (I was invited and accepted into their 15-person Summer Fellowship this spring as well as the Oxford University In-Depth Fellowship, and have been an active member since)

- Running for Senator/FCC representative of my residential college

- Applied to:

- Yale Computer Society

- Yale Machine Learning Society

- YUDI

- Yale Entrepreneurial Society

- ShARE Consulting

- Although the final list will likely be shorter.

- I believe I will reliably be able to invest about 3 hours per week, with the recognition that time is generally not the primary issue but priorities. I am willing to prioritize YSQR activities as important and urgent over social or other extracurricular activities when needed.

4. ## Sell yourself, [Wolf of Wall Street style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGSkYftGMrM), in no more than 50 words

What do you want?

Do you want someone who is hard-working? A person with leadership experience?

Someone you can trust?

I know who I am, but I also need to know what you want. But I am certain about this:

It won’t be about me. It will be for you.
