# YEA Exec Application

## Statement of Interest (max 200 words) \*
Really enjoyed my experience on YEA board so far! On the exec team, I am interested in exploring three problems in greater depth:

How can we start with why, and create a compelling mission for others to buy into?
How can we further foster a community of trust, transparency, and openness?
How can we nurture a culture where we are excited to come together every day?

I've really enjoyed my journey with the YEA board, and am committed to furthering the YEA community in coming semesters. I'm excited to increase my participation in logistics and commitment to the above questions!
