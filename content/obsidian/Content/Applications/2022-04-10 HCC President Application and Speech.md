# 2022-04-10 HCC President Application and Speech

## Why Are You Running for This Position?
I love the process—asking for feedback, answering people's requests, and watching their faces light up when we follow through. I want to continue helping foster a community of trust, transparency, and openness—whether it be through corresponding with HCC/Head Adams/Dean Francis and Hopper 2024, striking up random lunch conversations with other Hopplites, or asking Hopplites for feedback or just how their day is going. Through my experience as a former student body president in a 3500-student high school, I've talked to Head Adams, Angela, and Anna frequently (most notably to plan the Fall Fest), I hope to leverage my event planning ability often, and help ensure everyone feels connected. I'm excited to tackle these problems next year!

## What Ideas Do You Have for HCC That Relate to Your Position, the Council, and/or the College? (These Could Include Modifications You'd Like to Make to the Council, Events You'd Like HCC to Host, or Changes You'd Like to See in the college) *
I have had several ideas—karaoking with our speakers or pianos, walking Hopper's dogs, and playing video games or movie nights with our outdoor projector—but most importantly, I know my fellow Hopplites can create even better ideas, ones that they would be excited to attend, that would be awesome to capture and act upon.

Above all, I hope not just to bring ideas to HCC, but a system which constantly encourages, gathers, and iterates upon user feedback. A lot of this is just writing stuff down and ensuring they're actionable (so we get a lot more suggestions than just the HCC suggestion form)—in my first year, it was a small internal Hopper internal improvements to-do list (<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17l8Gyw8nyTldsczvy9y4mEEcA6XLa6T60_fdGKIFZiE/edit?usp=sharing>) that currently manages all of the feedback from my peers. One possible feature is one where Hopplites anonymously add and "upvote" items in this to-do list, further decreasing the barrier to provide feedback. I will continue checking these tasks weekly and following up within 1 week of posting. In addition, I aim to send weekly reminding blasts to encourage others to message me any advice or feedback.

Another idea I'm interested in is to frequently propose multiple ideas to Hopper at once, but to enable them to vote or rank each choice. This way, we not only are able to fully utilize HCC and Hopplites together to brainstorm ideas, but Hopplites also get input on the decision-making process, which helps increase transparency and potential attendance. It also helps us more accurately gauge interest in our event ideas.

In terms of meetings, I'm interested in running, chill, organized, laidback meetings which prioritize speed, being early, and fun to attend meetings—I'll be gathering feedback regularly from attendees to ensure that they're always a joy to be here. I'm also interested in starting an event-planning committee that meets weekly with the SAC chairs to block off time to plan events (which has supercharged the rate of planning in my other clubs)

## Speech
Hi everyone! My name is Braden, and it's a pleasure to be speaking with you today.
1. I'm running for HCC because I believe that we have the ability to make a profound difference on students lives
	1. Events that Julia and I planned with HCC, Fall Fest, Hopper Formal, shape the way we view our college experience. It's one of the reasons why we go outside every morning and are proud to be in Hopper
2. And I also believe it starts here, where the meetings happen. I believe that planning good events starts with having exceptionally awesome meetings, where we feel productive, organized, chill, and relaxed. Not just focused on what we do, but how we feel do while doing it
		1. Meetings that respect your time
		2. Meetings that respect your energy
		3. We have food, let's make it a good time
	2. I'm not saying that we don't have that now, but what I am saying is that I'll be constantly requesting for feedback that challenge my assumptions on what you want
		- For example, what is the ideal length of an HCC meeting? Do our meetings start at a reasonable time? Are questions of the day running longer than expected? More free time to mingle?
		- This is the time that you are dedicating to HCC. It should be respected
		- What are the reasons you attend?
3. I could talk about my experiences as Student Body President of a school of 3500 students, we averaged an event per month for the whole year.
	- But above any promise, is that I can give is that I grow and respond to feedback, and that I believe in this organization.
	- That's why you see me active on the Groupme
	- That's why I dropped YCC to run for HCC
	- That's why I attend almost all the meetings this year unless I'm literally off campus
	- That's why I can endure 20-email long chains with Head Adams and Angela McCray and dining staff to get us logistics locked down
	- That's why in the beginning of the school year, when there was a communication mishap with Kate and me, I planned the entire Fall Fest by myself

There is no motive for me to do things just to get elected. There is no motive for me to talk a lot
2. What I can guarantee
	1. Document stuff
	4. Experience from Student Council
- It's a platform for growing and sharing a moment
- A platform for planning, more leadership positions
