# Foothills
Mrs. Holcomb. Ms. Golhardt. Mrs. Van Haaster. Mr. Morton. Ms. Dillman. Mrs. Murphy. Mrs. Chin. Mr. Wasburn. Mr. Renfrew. Mr. McCulley. Mrs. Moore. Mr. Van Haaster. Mr. Acker. Dr. Hillman. I will remember these not only as names, but as the mentors who have helped me discover my interests and create wonderful memories at Foothills.

Thank you, Mrs. Holcomb and Ms. Golhardt, for the adventures in Speech and Debate club and Math club, which prepared me for the high school teams.

Thank you, Mrs. Van Haaster, for Yearbook and introducing me to freelance journaling under the Arcadia Pow Wow newspaper.

Thank you, Mr. Morton, for providing amazing field trips and a community in orchestra.

Thank you, Ms. Dillman, for introducing me to student council, where we would meet again in high school.

Thank you, Mrs. Murphy, Mrs. Chin, and Mr. Washburn, for the daily journaling, group projects, and essays that inspired me to enter creative writing competitions.

Thank you, Mr. Renfrew, Mr. McCulley, and Mrs. Moore, for the acceleration that inspired me to learn AP Calculus in 9th grade.

Thank you, Mr. Van Haaster, for demonstrating the "One Left" game at WEB training and inviting others to find the winning strategy. Cracking the game using number theory was one of the most enthralling experiences I've ever had (I still wish I was called to play you that day, but not being called inspired me to code a simulation in Python, which was equally exciting!).

Thank you, Dr. Hillman and Mr. Acker, for presenting the Rotary Student of the Year award, a day my family and I will never forget, and an inspiration for me to always strive to be greater.

One of my fondest memories at Foothills come from adventures with the custodian, Mr. Vasquez. Every day during silent reading period since 7th grade, a group of my friends—Frank, Jerry, Kenneth, and Evelyn—met from across the school to help him work after lunch. Together, we enjoyed an experience that was not only humbling and incredibly fun (to this day, I am still wicked fast at tying bags), but an opportunity for camaraderie and service. After we finished, we would sit down in a circle, sodas graciously provided by Mr. Vasquez, and discuss. Precious moments like those defined my Foothills experience—students from different backgrounds, coming together for special moments—and are ones I will cherish fondly and forever.

To me, the Foothills Middle School Scholarship is not about me or my accomplishments, but my journey as a student and celebrating the figures who have contributed to my development. At Yale, I plan to major in the [[Economics]] & Computer Science joint major, adding a second major in Mechanical Engineering or Data Science and Statistics. As I explore and enter the adult world, I will carry with me, cherish, and always remember the communities, mentors, and memories that I made at Foothills Middle School.
