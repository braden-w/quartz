## Briefly Describe Your Background in Computer Science. What Kinds of Programming Experiences Have You Had?
I've been programming ever since my uncle bought me my both programming book! It started out with a little bit of Visual Basic (unfortunately the books were quite old), then branched out to some Python programs, Java, Web Dev, and more.

In terms of experience, I am currently most comfortable with Python automation and web development! I led a 3-person student programming team in hand-coding a website for the city, and have been automating many several tasks with Python and API's. I have taken AP CS courses, CS50, Google Cloud specializations, and a Google Data Structures and Algorithms Course at Computer Science Summer Institute-Coursera. Of course, I'm here to venture beyond my comfort zone, and I'm excited to challenge myself!
