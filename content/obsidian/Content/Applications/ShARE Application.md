## (Optional) Background or Interests You Want Us to Consider When Placing You in a Team?
I am particularly interested in ethics, effective altruism, and the opportunity to collaborate and create impact. I hope that my experiences and skillsets serve ShARE well in helping and enabling others.

This summer, I've been involving myself in numerous ways to learn more about ethics and how to do good most effectively in the world. Although I'm a first year, I am currently a board member of Yale Effective Altruism (I was invited and accepted into their Summer Fellowship in senior year high school as well as the Oxford Uni In-Depth Fellowship, and have been an active member since). I hope to blend my experiences in YEA and ShARE to identify and learn more about how to increase my social impact. I enjoy enabling others and the journey for growth, and am excited to learn along the way!

## What Other Groups Will You Be Involved in This Semester? \*
I am currently a board member of Yale Effective Altruism (I was invited and accepted into their Summer Fellowship in senior year high school as well as the Oxford Uni In-Depth Fellowship, and have been an active member since) and am currently interested in running for Senator or FCC representative of my residential college, Yale Computer Society, Yale Machine Learning Society, YUDI, and Yale Entrepreneurial Society, although the final list will likely be far shorter.

I believe I will reliably be able to invest about 5 hours per week, with the recognition that time is generally not the primary issue but priorities. I am more than willing to prioritize ShARE activities as important and urgent over social or other extracurricular activities when needed.
