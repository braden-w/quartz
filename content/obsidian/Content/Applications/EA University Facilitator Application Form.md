# EA University Facilitator Application Form

## What Do You Think Are the Risks of Poorly Facilitated EA Discussions? (~100 words) \*
A lack of clarity or failure to distill the essence of the discussion. EA discussions generally are self-propelling, and I believe good discussion facilitators can best enhance discussion through encouraging others to reiterate their thoughts. This enables people to think critically through properly summarizing positions, and enables them to engage with other ideas more effectively.

## What Techniques and Norms Do You Think Could Mitigate These Risks? (~200 words) \*
I hope to empower and embolden discussion participants to think critically and share their thoughts, even if (and perhaps especially if) contrarian. I believe that discussions should embrace friction when practiced properly; I would argue that the alternative of avoiding it leaves participants ill prepared and more likely to escalate arguments in the future.

## The Group Discussion Begins to Go Considerably Off-topic, From a Specific EA Cause Area to General Career Plans. How Would You Respond? (~100 words) \*
I would be generally receptive of topic changes, as I find them to be some of the most enjoyable parts of EA discussions. However, given the question implies that the discussion goes considerably off-topic, I would gently remind the participants that we have a duty to discuss the EA cause area. I would be happy to help lead the discussion on EA career plans afterwards, outside the scope of the fellowship.

## A Strong Disagreement Emerges Between Two Participants, Who Have Opposing Views on Long Termism. How Would You Respond? (~100 words) \*
I would encourage both participants to identify the crux of their disagreement and summarize their own and the other's position. I believe that remaining composed while engaged and excited in mindset is crucial to keeping the discussion fun and engaging. To have disagreement can be a wonderful thing, and I hope to signal that as I help facilitate this discussion. Practicing empathy—not the emotional kind, but the cognitive understanding of another's position—will be my priority, both as a facilitator and for the participants.
