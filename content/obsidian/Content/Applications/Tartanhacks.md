# Tartanhacks

## Why Do You Want to Attend TartanHacks? \*
I absolutely love building things--there nothing quite like discovering a solution by oneself and seeing it implemented from start to finish. These moments, of immense clarity and euphoria, are what I live for.

In high school, I enjoyed math and essay writing, but programming is an entirely different beast--it allows one to create a living tangible product, one that breathes and responds to every change, until you get it just right.

During winter break, I picked up front-end development with Vue, Nuxt.js, and Vuetify, falling in love with the ability to rapidly prototype apps. I hope to participate in TartanHacks to continue my passion of building things, and earn a valuable experience along the way!
