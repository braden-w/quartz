# Yale Entrepreneurship Society

## What Excites You Most About Entrepreneurship?
The thrill of discovery. There nothing quite like discovering a solution by oneself and seeing it implemented from start to finish. These moments, of immense clarity and euphoria, are what I live for. I hope to find them through entrepreneurship–the opportunity to create a living tangible product, one that breathes and responds to every change, until you get it just right.

## What is a Project or Accomplishment You Are Most Proud Of? Why?
Campaigning for student council. When I first ran, I hoped to run for a minor position–I had lost four of five elections in middle school. But when the clipboard landed on my lap, every position overflowed except president, where there was only the incumbent whom nobody dared oppose. I took a deep breath.

One decision led to thousands, and one decision—to go beyond my comfort zone—changed my life.

## If You Were to Start a Start-up Today, What Problem Would You Tackle?
I would tackle the application of AI/data ownership in the education sector to expand education across the world. Using data ownership as an income stream—imagine being paid to learn. This has massive economic implications, especially in underdeveloped countries. Ideally, the opportunity cost of a job wouldn't be unemployment, but a steady stream of cash from learning new skills.

## Who is Your Favorite Entrepreneur and Why? or What is Your Favorite Start-up and Why?
Besides Elon Musk, I really enjoy George Hotz, well known as one of the first jailbreakers of the iPhone. His company, comma.ai, is seeking to revolutionize the self-driving car space through enabling any car to be self-driving with a camera setup and open source software. He has an incredible (hacker-man) personality and character to listen to on podcasts and tutorials.

## What Are You Looking to Gain Out of YES This Year?
Inspiration, community, and exposure to the challenges of entrepreneurs. I am especially interested in impact. I'm currently a board member of Yale Effective Altruism (as an incoming first-year, I was invited to their fellowship this summer) and am interested in ethics and maximizing global impact. I hope to blend my experiences in YEA and YES to identify and learn more about high-impact startups.

## Why Would You Be a Good Fit for YES?
I hope that my experiences and skillsets in leadership, business, writing, and STEM will be serve the club well in helping and enabling others. I enjoy enabling others and the journey for growth, and am excited to learn along the way!
