# 2022-02-14 Yale in London and Study Abroad Applications

## London
I am drawn to Yale in London as an opportunity to explore and fulfill my personal aspirations to study abroad, academically enrich myself, and connect with the global Effective Altruism movement.

Since I first joined Yale, I have intended to fulfill my dream of traveling abroad during my Yale career. I have never traveled outside of North America, in part due to a combination of family financial and logistical complications during my childhood. Although traveling to Asia has been extremely difficult during the COVID-19 pandemic, the opportunity to travel to London under a structured curriculum at Yale is incredibly exciting and literally a dream come true.

Logistically, this is my most ideal summer to study abroad (with London being the ideal city of travel). Unlike my first-year summer, I have kept my sophomore summer open and free from all commitments to reserve it for personal exploration. Coincidentally, I have been invited by the Forethought Foundation to apply to a course taught at Oxford University, "Topics in Economic Theory & Global Prioritization", to take place on August 20, only a week after the end of Yale in London this summer. Travel to and from the course would be paid for by the Forethought Foundation. This summer's travel window is uniquely convenient in enabling Yale in London and this program to take place back-to-back (with transportation provided).

Furthermore, I am drawn to Yale in London for its proximity to the broader Effective Altruism community. Since my first year at Yale, I have become heavily involved in Yale Effective Altruism, the Yale branch of the Effective Altruism movement. The community has been instrumental in helping me maximize my career impact, find friends, and enjoy deep and philosophical discussions. Since Effective Altruism was founded at Oxford University in London, the city has become the heart of the Effective Altruism community. I look forward to visiting the Effective Altruism community at Oxford and London, attending events, and having some wonderful discussions with student organizers!

During the program, I preliminarily intend to enroll in "The British Country House: Collecting and Display" under Martin Postle, and am drawn to the opportunity to expand my academic education to art and the humanities. Not only will the course potentially fulfill a needed humanities requirement in my distributional requirements, but it seems to be a great foray into the art world, an area that I have very little exposure to in my recent Computer & Psychology Courses. For these reasons and the above, I am excited and hope to study abroad at Yale in London for Summer 2022.

## Croatia
I am drawn to History & Culture of Southeastern Europe as an opportunity to explore and fulfill my personal aspirations to study abroad, academically enrich myself, and connect with the global Effective Altruism movement.

 Studying abroad will fill a gap in my knowledge by recent Computer Science & Psychology Courses.
