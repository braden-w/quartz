# The Patch

## Letter to Tom
Hello Tom! I’m Braden, a referral from Cian and incoming freshman to Yale University planning to double major in Economics & CS and Statistics & Data Science. Cian and I had a fascinating conversation yesterday on economics, AI, and Effective Altruism, and he recommended that I reach out to you and apply for Patch!

I just had a quick question: at Patch, is there room for longer-term research projects/roadmaps/advocacy, or is there a stronger emphasis on MVPs and rapid growth? I’m very impressed by the program and would love to be a part of it, but I also want to make sure that my ideas can serve you and the program’s mission.

I have a project that I am quite passionate about, but it is more so a vision for the future than a specific project (it may be accomplished through advocacy, projects, etc., but requires direction). Would it be acceptable if I fleshed this out in my application, or would it be safer to go with an app idea?

Regardless, I just wanted to express how awesome I believe the work you’re doing is. I heard you’re working with a startup providing 25% of COVID tests in California, which is super rad (I’m from southern California :) ) Thank you so much for your time!

## What is Your Background? *
I'm drawn to tackling education and economic development with artificial intelligence. I competed nationally in math, writing, speech & debate, and business in high school and took several risks that led me to becoming student council president and valedictorian. I love self-studying and improving myself! In quarantine, I'm developing my technical skills. I’m an incoming freshman to Yale University planning to double major in Economics & CS and Statistics & Data Science.

## Tell Us About a Time You Did Something Outside the Box. It Can Be Anything! *
Running for freshman student council. I hoped to run for a minor position, having lost four of five elections in middle school (I won the last only because it took second place). But when the clipboard landed on my lap, every position overflowed except president, where there was only the most popular candidate, the incumbent, whom nobody dared oppose. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.

One decision led to thousands, and one decision—to take a chance beyond my comfort zone—changed my life.

## Describe One Major Challenge You Have Faced, and How You Overcame It. *
Though I was a precocious tennis player, a recurring hip injury became a mental crutch, and I failed tennis tryouts all 3 times. Having invested many hours of practice, I was emotionally shattered.

Slowly, I realized pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional. I took back control of the narrative, and exercised into the best shape of my life. Perhaps I was never meant to be part of the tennis team, and sometimes there is no silver lining in failure—but I've become much stronger in return.

## What Projects Have You Worked on so Far? If You Have Won Any Awards or Have Done Any Work You Are Proud Of, Please Include That Too. *
Self-Guided Projects

Reactive Todo List using Vue Framework, Google Firebase, and GCP (current)

City internship: recruited & led student dev team to design responsive full-stack inquiry website

Automated Python script using HTTP POST, JSON, and Pocket API to batch delete entries by tag in Website

Project-Based Courses

Harvard CS50

Cloud Engineering with Google Cloud 5-Course Specialization (w/ Guided Projects)

Data Engineering with Google Cloud 6-Course Specialization (w/ Guided Projects)

## What Are Your Skills and What Are You Good At? *
Learning, reverse-engineering: I learn especially well in a practical setting for this reason

Self-studying: I self-studied the AP Calc & Chemistry and Physics & Econ exams in freshman and junior year

Leadership: As president, I led school events for ~4,000 students

Programming (relatively speaking; much to learn in college)

Persistence to hunt for bugs

Web Dev

Python

Public speaking: I delivered a president and valedictorian speech to 4000+ in two assemblies w/ strong positive reception

## What is the Idea You Would Like to Work on During Patch? *
168 Hours

Unlike most time-tracking apps, this app performs time budgeting that counts down, not up. Solves problems like "I want to spend >x hours reading" or "<y hours on YouTube" per week. User allocates # of hours per activity per week (default 168 hours "free time"), and the app timer counts the current activity towards the budget (default "free time). It's a dashboard with horizontal digital hourglasses. Penalties or incentives for running down/over the clock with optional break intervals like Pomodoro.

It's time blocking without the per-day rigidity of a calendar, designed for habits.

## What Stage is Your Idea At? *
Planning. I'm learning Flutter for cross-platform mobile dev and building a reactive To-Do List project to develop my web abilities. I began drafting sketches for UI and measurable features for a MVP.

## If You Have Any Other Ideas You Considered Applying With, Please List Them Here
Using data ownership as an income stream—like YouTube paying you a share of your data's worth to its ML models—in education. Ideally, the opportunity cost of a job wouldn't be unemployment, but a guaranteed stream of cash from learning new skills (kind of like a bilateral/capitalist UBI).

Email and phone may be different during summer break (hence I am including two)

## Who (aged 16 - 20) Do You Know That You Would Be Most Excited to Find Out Was Also in Your Fellowship Class? Why? *
Partner: Joseph Chen - We have a symbiotic relationship: he has many internships and work opportunities while I have more academic/theoretical knowledge. We work together on projects and are able to play off each other's strengths and weaknesses.

Friends: Samuel Berkun, Sandra Tang, Jason Chan - I've worked with them personally on several projects in high school (in Coding Club and on the city manager project), so I know their strengths.

Inspiration: William Lin - Competitive programmer on YouTube going to MIT whom I really admire!

## Where Did You Hear About Patch? Did Someone Encourage You to Apply? Who? What Convinced You to Apply to Patch? *
Cian and I had a fascinating 2-hour call on economics, AI, and Effective Altruism, and he told that the Patch would be a great fit for me! He referred me to Tom and recommended I submit an application here.
