# [[2022-04-24]] Questions for Student Milestone Fund
Related: [[Yale Buttery Book]], [[Applications]]

## Which Best Describes the Current Stage of Your Idea?
- "My idea is now is up and running, and available to users. At least some users/customers are actively engaging with it.”

## What is Your initiative/idea Category? *
- For-profit
- Non-profit
- Hybrid (for-profit and non-profit)
- Initiative/Program/Event
- I don't know yet

## In 50 Words or Less, Describe Your Idea. *
While Yale’s residential college butteries are an amazing resource for late-night cravings and socializing, there has never been a centralized collection of operating hours and menus across all 14 butteries and 2 student-run cafes. The Buttery Book provides a digital solution for students, compiling accurate buttery times and detailed offerings.

## What Milestone or Goal Will Funding From the Student Milestone Fund Help You Achieve? How So? (max 200 words) *
As excited entrepreneurs and students who strongly believed in the benefit our idea would have on fellow friends, we covered all initial operating costs with money out of our own pockets. Funding from the Student Milestone Fund will not only help us balance our outstanding expenses but also guarantee that the app and website can continue to be online and updated all through the next year. 

## What is the Unmet Need or Pain Point Your venture/initiative/project Addresses? (max 150 words) *
Students in a given college don’t have easy access to information about other butteries. Since they can only be in one residential group chat college, and since friends might not always be available, students don’t have definite avenues of figuring out if another buttery is open or determining if the food is even worth visiting. Lack of information about most butteries means inefficiencies in securing late-night food in their busy schedules. 

## What Makes Your venture/initiative/project Innovative? How Have the Successes and Failures of Others Within the Same Sector, Geography, or Demographic Informed Your Work? (max 200 words) *
We innovate on improving the social experiences of Yale students by increasing the likelihood students will think about butteries and check out butteries. In addition to fulfilling the unmet need of supplying buttery information, there is a missed opportunity for more Yale students to visit butteries outside of their own college. By improving the accessibility of butteries across all the colleges, we increase the chances students can successfully catch a buttery and its food options when they are exploring other colleges.

As far as we know, the Buttery Book is the first app to address the problem of a missing centralized source for Yale buttery times and menus. The success of the app solving the most similar sector, Yale Menus on iOS, showed us that by consolidating useful information and presenting it in a clear way, people who need the information would appreciate and use our app. 

## What Will the Impact of Your venture/initiative/project Be? How Do You Plan to Measure the Success and/or Impact of Your venture/initiative/project? Be Specific as to How You Will Measure traction/impact. (max 200 words) *
Buttery Book aims to make it easier for students to eat healthy and delicious food on campus. By increasing the convenience and accessibility of information about butteries, we hope to increase foot traffic and encourage butteries to stay open for longer. Ultimately, we hope that students will use Buttery Book to eat healthier meals and reduce food waste on campus. Our main metric for success will be the number of page views and app downloads. However, we also plan to survey students about the impact of our app on their eating habits.

## Who is Your Target audience/customer/user? How Many Potential customers/users Have You Spoken to Thus Far? What Have You Learned From Them? (max 200 words) *
Before officially launching our app, we tested the concept and UI by showing it to some friends. For our launch, we sent an email blast to the nearly seven thousand undergraduates making up the Yale College student body. We’ve learned about what makes features easier or harder to use, for example, ___. We’ve also heard lots of comments, through official Buttery Book report channels and through casual conversation, that certain butteries have closed early one semester or that a menu can be updated. This has led us to brainstorm and prototype methods to better receive and automatically update new information.

## Describe the Traction You've Achieved to Date. (max 200 words) * Please Describe in 200 Words or Less. [OPTIONAL] Attach Any Relevant Evidence of Your Traction to Date. If There's a Link, Include it in the Description Above. Please Know, the Maximum File Size is 10MB.
We’ve achieved more traction than we could have imagined. On a given day, friends and classmates who are seeking refuge in food will spontaneously pull out their phones to check what butteries are open and what food is available. To date, almost 9000 people have visited the Buttery Book website, and over 500 have downloaded the iOS app. We’ve also received coverage from local news outlets.
