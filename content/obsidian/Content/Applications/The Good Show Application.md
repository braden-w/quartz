# The Good Show Application

## Favorite Cartoon Show
Sonic X (GOTTA GO FAST)

## Favorite Insult
"Don't put yourself down. That's my job." Also, not really an insult but a pickup line: "Are you a toaster? Because I want to take a bath with you."

## Favorite Way to Hide Your Sadness
Smiling :D

## The Least Fun Fact About Yourself
My legs are almost completely hairless, to the fascination (and jealousy) of my friends :P

## Obviously Zoom is Terrible, but to You, What's the Worst Part?
Can't hang out with professors :/ but at least I've had a lot of really random hilarious convos in crusty Zoom chats

## If You Could Interview Anyone in the Context of a Late-night Comedy Show, Who Would You Interview and Why?
Besides Elon Musk, George Hotz. Besides his potentially game-changing startup in self-driving cars, he is literally a real-life hackerman. His coding twitch streams have so much chaotic energy that they could pass for movies 👌 Ideally, I would like to have him next to Lex Fridman, a very methodical and orderly Russian machine learning researcher, and see how they play off each other

## Briefly Describe a Potential Fake Guest Sketch and What the Main Joke Would Be. By Fake Guest, We Mean a Character Like You Would See on SNL’s Weekend Update (Stefan, Drunk Uncle, a Dating Consultant, etc.)
Steve the Harvard grad, whose main joke is that his biggest personality trait is the fact that he went to Harvard B) dude constantly drops H bombs and talks about Harvard for no reason like bro chill out we get it 😂
