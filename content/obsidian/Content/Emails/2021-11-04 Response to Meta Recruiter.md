# 2021-11-04 Response to Meta Recruiter
Hi Danielle!

Thank you so much for reaching out about this opportunity! It is an honor to be considered for Meta, and I hope that my experience and excitement for their mission can serve them well. Here are my responses:

1. May 2024 expected graduation. I’ve attached a newly-revamped copy of my resume.

2. No, I do not have other interviews at the moment.

3. Yes, I am eligible for an internship!

Thank you so much for your time and consideration! I’m available to contact via this email or the phone number on my resume. Please let me know if there’s anything else I can do to make your life easier.

Best,

Braden
