## Bulk Changes to YAML
For members who may be looking to edit YAML as a Database or Table-like view, [Obsidian DB Folder](https://github.com/RafaelGB/obsidian-db-folder) has been a helpful extension for me to see YAML of files in a folder in a Notion-Like database.

For bulk edits, I would still recommend using regex or a Python script using the [Frontmatter Module](https://python-frontmatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), and Obsidian DB Folder is useful for visualizing YAML metadata.
