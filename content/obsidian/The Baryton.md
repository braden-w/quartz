# The Baryton
The Baryton is a peculiar instrument. It is a stringed instrument, played primarily with a bow, incorporating many of the properties of both the guitar and the cello. One could liken its appearance to the cello, its elegant contour modified with six strings, an additional plank that extends the neck to the right (from the performers view), and a wooden bridge that is offset appropriately to the left side to accommodate the widened neck. All six wooden pegs are located on the left side. Though it may lack the symmetry of the cello, there is still a classical charm in its wooden finish, shape, and similar design language. If anything, there is a nostalgic air, if not statement, to its asymmetry. Haydn popularized the instrument, writing 170 pieces for it in the 1700s.Â Beyond that, the Baryton is a rare instrument, and it is not often seen in modern performances. The instrument itself is a curiosity, an interesting subject precisely because of its rarity and aesthetic appeal.
