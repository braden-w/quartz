# F-35 Is Misunderstood and Actually a Great Aircraft
- The F-35 is not a slow and un-maneuverable aircraft
  - It's actually more maneuverable than a clean [[F-16]] and [[F-18]]
- Was hampered by early issues and software limitations that tainted public perception
- It actually costs less than 4.5 G aircraft (although maintenance is higher)
- Software and sensor suite is top notch, the best
- Very fast turn rate with a powerful engine to regain energy after turn
- The F-35 Program is the most successful program since the F-16
