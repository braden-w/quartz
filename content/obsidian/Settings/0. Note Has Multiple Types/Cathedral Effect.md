# Cathedral Effect
Higher ceilings increase creativity, lower ones increase focus.

> Focused and analytical work: low ceiling space.
> Creative work: high ceiling environment.

> When we are in a small space, we are more restricted. If there is a lot of space, we go to more abstract thinking.
> If you need analytical work, and the space is too broad or ceiling too high, you can put on a hat. It restricts the visual angle and focus.
