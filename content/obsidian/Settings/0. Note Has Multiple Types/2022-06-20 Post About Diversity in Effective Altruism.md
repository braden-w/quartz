# [[2022-06-20]] Post About Diversity in Effective Altruism
On the topic of diversity: YEA is one of the most diverse EA groups out there, and one of the biggest shockers for me when I first engaged with the broader EA community was the stark contrast and lack of diversity.

EA as a global movement could be more inclusive as a whole. The current composition of the movement may bias itself to remain this way—while it’s great for friends to refer their friends, it’s plausible that this expansion mechanism could also reinforce a lack of diversity (the same could be said about recruiting from top universities). A way to counteract this could be to make an orchestrated effort to make diversity a value of the organization (YEA has done this in past and current years)
Perhaps this stems from an issue of accessibility—EA topics, or the method they are expressed, are more accessible when one is from a position of privilege. A possible explanation that I have anecdotally observed is that a person is more likely to think about altruism and the world the more of one’s needs have been met (Maslow’s hierarchy of needs). This tends to lead to an over representation of highly privileged groups within the movement.
