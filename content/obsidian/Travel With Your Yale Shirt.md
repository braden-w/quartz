# Travel With Your Yale Shirt
“Hi everyone! Might be too late for this weekend’s travel needs but generally when my Yale ‘20 daughter returned to CT she would wear a Yale shirt on the flight and at least half of the time would come across a fellow Yalie at the airport who would split an Uber or Lyft back to New Haven”
