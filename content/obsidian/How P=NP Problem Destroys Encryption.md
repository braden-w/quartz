# How [[P=NP Problem]] Destroys Encryption
Current encryption relies on the fact that verification is [[P=NP Problem#P Polynomial Time Problems]], but decryption is [[P=NP Problem#NP More Than Polynomial Time Problems]]. If these are the same, then there is nothing stopping decryption being just as fast as verification
