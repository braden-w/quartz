# The Problem with [[Feature Representations]] and Feature Extraction
We can use [[Feature Representations]], like [[Color Histogram]] or [[Bag of Words Approach]], and even use combinations of feature representations. However, these were techniques of early 2010s. At the end, we still use a [[Linear Classifier]].

Instead, we can try building a deep single end-to-end pipeline that takes all the raw input on one side (pixels) and on the other side, spits out the output. This is a [[Neural Network]].
