# A Shithead Guide On Successfully Applying To Jobs
Because [[Referrals are king]] and this is one of the best resources I've seen on this.

## Example Request
> I am messaging you because I am interested in a job at Spotify. These roles I have sent below seem like a great fit for me (send roles after sending the intro message), and, I would love if you could refer me. I am a newgrad interested in backend development with a focus in data engineering, and I have some experience under my belt that I think would be beneficial to Spotify. [insert line about your qualifications; seriously, Keep It Simple, Stupid]. Thank you so much for everything, and have a great day!"
