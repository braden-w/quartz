    Engineering Jokes
        "The optimist says the glass is half full, the pessimist says the glass is half empty. The engineer says the glass is twice as big as it needs to be." Best.  quote. ever.    #Joke
        A mathematician, a physicist, and an engineer were all given a red rubber ball and told to find the volume.  The mathematician carefully measured the diameter and evaluated a triple integral.  The physicist filled a beaker with water, put the ball in the water, and measured the total displacement.  The engineer looked up the model and serial numbers in his red-rubber-ball table.    #Joke
