Comforting Thoughts for Regret and Failure
    Avoid getting hurt twice. First for not doing it, and second for dealing with the repercussions.
    How to Get Out
        1.Own It
        2. Just for fun
    Let Go
        If you're holding onto something, you can't receive anything. Release your hand
You’re alone in this world
    The average number of times anyone in this audience thinks about you a day is 0. The average person does not have enough time to be thinking about you, but thinking about themselves. That is the most beautiful things ever.
    Everyone is pushing and pursuing their own agendas. 
        It’s not a thought you should fear, you should use it to push yourself towards full self reliance and freedom. 
        It’s liberating.

    Zero Sum Mindset
        Praise others. It will bring them peace of mind.  Do not expect others to praise you. It will bring you peace of mind.  
My silence is a choice. Silence is not the absence of thought, but its ultimate manifestation.

Writing
    Write It Like an Email
        There was an experiment a couple of decades back that teachers conducted. They gave their students two assignments:
        a) Write a composition on paper
        b) Write on the same topic in an email
        They  were surprised to find that almost everyone scored higher in writing  the email. There was something about this medium of typed text that  released the burden off of the kids’ chests and allowed them to be  natural. They didn’t use too many fancy words, and they just said what  they wanted to say in an organic, direct way.
        I’ve  found that a great way to start writing a new blog post is to tell  yourself that you’re writing an email to an old friend after one or two  glasses of wine.
What has been done before, can be done again (The story of the four minute mile)
    Why do you think we remember the first, but not the second? Following pushed boundaries is natural of human condition. Likewise, it is important to leverage this to our advantage. Read about other people's stories.
