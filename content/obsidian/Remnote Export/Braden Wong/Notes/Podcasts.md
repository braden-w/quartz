Breathe through nose, not mouth
    Breathing out of mouth releases 40% more than nose
    Nose takes in 20% more oxygen than equivalent through mouth
    Tape up mouth, through nose
    Exhales should be completely in and out
        The body needs a balance of CO2 and O2, not enough CO2 is a bad thing
        Breathe normally and slowly
        Hypoventilation: double breathe out and then breathe in while running
            What triggers a need to breathe is not Oxygen, but CO2

                Reinvention, trying to approach the problem by yourself. You gain a bunch of inarticulatable intuitions around the topic, formulations of counterexamples, etc.

     The 2 Types of Growth: Which Growth Curve Are You Following?
        Type 1: Logarithmic Growth Curve
            https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/zY2wQbhgnAe91dOnw0BNbxAHX4KhARRpDOc21jzcjE6gEEM1nSjwL8hAnelWvkqXO-EMbMw34EPNwu2X9YSuWuuoI6FhtILGnrZIoZ0bTKp7hTaTmWgvgN_Kp65gKLBq
            examples
                Fitness and Strength Training: The “beginner gains” come quickly at first, but then it becomes more difficult to get stronger each week.
                Literacy: Children and young students make massive leaps as they learn how to read. Meanwhile, college students and well-educated adults have to put in a focused effort to expand their vocabulary beyond commonly used words.
                Language proficiency: Learning how to speak even a rudimentary level of a new language opens up a whole new world. However, there are only meager gains left for fluent speakers to discover.
                Weight Loss: It may be relatively easy to shed five pounds within a week or two, but then the progress slows. Each successive pound of fat loss is more stubborn than the last.
                Musical skill: Improvements come quickly for a novice guitar player. Improvements come very slowly for a concert pianist.
        Type 2: Exponential Growth Curve

            examples
                Investments and wealth: Thanks to the power of compound interest, your retirement savings start out as a small treasure in the early years, but balloon in size during the final decade or two of savings.
                Email subscribers and website traffic: New websites receive just a trickle of traffic here and there, but as the weeks and months roll on those trickles can build into a raging river of visitors and subscribers.
                Entrepreneurship and business growth: The assets that you build for your business stack on top of one another and revenue compounds throughout the life of a successful business.
                Social media followers: When you only have 100 followers, getting another 100 followers may take six months. Once you have 1,000 followers, however, getting the next 100 may only take one month. Once you have 100,000 followers, getting another 100 probably takes one day. Your growth rate snowballs.
