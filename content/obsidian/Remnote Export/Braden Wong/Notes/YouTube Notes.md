 An Actual Review of Titanfall 2 - YouTube #Gaming
    A mediocre game done well is infinitely better than a good game done poorly

 A Flaw In Street Design May Be Costing Lives - Cheddar Explains - YouTube  
    Safe street design led to shift in driver behavior that led to speeding up, which in turn actually killed more
    Speed is the biggest killers
 The Unseen Inefficiency of Escalator Etiquette - Cheddar Explains - YouTube
    The split in elevator leads to inefficiency and danger of collapse
    Standing on both sides (no walk lane) leads to 30% increase in capacity
 The Problem with Auto-Tune  
    Auto-Tune vs. Pitch Correction―Pitch correction is EVERYWHERE

Why Don't Birds Lay Square Eggs?
    Ovals are not necessarily symmetrical (egg-shaped in Latin), but egg-shaped. Ellipse is symmetrical
    The curve for an egg is stronger than half circle, which is called a catenary
    Eggs shapes are from membrane, not shell (you can dissolve shell and still same shape)
    Odd shape may allow roll in circles rather than straight
    
    
    Universal dimension less variables and fine structure
    Changing a few variables would change the world drastically

 The Bizarre World of Animal Flight | Compilation
    Slideslip―When a plane yaws but still goes in the same direction. This is dangerous because lift decreases
        Vertical tail helps correct sideslip and applies correct force
    Black backs help flying because they absorb heat and radiate to the back to ease air moving over the top
    Spiders use differences in electric fields to balloon up and down
    Bats
        1/5 of all mammal species
        Have different immune systems because they fly
        To fly, mitochondria is in overdrive, have lots of oxidative stress which means lots of DNA damage
        Bats are able to fix DNA damage from overdrive
        However, DNA damage is also occurrence in disease. Bats suppress inflammation

        i.e. baseball (50% of all big hitters are left)
    Cooperative pushes to 100-0 to gain tool-sharing/asset advantage
        i.e. golf players (only 4% are lefty)
