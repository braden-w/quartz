# PLSC 118
Lecture 1 February 2nd, 2021
	Adolf Eichmann↔Fled to Argentina, tried 20 years later in Jerusalem
Lecture 2 February 4th, 2021
	Adolf Eichmann (2-37)
		He admitted that while he was guilty of arranging the transport of millions of Jews to their deaths, he did not feel guilty of the consequences
		Eichmann was kidnapped because of extradition laws in Argentina
		He was placed behind a glass box to prevent assassination
		The death penalty was resurrected
		"I never killed a Jew"
		Lack of evidence: There was only a shred such as "Eichmann proposes shooting"
		Psychologists examined that he was totally normal
		“I will jump into my grave laughing, because the fact that I have the death of five million Jews [or “enemies of the Reich,” as he always claimed to have said]on my conscience gives me extraordinary satisfaction.”
		Eichman distorted the truth, such as saying he asked for a promotion to escape the job of killing others
		"Everyone could see that this man was not a monster, but it was difficult not to suspect he was a clown" (25)
		Eichmann had crises of conscience as the war came to an end (28)
Lecture 3 February 9th, 2021

            Sources of Individual Rights
                Human equality―God gave the world to mankind in common 
                Workmanship―We are miniature gods
                Hermeneutics―We all have equal access to God's word 
                Ownership―Trees and animals are God's waste, so we own them
                God creates no earthly authority―The individual is sovereign 
                rooted in―workmanship
            God created us and therefore we are his property
        God gave the divine will equally to man in common
            Note―until then, kings derived their power from proximity to Adam
            Humans are miniature gods
        What we see as natural law is natural rule over creation
        Hermaneutics↔ 
    Francis Bacon↔Knowledge is power 
    Enlightenment Political Theory
        The idea of free will
            Yes―God is not omnipotent 
            No―Threatens that we have free will
    Early enlightenment
        Scientific certainty
        I think, therefore I am

	Jeremy Bentham, “Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation,” Chs. 1-3, 7 P
		A useful extremist of classical utilitarianism
		The principle of utility
		Vain to talk of the interest of the community without understanding interest of individual
		Features
			Comprehensive and deterministic
				comprehensive↓Nothing it cannot explain
					Objection: What if I do things for religious motivation? You follow religious motivation by pleasure
				deterministic↔Predicts everything
			Naturalistic→We are bound to the principle of utility by "the natural constitution of the human frame". Physical source of pain is the fundamental drive for our behavior, and physical pain and pleasure drives u
			Egoistic, but not subjectivist

		Bentham's radical ideas↔He advocated individual and economic freedom, the separation of church and state, freedom of expression, equal rights for women, the right to divorce, and the decriminalising of homosexual acts. [My note: he lived from 1747-1832, well before most of these views were common.] He called for the abolition of slavery, the abolition of the death penalty, and the abolition of physical punishment, including that of children. He has also become known in recent years as an early advocate of animal rights.

Lecture 5 February 23rd, 2021
	John Stuart Mill
		On Liberty, Ch. 1-2
			On the limiting of powers
				The struggle between Liberty and Authority is the most conspicuous feature in the portions of history with which we are earliest familiar, particularly in that of Greece, Rome, and England. But in old times this contest was between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and the government. By liberty, was meant protection against the tyranny of the political rulers. The rulers were conceived (except in some of the popular governments of Greece) as in a necessarily antagonistic position to the people whom they ruled. They consisted of a governing One, or a governing tribe or caste, who derived their authority from inheritance or conquest, who, at all events, did not hold it at the pleasure of the governed, and whose supremacy men did not venture, perhaps did not desire, to contest, whatever precautions might be taken against its oppressive exercise. Their power was regarded as necessary, but also as highly dangerous; as a weapon which they would attempt to use against their subjects, no less than against external enemies. To prevent the weaker members of the community from being preyed upon by innumerable vultures, it was needful that there should be an animal of prey stronger than the rest, commissioned to keep them down. But as the king of the vultures would be no less bent upon preying on the flock than any of the minor harpies, it was indispensable to be in a perpetual attitude of defence against his beak and claws. The aim, therefore, of patriots, was to set limits to the power which the ruler should be suffered to exercise over the community; and this limitation was what they meant by liberty. It was attempted in two ways. First, by obtaining a recognition of certain immunities, called political liberties or rights, which it was to be regarded as a breach of duty in the ruler to infringe, and which if he did infringe, specific resistance, or general rebellion, was held to be justifiable. A second, and generally a later expedient, was the establishment of constitutional checks; by which the consent of the community, or of a body of some sort, supposed to represent its interests, was made a necessary condition to some of the more important acts of the governing power. To the first of these modes of limitation, the ruling power, in most European countries, was compelled, more or less, to submit. It was not so with the second; and to attain this, or when already in some degree possessed, to attain it more completely, became everywhere the principal object of the lovers of liberty. And so long as mankind were content to combat one enemy by another, and to be ruled by a master, on condition of being guaranteed more or less efficaciously against his tyranny, they did not carry their aspirations beyond this point
			On the liberty of thought and discussion
				The best government has no more title to it than the worst. It is as noxious, or more noxious, when exerted in accordance with public opinion, than when in or opposition to it. If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind

		The materialistic conception of history↔In every society in history, it is organized in a certain way. That society works for a certain time and moves history forward because it works (a mode of production). But this society "contains the seeds for its own destruction"
		Marx was not against freedom. This was not freedom vs. equality

Shapiro notes that it may be better to say "the free development of the all is the condition for the free development of each"
	Master slave dialectic
		The master relegates the slave to object
		The master still depends on the recognition of an equal for his mastery for fulfillment
		But because the slave is an object, the recognition is nill
		Therefore, the slave and master are slaves to each other and are mutually codependent
	The stakes
		We give up freedom as we become more specialized cogs in division of labor
		We must reclaim these cogs of labor

Lecture 8 March 4th, 2021
	http://mofopo.com/reading/Marx_Capital.pdf
		Commodities and exploitation
			Under capitalism, everything becomes a commodity
			People traditionally buy commodities in order to use them, but capitalists buy commodities to sell them for a profit
			Capitalists are able to make a profit is that they only need to pay workers their value (how much it takes to keep them functional), but the workers produce more than that amount in a day. Thus, the workers are exploited
			The capitalists are able to do this because they have more power, and control the means of production. Furthermore, the workers' character is negatively affected by the system. They don't own the products of their labor, and the repetitive work they have to do makes them little more than machines
		Use-value vs. exchange-value
			Use value↔the utility derived
			Exchange value↔long run pric
			Exchange-value is rooted in how much labor-power went into them.
		Constant vs. variable capital
			Variable capital↔Wages
			Constant capital↔Everything else that a capitalist spends money on
		SNLT↔Socially necessary labor time. The time needed to complete a task
		Class in itself vs. class for itself
			Class in itself↔Objectively defined, social group whose members share the same relationship to the means of production, like factory workers
			Class for itself↔Subjectively defined, group who pursues interests
			You are in the working class if you cannot survive unless you sell your capacity to work to someone else
				Even if you have a retirement plan, you are still working class if dependent on working
		Relative & Absolute Surplus Value & Rate of Exploitation
			Exploitation
				Necessary vs. surplus labor time

                Marx responds that as workers get more conscious, they care more about the share of profits they are getting (rather than total work hours)
                This will lead the transformation from Class in itself  to Class for itself
                Marx describes Capitalism the most productive system, as really good at encouraging innovation to increase profits (innovate or die)
                However, there are flaws that will surface over time and eventually lead to its downfall
                Capitalist system is ultimately unstable, because it cannot endlessly sustain profits
            5 Part Theory of Crisis
                Money↔Liquidity crisis (hoarding) because everything is about money
                Declining rate of profit↔As people competed to lower costs, margin of profit shrinks. This was a common concern among contemporaries
                Monopolies and decline of competition↔People will form monopolies

            Revolution
                From each according to his ability to from each according to his labor
                There will be so much abundance from capitalism, that we can go to need
                Capitalism must precede socialism which precedes capitalism, because it must perform its role to create abundance

        Communism is the end of history, there is no end after that
Marx Discussion Section March 4th, 2021
	My question: As Professor Shapiro mentioned in lecture, Marx can often be characterized as idealistic. How is this present in his language and concepts from the Manifesto of the Communist Party? Is this undermining, enhancing, or in fact an essential part of achieving Marx's rhetorical purposes? And does this undercurrent contradict his ideas such as the materialistic conception of history, which argues that society is driven not by ideals, but material conditions? Why do we remember the idealistic Marx rather than nuances of capitalist systems?
	What about performative revolution
	Ten Hours Bill
	In the Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels reference the ten hours' bill in England as a bourgeois appeal to the proletariat. However, rather than addressing how these appeals might erode working class solidarity or how that erosion might be addressed, they assume the appeals will only strengthen the working class and quickly move on. Why didn't Marx and Engels address this potential appeasement-oppression cycle further?
		Would you not want reform to galvanize a revolution?
		Is this an evolution from a Class in itself vs. class for itself ?
	It relies on exploitation
Lecture 9 March 11th, 2021
	Why not just say Marx was a bad economist?
		Like saying Newton was a bad physicist
		External impact: The main historical competitor with utilitarianism and social contract theory
		Despite weaknesses, it was an enduring intuition about power
	The failures of Marx
		All historical predictions were wrong; false positives and false negatives
			Never been a communist revolution in advanced capitalist system, only pre-capitalist or agrarian ones
		Teleological view of history, that history has a direction is misguided
		Cannot transcend scarcity (assumed that capitalism would produce endless wealth)
		Welfare state
			Did not forsee the welfare state coming up
		Comparisons
			Marx encouraged workers to not compare themselves to other workers, but the capitalists who oversaw them
			He's right that people create comparisons, but they don't create the global comparisons like Sanders and Marx suppose; they create comparisons to their peers
	Superabundance
		Wants vs. Needs
			Needs
				Oxygen, food, shelter
				But what about respect, or protection?
	Other failures of consideration
		The government can protect and serve as the proletariet. Can ward off liquidity crisis of the 5 Part Theory of Crisis
	Videos about gaps between rich and poor
		Distribution with rich and poor, even talking about making the rich be poorer
Discussion Section March 11th, 2021 Marx's shortcomings
	Marx argues that the dictatorship of proletariat → to a society of no state
	Soviet Union focused too much on state than superabundance
	Bao: I think although its hard to envision a stateless society now that doesn’t necessarily eschew the possibility of one developing way beyond our lifetimes (assuming human society persists that long)
	Will: Like Professor Shapiro said, a teleological view of history is potentially erroneous in itself because it is a massive empirical assumption to think that history marches in some direction towards some "finality"
	It’s a bit ironic that the only way to 100% disprove Marx’s idea and say that such a society or revolution is impossible, is in fact to adopt the teleological view of history or resort to some really broad generalization
Lecture 10 March 16th, 2021 Examination of the Micro

    --------------------- Portal ---------------------
        Second Semester
    Roemer: Should Marxists be interested in exploitation?
        4 interests in exploitation theory
            the accumulation theory: exploitation of workers explains profits and accumulation under capitalism; it is the secret of capitalist expansion.
            the domination theory: exploitation is intimately linked to the domination of workers by capitalists, especially at the point of production, and domination is an evil.
            the alienation theory: exploitation is a measure of the degree to which people are alienated under capitalism. The root of alienation is the separation of one’s labor from oneself. If one’s labor is put into goods which are produced for exchange (not for use by oneself or one’s community), that constitutes alienation. Exploitation occurs because some people alienate more labor than others. It is differential alienation.
            the inequality theory: exploitation is a measure and consequence of the underlying inequality in the ownership of the means of production, an inequality which is unjustified.
    The hidden moral assumptions behind workmanship
        Marx's idea is a secularized version of self-ownership, that we own what we produce
        The corn theory of value↔To produce anything requires corn. But we wouldn't say that corn owns everything
            object↔Commodities and humans are different
        Horse in the mineshaft—exploited, or not?
            Marx—the difference between animals and humans is humans must work and this produces value, whereas animals exists and human labor creates value. Everything that is of value is created by humans
        Native American, the earth owns us rather than we own the earth—we are not central agency as we suppose
    Joan Robinson↔The misery of being exploited by capitalists is nothing compared to the misery of not being exploited at all

Lecture 11 March 18th, 2021 Leviathan and Government
	Locke's Second Treatise on Civil Government
		People exchange natural rights into society with other people, to enjoy protection, etc.
		People have right to dissolve their government
		Government exists to serve the people
	Hobbes' Leviathan
		Law of Nature↔General rules for human self-preservation, condemn acts destructive to humanlife
			rule 1↔One ought to seek peace
			rule 2→Divest ourselves from certain rights (such as the right to kill others) to satisfy the first rule
				Moral obligation
			additional rules→All follow pattern, build upon each other, generally based off the The Golden Rule, Stealing an Umbrella
			Laws of nature are not mandates of gov authority, but from natural reason
			The natural lust of humans for power always threatens the safety of this contract, so they shall create a Common-wealth, Leviathan
		Common-wealth, Leviathan
			Law of nature is terrible
				Mechanical appetites and aversions, which we escape through combining forces
			Escape nature and provide peace for people
			sovereign↔person or group of people responsible for defense
			Two ways to establish
				Acquisition (force)
				Institution (agreement)
					How natural man raises himself out of the state of nature
			The Leviathan is an intervention, and a monster
			One of the first political theories in English rather than Latin, to increase engagement
			Not about what people agree to, but what rational people should agree to if thinking clearly
		Hobbes does not believe that the social contract is between the ruler and the people. It is among the people to submit to the ruler
			The people submit to any authority, because the alternative is the state of nature, which is lawlessness
			Any state of nature is far worse than any amount or type of government
		But there are limits
			People are not obliged to die for the sovereign
			You don't have to be bound if the state no longer protects you
		Locke
			Locke agrees that state of nature
				State of nature is not necessarily defined by chaos, but autonomy
			Consent is real, an actual agreement rather than a feature of rationality
			Believed in common property, yet supported the enclosure movement—probably because of productivity associated with enclosure; if everything was open we would just eat until exhausted resources
			Lockean defense of welfare state
				Everyone has an indefeasible right to at least as much as they could have produced for themselves
			Defense of commonwealth
				Everyone has a right to at least what they could have produced for themselves
			Back to workmanship
				We own the commonwealth because we make it
				Unlike Hobbes, for Locke the contract does not extinguish the right to resist, short of death
			Consent
				Express consent↔Irrevocable, fully dedicated
				Tacit consent↔You have freedom to go out
			We must use democracy and majority rule
			Limitations on obedience to state
				We subordinate ourselves to majority rule rather than a state itself
				Depends on trust relationship that can be dissolved when it is violated
					You cannot force a child to do anything because they never consented
			The right to resist
				You believe the ruler has violated the terms of agreement
				You believe the ruler has violated the laws of nature
				Perhaps you should resist as you wait for abuses, as people are infringed upon
				The right to resist is high risk and high stakes, is not equivalent to civil disobedience
					It's all or nothing, get the whole government

Discussion Section March 18th, 2021
	Catherine
		Feminist critique↔If you create value through helping your husband, you create value!
		Marx acknowledges that people have different abilities to contribute labor value, but this seems problematic
	The impetus for creating contracts or the leviathan is self-preservation
	I’m reading Moby Dick right now, and the Leviathan is this divine immensity that we both fear and desperately rely on
Hobbes: If you put in labor, its yours
Midterm Review March 19th, 2021
	Bentham
		Workmanship ideal—based off the fact that God gives us the ability to lay claim to the Earth
			Justified on consequentialist framework—we do work to maximize pleasure and minimize suffering
		No Natural Rights
			We don't have natural rights
			All rights should just maximize utility and physiological well-being
			Free speech doesn't help anyone on a physiological level, so we shouldn't do it
		Greatest Happiness Principle
		Diminishing marginal utility
		We have to distribute to absolute equality because of marginal utility
		Practical and absolute equality
		The government must spread out to absolute equality to maximize well-being
		The government does not have a capacity to contribute, but to distribute
		There is an objective measurement
	Mill
		Harm principle—Only do actions that don't harm others
			The government cannot force individuals to do things that cause farm
			Inherently conservative, bias towards status quo
		Disagreement on unified objective measurement for Bentham
		There are different types of pleasures, and lexical superiority
			Chocolate bars and freedom
		Richer view of freedom—positive and negative liberty
		Rights-utility synthesis
			How do we get from rights to maximizing utility?
		Freedom of speech should be allowed because it enables a marketplace of ideas
			Explains how the harm principle leads to us maximize utility
	Locke
	Marx
	Pareto
		No method for comparing interpersonal utility
		No science of morality
		No scientific basis for making redistribution
Lecture 12 March 23rd, 2021
	John Rawls
		Unlikely figure in two ways
			Political Philosophy is Dead (Weaknesses)
				Utilitarian was stuck between subjective and objective
				Marxism was vague, terrible in practice
				Social contract, "natural law" is so vague
			Political philosophy as practiced was a backwater in philosophy
		Yet Rawls was able to
			Singlehandedly revived first order theorizing about the fundamentals of political association
			Became the dominant figure in philosophy in the English-speaking world during his lifetime
	Jefferson believed that the earth belongs to the living, sunset clause of 19 years
	Challenges for Classical Social Contract Theory and their answers
		Nobody agrees on natural law → Answered by Kantian ethics
		There never was a social contract → A hypothetical contract from John Rawls
	Immanual Kant
		Hypothetical Imperative↔"If …, then …"
		Categorical Imperative↔Universal law, regardless of context
			If everyone followed it, it would mean that the world would not fall into chaos
			Does not necessarily support welfare

	John Rawl's Main Contributions
		Moral arbitrariness (instead of workmanship)
			Nobody deserves the social position into which he or she is born
			Moral luck, some people are more lucky? Nature and nurture affects our agency
			A very non agent-centric view
		Resources (instead of welfare)
			Focus on resources instead of welfarism
			In response to subjective util vs. objective util
				Classical utilitarianism doesn't take the differences between people seriously
				Neoclassical utilitarianism takes the differences between people to an extreme
				Subjective is too weak
				Objective is too strong
				"What's good for people is not good for other people"
				Let's change the subject
					People have different conceptions of welfare, what's good for them
					Focus on the resources that you want as a conception of what makes a good life for you
		Deontological (instead of Teleological)
			deontological→Determine what good is first, then distribute rights
			teleological↔Utilitarianism is a teleological view. We will distribute rights in society without reference to the good
Lecture 13 March 25th, 2021
	Rawl's Theory of judgement
		Less arrogant justification of Hobbes
			Hobbes thought that his argument was equivalent to geometric proof and must be right
				If you read my book and disagree, you're just not clearly understanding the ruth
		His key method: Reflective equilibrium
			Rawl encouraged reflective thought equilibrium that you would naturally think mine is better
	Veil of ignorance
		Justice is blind
		What you, in reflective equilibrium, conclude that people would choose behind the veil of ignorance

		Universally agreed from every conceivable standpoint
		You cannot know for sure which one you will end up (you could be white or black equally, or male or female, etc.)
		Shorthand for Kantian shorthand
			Universalize because it would be universally agreed from every conceivable standpoint
	Value lexicality of prioritizing goods
	Principles of Justice and Primary Goods

		Liberties
		Opportunities
		Income & Wealth
	Comparing Fundamentalist in United States vs. Nonfundamentalist in Iran
		You must compare the worst of one system with the worst of another, not the best of one with the worst of the other
		According to Rawls, Fundamentalists cannot claim that the US is bad because Iran would suit them better
		You would need to compare how you are in US, vs. a Nonfundamentalist in IRran
	The difference principle (Income & Wealth )
		https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/eAbYP059dXsF0bzkfCpHsvU2-oibmfIbnIuOgz-8xBXcUJ7A0zElNYAL11_OouyAUpsopF2EFK9enn4cNAhU9ankj2NCh2nYXIQEyyCq320O4Wd0LcCWohONs5dun6YD.png
		If you do not know if you are A or B (behind the veil of ignorance), you would still move from x to y because you cannot tell if you are going to be A or B , and the new worse off is still better off than the former better off
   Discussion section March 25th, 2021
	The categorical imperative should be completely divorced from empirical and what can be observed
	Objection to Categorical Imperative
		The way the categorical imperative is derived is from the outcome, which is empirical, even though it claims to ascend past that and be universal
			If we accept the veracity of a statement, it must be absolute. The moment we defy a duty, we are trying to make an exception to ourselves which is not true
			Truth is not equal to simplicity
			How can a person with objective experience and subjective views ever derive an empircal rule?
	John Rawls
		What is justice?
			Justice is the first virtue of a society
				All societies are entitled to a reparation if they are unjust
			Justice is blind
		Against welfare state because it promotes poor mental state of beneficiaries
		Property only democracy
		Difference between utilitarianism↔Distributive justices
		Justice as fairness
Lecture 14March 30th, 2021 Rawl's responses to criticism
	Problems
		Thin theory is thicker than Rawl admits
			Rawl wants a theory that's thin with as few assumptions as possible
			But you can't derive something from nothing. There are a bit of risk (from Harsanyi)
			Chain connection and the Keynesian back door (from Shapiro, Rae)
		Kantian argument is key but fails
			Original position doesn't establish Rawl's theory; it's an expository device
			Example: cake cutting
			The one who cuts the cake should have the smallest slice
			But what if one person is diabetic and the other are children?
		Moral arbitrariness proves too much (Shapiro)
		Moral arbitrariness proves too little (Hurley)
	Students laughing at why nobody incorporated Rawls
		explanation↔Enduring pluralism of values. Even if the most philosophically sound argument, there is still a bias that we have been inculcated
	Rawls's responses to his weaknesses
	John Rawls’ alternative distributive principle, which he calls the Difference Principle, is examined next. The Difference Principle permits diverging from strict equality so long as the inequalities in question would make the least advantaged in society materially better off than they would be under strict equality. Some have thought that neither strict equality nor Rawls’ Difference Principle capture the important moral roles of luck and responsibility. The “Luck Egalitarianism” literature comprises varying attempts to design distributive principles that are appropriately sensitive to considerations of responsibility and luck. Desert-based principles similarly emphasize the moral roles of responsibility and luck but are distinct because they approach these factors through claims about what people deserve because of their work.

Lecture 16 April 6th, 2021 Nozick Part 2
	Marxists who have abandoned the labor theory of value
	nonetheless affirm variants of the workmanship ideal
	Nozick's overall goal
		To establish the superiority of historical or procedure as "rights as side constraints" over "patterned" or "end-state" principles of Justice
		Nozick thinks that unlike Rawls, he is the only real deontologist
	Nozick's example—Chamberlain's deal
		He negotiates a salary plus 25c per home game ticket
		1,000,000 home game spectators, gains $250,000
		Left critique of markets is that we pick the status quo
			If the starting point is unjust, voluntary transactions do not confer legitimacy
			Prostitute who has no other choice but to sell her body is a voluntary transaction but not "legitimate"
		His response—you pick any "just" status quo. They inevitably produce a result different from this status quo
			This critique is a bluff
			Where you start isn't important, because it will always change

    Crossfire (Televised debate)↔The ultimate demonstration of emotivist culture
    
Section April 15th, 2021 Burke
	Burkian approach to reform
		David Bromwich↔Martin Luther King, and other civil rights leaders, are Burkian rather than natural rights advocates
			Are they using inherited tradition properly?
			They are not proposing new ideas, but extensions to the existing system
		This implies that rights have already been established properly . Instead, they just simply haven't been passed down properly
		This is interesting because arguably, there is nothing wrong with the system, or a lack of rights. Instead, the system has just not been extended to the right groups of individual
		If not an easier argument to make, it is at least more palatable
	Whether or not something is a revolution is independent of it being Burkian or not

Final Paper
	Hypothetical vs. Categorical Imperative
	Question 1
		Advantages
			Wisdom, reliance on past (Burke)
			Promotes self-interest of individuals
				Hobbes—you need a social contract to protect you
				Rawls
				Burke—you want knowledge and tradition
				Nozick—the purpose of state is to preserve voluntary transactions. Nozick believes that once government has power monopoly, it will protect people without overextending. You need a lot of gov intervention to maintain only voluntary transactions
				Douglas raye utility drift, once voluntary transaction drifts into oh shit movement. Opinions shift. Think wilt chamberlain. Also against unanimous decision because opinions change
			Government derives its power from consent—Locke
		Hobbes believes the government should be able to have control, to keep people from killing each other
		Hobbes says children are owned by parents and submitting to authority
		Disadvantages of Social Contract
			Oversimplification of consent
			Hard to gov reform (Hobbes, Locke, Nozick)
				To overthrow the government, you need majority
				Even if I don't consent, I can't change it easily (Locke is interestingly resistant to changing government)
			What about repugnant social contracts?
				Bias towards status quo and outlasting generations
					Jefferson believed that the earth belongs to the living, sunset clause of 19 years
				In contrast, Burke was focused on decentering of the individual and respecting
					"Society is indeed a contract… a partnership between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are yet to be born" - Burke Reflections on the Revolution in France
						In contrast to Jefferson believed that the earth belongs to the living, sunset clause of 19 years
					Rights are inherited
						The rights of Englishmen have been inherited over generations
						The rights of man have not been inherited
					Not "what am I entitled to" but "what is expected of me?"
					"A disposition to preserve, and an ability to improve, taken together, would be my standard of a statesman" -Reflections on the Revolution in France
					A government is like a ship at sea, cannot rebuild from scratch
	Question 2
		Locke↔"The act of the majority passes for the act of the whole, and of course determines, as having by the law of nature and reason, the power of the whole" -Second Treatise of Government
			It's possible to interpret his words as realistic
			Przeworski: Majority rule is a "flexing of the muscles", a veiled threat or signaling that minority should align as they will surely lose
		Majority rule is dangerous, fear of tyranny of majority rule Tocqueville
		Madison's: Views on parties and majority rule
			"The latent causes of faction are… sown in the nature of man…so strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts" (Federalist #10)
			Madison sought a society without factions
			The worst faction distibution is the majority faction that tyrannizes

			The minority faction is incentivized to destroy the system or not participate it
			Madison attempts to avoid factionalism
				"a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican government"↔a larger democracy is better because it minimizes the likelihood of majority tyranny. Let's introduce more groups, more cross cutting cleavages. You can make it less probable that a majority of the whole will find a common motive, or to make it more difficult for them to find these similarities
				to increase numerous cross-cutting cleavages which manages the effects of factions decrease the likelihood of tyranny of majority
				Solution
					pluralism
					cross cutting cleavages
					separation of powers
					"Ambition must be made to counteract ambition" (Federalist #51)
			Madison considered themselves to be building a "non tyrannical Republic" and not necessary a democracy
			The people must be able to control the government
				It is very easy to veto, controlling majority
				Supermajority, separation of powers, bicameralism, federalism
				Inefficient to legislate, efficient at maintaining the status quo
		Schumpeter: Democracy is like shopping, or a market
			different from→Multi party systems
			In the democratic method, "individuals acquire the power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people's vote"
			Compete rather than divide up power. They gain temporary control to enact their agenda
			Let the best system win

			Institutionalizes Mill: Argument, not deliberation
			Deliberation is consensus and getting agreement
			Argument is about vying for temporary control, fight for undecided voters
			[[Median Voter Theorem]]
		Habermas's "ideal speech situation"
			Criteria
				Everyone has an equal opportunity to participate
				Everone is free to assert, defend, or question any factual or normative claim
				No one can be coerced into curtailing the rights specified in (1) and (2)
				Everyone is motivated solely by the desire to reach an agreement about the truth of statements and the validity of norms
			It's supposed to be a heuristic or hypothetical rather than practically enacted: What would an ideal speech situation conclude?
			Key, Possibly Dangerous Assumptions
				It's possible for people to agree about fundamentals
				People are motivated to agree about fundamentals
			Deliberation↔We will seek people to converge and all agree. There is a common good, like Rousseau
			Objections
				What if we agree to disagree?
				Deliberation can undermine agreement
					marriage therapy↔We realize we don't want to be together
					gag theory↔We just don't talk about these topics, because that ensures convergence
		Fishkin's alternative
			Deliberative polls
			Random selection
			In depth discussion
			objections→https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/q_IQ21TtM4vro91j9-zg8GKCCUaJJVnyCfpDZDYghC5gQ9raX7rVN3jD707Ypc1z7l_Mc1U2cjyNG5a5ZLa93mojUOZKjOEinnsNzh5Q-uamKqzRw4wbAk1oeeFmRXX_.png
			Deliberative settings
				Some people may appear more confident and skew the vote
				You would have been better off asking the wisdom of the crowd instead of having the supposed "farmer" claiming he knows the answer
		Rousseau's General Will
			General Will vs. Will of All
			General Will↔The shared will of all, subtracting all areas of difference
		Locke on the right to resist
			Interestingly, he is harsh on resistance
		Of the people, by the people, perhaps for the people—they will think it's for the people
		Rawls doesn't specify unanimity or a procedure for deciding
