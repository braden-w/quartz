    Anti-realism―There are no objective truths
    Emotivism―An ethical theory that regards ethical and value judgements as expressions of feeling. Emotion is involved, I am expressing emotional approval or disapproval
        Stevenson―viewed normative ethics as the most important branch of ethics, strong proponent of Emotivism  
    Realism―Facts
    "Resultivism"↔We care about results ultimately 
Discussion 1 February 18th, 2021
    The existence of multiple theorems does not imply there is no truth
        Moral claims have truth value
        The presence of multiple theorems does not imply there is no truth
            String theory vs. loop theory
        There is convergence, progress. This convergence is truth
        Charles Purse
        Math is a language of objective truth
            Different notation of objective truth
            Therefore, philosophy is language of objective truth
            You could say language is the expression of belief, not truth
        Societal values do not affect math, the way you are born does not affect math
            Maybe some people are born less mathematically inclined?
        Ethical language
            Slavery ended only 50 years ago, in light of human existence
        The existence of truth does not imply simplicity
            Newton's laws of mechanics—they thought it was super simple, but it gave rise to something far more complex in relativity and
            
        Counterargument: You cannot assume that something is true until you observe it
            Who cares about the truth. The fact is, is the other side is abusing and assuming that we can believe there exists a truth as a truth when it doesn't exist
            In fact, the aff has a greater burden of proof. It doesn't matter
            Quantum mechanics—we don't know until we observe
                Counterargument to this: There is a truth,

Lecture 3 February 15th, 2021
    Quantitative vs. Qualitative hedonism
        Quantitative hedonism↔Maximize pleasure, and maximize quantity * quality
            Mill's objection↔not all just quantity and intensity
        Qualitative hedonism↔There are certain high qualities of pleasure that are better, which are lexically superior 
    The experience machine
    Reverse experience machine
Discussion 2 February 15th, 2021
    Simulation machine
        Why I am a hedonist: I am either in a simulation or being simulated too. In other words, the status quo I live in is equivalent to an experience machine. I will never find objective truth. Therefore, I might as well be in a simulation or experience machine
            You might think that we do not have knowledge in the experience machine
→We already have no real knowledge in real life anyway
            Privacy argument—suppose it was legal to access someone's microphone at any time. Should that be illegal? Assuming they never find out. They never know, so why does it matter?
→
    Truth is in potential for validation. That is, there is a chance a human stumbles upon it and observes in in the future. If it can be observed, it is true
Lecture 4 February 17th, 2021
    Mill Chapter IV
        The only proof capable of being given that an object is visible, is that people actually see it. The only proof that a sound is audible, is that people hear it: and so of the other sources of our experience. In like manner, I apprehend, the sole evidence it is possible to produce that anything is desirable, is that people do actually desire it
        Desire for virtue
        Even the pursuit of virtue is in fact a pursuit of utility
    Preference theory
        Does not explain why we desire the things we do
    Well-being is a measure of having what you want
        ACTUALLY having what you want
Lecture 5 February 24th, 2021
    Instrumental good
    Instrumentalist stories on behalf of the welfarist
    Utilitarianism
        Consequentialism↔What matters in determining right and wrong is bringing the best results 
            Bold↔Only thing that matters is consequences
            Pluralistic↔Consequences for many instead of few
        Welfarism↔Measuring right and wrong should be the welfare of individual people
            strong welfarism→The only thing that matters is good and bad welfare
            Does not include pluralistic ideas such as distribution
        Equal total welfare, different distributions
            Egalitarians must argue one is better
            Welfarists must argue one is worse
        https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/HpUuLtT-bX3WH8dVj7fnoXOpMoMHYyQRYDn346ERLVsk_VOqdy8gpfJO7jEpF7mcSPRDEdQEVA-v3MMGd-PsahaG7gjkZnDseVlP5mBSnOoCsZkuY60eDQgQAf600Odh.png
Discussion 3
    Equal total welfare, different distributions
        Burden of proof
            You could argue there is a badness, which traditional factors into negative well being
            It's all factored in the total welfare
            Everything has been rooted in the framework that what matters is total well-being. This helps the welfarists but not the egalitarians
                Reallocating causes negation to total well-being
                Marginal utility, a little for poor goes a long way
                ... All factored into equal of welfare
        IQ Distribution
Lecture 6 March 3rd, 2021
    Can we tell what your motives are? Do they matter?
    Counterargument to utilitarianism↔How do we know it's the best result? We should spend an inordinate amount of time calculating
        Heuristic
    Common-sense morality↔The system of moral rules that we use in everyday life to make judgments about the character and actions of other people. And of ourselves, of course.
    Subjective vs. Objective
        Subjective is your personal motive, like I did the objectively right thing for the wrong subjective reason
        Subjective right thing to do↔Give the poison labelled medicine
        Objectivist right thing to do↔Give the medicine labelled poison

        How does justice correlate or not to Utilitarianism
    Introduction to Desert
        Welfares could support Desert  because it incentivizes those
Lecture 8 March 15th, 2021
    Mill does not create a deeper foundation for utilitarianism, and so it is a fundamental foundational principle
    Mill offers proof for utilitarianism, but qualifies that this type of proof is not necessarily intuitive

    Critics of Mill says that he is making a enormous fallacy
        Visible means can be seen, therefore x is visible
        Audible means can be seen, therefore x is audible
        Desirable means can be desired, therefore x is desirable
        But Mill is saying that desirable means worthy of desire
    They don't understand Mill's reasoning
        I have to be able to hear or see it to be persuaded
        Therefore,

    Doing vs. letting harm
        I am skeptical of duality, whereas it is a gradation
        50%
        Direct causal chain of events
        Common sense
    What if we zoom out, and instead of examining causing harm at the event level, what about the entire level
        We can draw the causal chain all the way to say that you have caused everything
        What if we instead accepted that we all cause harm, and instead just sum them up?
        Integral calculus of causality, the theoretical minimum amount of causality
    Objection↔Is it a category distinction, or gradation?
        Heap of rice problem↔Many rice is a heap, but what is the number that makes a heap?
        If it is a gradation, it suffers from the Heap of rice problem
Section March 22nd, 2021
    Rules
        Ideal rules↔What is a rule?
        Hiearchy of rules
            If you perform a rule above in the hierarchy, you are justified
            At the base,
    Fundamental rules can be super complex and are not equal to their written form
        The written rule is not equal to the fundamental rule. That is why there must be interpretation, and would be the only basis for having a judge
    Collapse argument
        “Don’t steal”. If not absolute, becomes rule “don’t steal except when … or … or …” is better than compliance with the simpler “don’t steal”. This point generalizes. In other words, for every situation where compliance with some rule would not produce the greatest expected good, rule-consequentialism seems driven to favor instead compliance with some amended rule that does not miss out on producing the greatest expected good in the case at hand. But if rule-consequentialism operates this way, then in practice it will end up requiring the very same acts that act-consequentialism requires.

    Armchair philosophy
        Psychology has nothing to benefit philosophy
    If we're all rational, how do we still end up with different results on a math exam?
Section March 29th, 2021
    Car to the hospital example
        Adding justifications to it?
    What defines a rationality?
        What we only need, there is no standard for what is rationality
        Instead, it is what we think is rational
        The only requirement is that it is universally generalizable
        Kant believed in the power of rational humans
    Inclinations are not a grounds for ULF's because they create hypothetical rather than universal desires
    We are attempting to align our subjective wills and irrational beings with the objective rationality
Lecture 12
    The rugged individualist prefers to work alone whereas someone insists on helping him (Kantian)
    What about "you have to go to Yorkside?"
        Ununiversalizable maxim
        It's not good for everyone to do this
    There are numerous formulations of the Categorical Imperative
Lecture 13
    What if we say only Shelly Kagans are allowed to kill?
    The Golden Rule
    Is it universalized for myself, or everyone else
    The Formula of Humanity
        Contains the command that we ought never to treat persons merely as means
        Kantians believe we should treat people as an ends, rather than a means (like a slave or pen)
    Who we consider rational or humans, and who we include in our moral rules
        Superman technically would be included, even though he isn't human
        Babies should technically not be included, because they can't think
Section
    Maxims
    Utilitarians vs Deontologists
        Utilitarians have easier time saying what's good and what's bad, but struggle with rules
        Deontologists have harder time saying what's good and what's bad, but can easily handle rules
    How Hare approaches
        Imagine I can or will live the lives of myself and everyone i interact with. What would I want to do?
        He wants hardcore utilitarianism, because I'll live all the lives anyway
        Wouldn't the ULF, if applied to everyone, not arrive to util?
        Similar to the Veil of ignorance

    Determinism and free wills
        incompatibilists→Determinism and free will are incompatible
        compatibilists→Determinism and free will are compatible
    Determism vs. fatalism
        Determinism→Everything has a cause
        Fatalism↔Nothing you do matters
            Fatalism is stupid (choosing a salad example)
                "Even if you picked the pizza, you would have eaten the salad"  is stupid
Lecture 15 April 12th, 2021
    Repugnant suggestion: What if there is no cause? There's only randomness to everything
    Quantum mechanics↔At the core of the universe is not deterministic, but probabilistic
        Incompatibilist
        Denies determinism, but does it prove free will?
            What defines free will? What is an account for it?
    Reason sensitivity account
        We are a product of our desires, and our desires are kinda malleable
        We have reasons for everything, even if not moral
    Free will vs. Divine foresight
        If God knows everything, how do we have free will?

Office Hours April 12th, 2021
    It's fine to treat people as a means, as long as you also treat them as an ends. It is impermissible to treat them only as a means
    Take them as a rational being
    ULF vs. Formula of Humanity: One of them must arrive to it's okay to lie, and the other does not
    Does the ULF really remove lying? We can still achieve success in spite of lying
    Cheating example: I lied, but I showed complete respect to you as an autonomous being the entire time?
        You can't destroy one's autonomy/capacity unless you hypnotize them
            There's a difference between destroying autonomy and not respecting it
                That's why Kant believed suicide was immoral—it destroys autonomy
                But Kant believed that there's more to respecting autonomy than destroying it
        Respect their ends—what if their ends was to have a meaningful relationship
        To have a good life does not rely on complete information—do we need to universalize not lying?
    Intransitivity
        If we define "larger than" as "heavier or taller than", then we can easily arrive to an A is larger than B, B is larger than C, but C is larger than A
        When we use multiple criteria, it's possible that some are more important when comparing two and some are less when comparing others
        "John is the father of Sam, Sam is the father of Bill, but John is not the father of Bill!"

Section April 12th, 2021
    Causality
        Interesting—I brought up the quantum example earlier before to say there are somethings we cannot know for certain
            But determinism does not imply that we need to know all causes to accept that everything has a cause
        Quantum - observing causes it to be heads
        What if the act of observing in fact causes the state, heads or tails? Rather than the other way around?
            The state is not heads or tails until we observe it
            Therefore, we preserve causality of determinism. The quantum example still demonstrates causality
    Parallel universes
    If you accept that everything has a cause, then do you have to accept that everything was caused from the beginning?
    Incompatibilist vs. compatibilist and the downstream tree
        Clay Thames' position→ Everything behind me exerts cause of me because I'm in their causal tree, but I have a causal tree which I control everything after 
            I have free will over everything downstream, and am influenced by everything upstream to me
        Agent centric
        Or you're just an interface that is taking in other causes and returning pre-conditioned actions

    Autonomy and
    kant↔You are implicitly committing yourself to free will by believing it when you're making the action
    numinal world→The world as it is, free of misguided interpretation we layer on top of the world
    phenomenal world→What we interpret about
Lecture 17 April 19th, 2021
    Is–ought problem
    Hume critique of Rationalism
        Our motivations are rooted in 1. desire and 2. belief
            Motivation is created when desire + belief
        Our moral beliefs can guide our actions
    Why reasonists can't challenge desires and the subjectivity of desires—response to "You should have certain desires"
        When our beliefs don't match the world, we change our beliefs
        When our desires don't match the world, we change the world
Lecture 18 April 21st, 2021 Emotivism
    When I say "Murder is wrong", I am expressing desire more than belief
        I am expressing my emotions
    He's a normative utilitarian
        You won't have morality until you have the relevant desires
    Serl, deriving is from ought
Lecture 19 April 26th, 2021
    Hobbes and the state of nature
Section
    Maybe you should choose the objective heuristic,  straight line from A to B instead of the subjective other pass. It's like guessing a number on a math problem. The answer is usually 0 or 1, so it's better to guess that than any other number, even if that's closer to the right answer
    Are all laws based off morals? Laws organically arising from the state of nature
        It's possible
    Natural progress and certain ideas tend towards equilibrium
        We are naturally randomly proceeding through different states, and some tend to stay in equilibrium better than others
    Evolution applies to ideas and frameworks
        Left handedness is constantly observed at 10%, as a balance between two conflicting forwards
        Meme theory—ideas propogate and reproduce using humans as their hosts, and the fittest ideas survive
        What if the fact that we have utilitarian and kantianism is part of evolution? Perfect equilibrium is 30% util, 70% kantianism, etc.
    Does Kantianism have a universalizeable outcome for the Prisoner's Dilemma?
Lecture 20 April 28th, 2021
    Veil of ignorance vs. Kantian contractarians
        Veil of ignorance is self-interested, but random distribution. The bargainers are not motivated by fairness, but self-interest
        Kantian considers the lives of everyone, and then is motivated by fairness
            To Kantians, everyone has to have a voice or avote
            Kantians agree on fiarness but disagree on the mechanism
        Ignorance vs. omniscience, but not really
            Veil of ignorance is considering what a single person would vote for
            Kantian considers what everyone votes for
        Evolutionary skepticism philosophers
            All of our ideas are
            Evolution built us to believe not necessarily what is true, but what is
            The selfish gene
            Self-serving
            Everything is about reproduction, so why does science and everything

    Multiple criteria of comparison
    Objection to conception of infinity
        Let's slap a number on everything to keep transitivity
        Objections to infinity and Deena
        Objection to pairwise or comparing everything at once
        Why not average or mean? Even if the total sums were both “equal” infinity, why not assign the “average” or “mean” as a tiebreaker
        Lexically below on sum
        Median
        Infinity corrupts many of our arithmetic operations
        Why not use statistics—if I were to pick randomly from this distribution and then iterate infinitely, what will I get?
            This is numeric
            It is similar to the veil of ignorance, how fitting!
            Veil of ignorance, of course I want Pareto improvement
            This sidesteps the need for certainty
        M2 is still better than M1, even if not already in M1

    Defense: It pays to be moral
        1. Hobbes has already proven it?
        2. Stick approach: There is punishment for this
