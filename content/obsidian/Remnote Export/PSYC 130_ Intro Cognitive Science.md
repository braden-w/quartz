    Why not cognitive scienceS
        Well think about individuating sciences
            Is there a science of mind, aerodynamics, and cryptography?→No
        Natural alignment of our interests
            Short past but a long history
            William James→Wrote the first books of psychology, the Principles of Psychology, cool dude
            Instinct Blindness→The deep-seated blindness from our own intuitions end up making us ignore essentials
                Confucius quote about the commonplace
                Perception is like a reflex
                Examples
                    Black square with white background, but black square
                    Squares on the checkerboard are the same color
                        "I hope you fucking appreciated that"
            Curing Instinct Blindness
                in computational modeling→When you have to implement a process, you rapidly find out how difficult it is (like Minsky or the compression problem)
                in neuropsychology→When healthy, the brain operates too seamlessly to recognize what's happening, but brain damage tears different processes apart
        Intrinsic Scientific Reasons
    Marr's 3 Levels
        Marr's 3 Levels
            Computational→What is the problem being solved?
            Algorithmic→What are the steps used to solve it?
            Implementation→How are those steps implemented in underlying hardware (biological or otherwise)?
        Is each level critical? The different responses of philosophers
            Jerry Fodor→"Who's to say we're a biological science?" More into Computational  and Algorithmic  
            Paul Churchland→Neuroscience is the way. More Implementation  
        All levels are critical!
            You can't get away with only computation→Many aspects of cognition can be explained only by nature of algorithm (e.g. afterimages)
            You can't get away with only implementation→Capturing generalizations (e.g. Microsoft Word, Comparative psychology, Computer vision)
    How does the colored black and white image work?
        Overlapping humps of photoreceptors for different colors (to enable balance of differentiation and recognition between colors)
        Short medium long (RGB)
        When light hits your eyes, it's transduced into photoreceptors

 -- Avoided infinite recursion --     
    A general rule in science...is to seek an appropriate level of description.
        The answer must be through multiple levels. You can't go through just one
        Consider the circuitry of the Comodore 64. Looking just into the circuitry will show you nothing on cognition
        You'll never be able to recognize patterns in circuitry, since the way different brains work are very different

    Why all these disciplines?↓
        Natural alignment of our interests
        Shortcuts to the truth
        Intrinsic scientific reasons
    --------------------- Portal ---------------------
 -- Avoided infinite recursion --     The right level of abstraction
        The problem with the Connectome example→Seeing the wirings of the brains won't give us understanding
            We've had the full connectome of other organisms (e.g. C. Elegans for about 35 years)
            Complete brain circuit diagram has been mapped out, but has not given us understanding
    Structure from Motion
        The globe with a bunch of horizontal oscillating orbs looks like it's spinning counterclockwise
        Structure from Motion Theorem→It's impossible to see structure unless you see 3 views of at least 4 (non0coplanar points)
    Cognitive Architecture
        name inspired from→Computer architecture
        inspiration→Break down mind into fundamental operations
        Ideas that comes from computer science
            Basic memory
            Fundamental operations
            Brute constraints
        Examples
            Synaesthesia→Mixing colors and numbers
                People with Synaesthesia  can see a bunch of 2's in a field of 5's instantly
                It's an automatic reflex and is innate in them
                It's an actual difference in Cognitive Architecture
                If we color the numbers differently, we can see it stand out
            Gender differences→Real, balanced, "significant", nuanced differences between men and women
                examples
                    men are better at 3D rotations
                    women are better at pointing at general direction of different foods at farmers' market
                        the error rate was negatively correlated to caloric value→people remembered high-calorie foods (like olive oil) way better than lower calorie ones (like lettuce) 
            Different speeds of time→Time goes at different rates
                example→the dot that flashes for equal lengths, but the period in which it grows seems to slow down time
            People have different clock speeds
            Balint's syndrome→They can only see one thing at a time
                They can't tell the difference in length between 2 lines | |
                They can tell the difference in lengths of two sides of a quadrilateral though
            Strong vs. weak equivalence
                Deep Blue and Kasparov
                    Kasparov | If the computer makes the same move that I make but for completely different reasons, has it still made an intelligent move?
                        Related to theGettier Case Example
                Error analysis→Do both systems make the same mistakes in the same situations?
                Complexity Analysis→Do both systems take equally long to process same set of inputs

Lecture 4 September 14th, 2021
    Nature vs. Nurture
        It is the  Worse-than-Useless  Question
        the crucial point→Innate structure is designed to learn!
            Like language acquisition. You innately expect there to be  nouns and verbs  , in the same way that The bees innately have a notion of the sun, and that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, and know the path of the sun in the sky
        Bees shake their butts
            They know where the sun is in the sky, even when the sun is occluded
            Scientists controlled when bees were able to see the sun
            The bees innately have a notion of the sun, and that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, and know the path of the sun in the sky
        Identical twins reared together vs apart
        Heritability→The proportion of phenotypical variance that you can attribute to genetic variance
            It is a measure of variance
            When we refer to Heritability  of height, it doesn't measure height in the first place, but the difference of height in the first place
            Does not necessarily imply that there is a gene for it
            What is the heritability of having a nose?→Approximately 0
            What is the heritability of wearing earrings?→Not zero
                If it was 100% among women, then within women, there is no heritability (it is like having a nose). Within men and women, there is a heritability of 1 (we can directly attribute to traits)
            What is the heritability of wearing earrings circa 1950 in the US?→Even higher than What is the heritability of wearing earrings?
            T or F: Higher heritability ⇒ more likely to be inherited→False
            T or F: Higher heritability ⇒ less modifiable→False
        The Bell Curve
            Controversial, the logic
                Across white kids, intelligence is highly heritably
                Across black kids, intelligence is highly heritable
                Black kids have lower test scores
                Murray then attributes the result to lower IQ among black people
            Best rebuke is from the The two flower populations example
    Conservativism Example
        Counter to what we expect, conservatism is Heritability
        MZT (Monozygotic Twins)
        DZT (Dizygotic Twins)
        MZT (Monozygotic Twins)  and DZT (Dizygotic Twins)  are close in levels of conservatism until around 25 years old, then huge disparities in conservatism afterwards
        You stay the same as you grow up
        It's after you go to school that you become what you grow into what youHeritability  to be in conservatism
Heritability cannot be contrasted across populations:
    The two flower populations example
        1 is given lots of good soil and sunlight
        height varies from result
        conclusion→You can have height (or another property)  highly Heritability among two populations, but have drastic diferent outcomes across them due to environment
    The plant example for Heritability
        Takeaways→Heritability is only comparable within populations and not across populations

    Exploring Nature
        Identical twins reared apart
        Precocious infant cognition
            Newborn babies spend more time looking/engaging with :) faces than scrambled faces, suggesting that there is an  innate  inborn desire for scrambled faces
        Poverty of the stimulus arguments
            There's not enough stimulus to explain the preference of regular faces over scrambled faces
            It's possible that adding stimulus desensitizes us to them rather than makes us more sensitive to them
            Preferential Looking→Show monkeys several pictures at once, and see which one they spend more time looking at (alarm clocks vs. other humans)
            Visual Paired-Comparisons→Show monkeys several pictures
            Deprived monkey experiment
                Deprived monkeys were not exposed to human faces as they were being fed, others were
                Deprived monkeys could spot differences among humans better
                conclusion→Exposure leads us to prune away things that we get used to
            Regarding language: we are born able to discern all sounds, but they are pruned away
            Learning plays the role of pruning away abilities of human nature, rather than adding them
            The cataract curing blindness for the first time study, asking questions to people once they see for the first time
                T or F: Do they fall for the same visual illusions (i.e. which line is longer)→T
                conclusion→Whatever's responsible for visual illusions are innate to human nature/genetic endowment
            The universal assumption of light source of top
                this is wired into many animals
                examples
                    The 2 by 3 matrix of dimples and pop outs
                    Flipping pictures of asteroid craters gives completely different results because we still think the light source is on the top
                    Countershading→Most animals are darker on the top and white on the bottom. This is because of the The universal assumption of light source of top . 
        Neurodevelopment disorders
        Cultural Universality
    Visual cliff example
    Innateness
        Why innateness?
            Learning takes time
            Uniformity
        Common misconceptions about Innateness
            "If it's not preset at birth, it must be learned from environment"→Not true, consider puberty
            "Innate cognitive mechanisms have no need for input from environment"→Not true, innate senses need to be trained (consider bees)
    Pieces of Mind (Modularity - More like Magic  of the mind)
        Ubiquity of specialization (you usually can be really good at one thing, but not both)
            At the molecular level
                Hemoglobin transports oxygen

            Anatomical Level
                Heart pumps blood
                Liver detoxifies poisons
            The question→Does this work on the behavioral level?
    Modularity - More like Magic
        The shepherd's paradox
            Two benches look completely different even though the parallelogram on the topics is the same
            This is an example of Foreshortening and Modularity - More like Magic
            You know that it's shade of gray, but you cannot penetrate the Modularity - More like Magic  of the thought process because it's taken all at once across multiple processes
        Informational encapsulation↓The inside cannot see out. Processing internal to the module can't access external information
            covers→mental reflexes
        Lack of access to 'interlevels'→The outside cannot see in. Processing outside the module can't access the intermediate output
            explains→Instinct Blindness 
        symptoms or characterizations  of 
            Fast processing→You can't even recognize how you're processing (think of faces, how can you tell these things?)
                Why?
                    encapsulation→Circumscribed database
                    mandatoriness→No need to decide if or when to respond, it's just instant 
                The frame problem
            Characteristic breakdown
                example→man with stroke who speaks perfect English but completely incoherent. Information stored in chunks or modules 
                Does cognitive modularity —imply→ neural modularity?
            Domain Specificity↓What do you plan on doing in the first place
                Domain Specificity  is not the same as Encapsulation
        Encapsulation→what do you have access to?
            Domain is more releated to algorithimic level while Encapsulation is more related to more computational
        Face recognition/face percep and ntion
            You can recognize people without eyes but with eyebrows better than vice versa
            Morph↔The human face slowly morphs into a really inhuman version
                We have hidden subtle things that allow us to perceive faces
            Prosopagnosics↔There are people who can understand faces but cannot recognize them
            On the other hand, there are others who can recognize people just fine, but can't recognize people
            Superrecognizers↔There are some people who are super good at recognizing faces | Scholl's wife

    Why is the sky blue?
        light hits molecules in the sky, and then are scattered, but this happens to multiple types light. It happens most to blue light
        polarization→The scatter of light in two directions
        After light hits a molecule, it encounters polarization  and then turns from a single line to a sinelike wave, which can be observed

    The accidental car crash vs. intentional murder
        This exercise illustrates an age-old legal principle, encapsulated in the phrase “actus non facit reum nisimens sit rea”, meaning, ‘an act is not guilty unless the mind is guilty’.
    Mind Body Problem | nobody knows lmao
    5 Steps of Evolution
        Reproductive Math | geometric growing population
        Crunch time | finite resources and has population that is too large
        Nonrandomness | who survives is not a lottery
        Inheritance | any bias advantage would be amplified over time
            If a mutant produces just 11% more offspring than its rivals, it can represent its representation in the population from .1% to 99.9% in just over 4000 generations
    A pessimistic estimate of the time required for an eye to evolve
        Rate of adaptation is more related to need rather than difficulty of development
        The layers of the eye was simulated and then left to evolve in conditions
        Eyes kept on evolving
        The entire sequence took only about 400,000 generations
        Vertebrate eyes evolved some 40-60 times independently from each other

            Examples
            Limitations
        Using microscope
            first, we need to make the brain flat , so we suspend it in preservant and slice it into thin slices
            Patient H.M.

        does not measure brain activity, but blood flow in the brain 
        How it works
            Spin
            Magnetic part→In a magnetic field, the axis of spinning protons align themselves based on field
            RF Pulses
            Blood flow→See oxygen depletion
                Increased activity→Sudden oxygen depletion→Over replenished a few seconds later
            Blood and magnetism 
            Measurement
                When you use a brain, increased blood flow
                    More oxygen and hemogloben
                    Less susceptibility to magnetic field
                    Slower proton precession back to normal
                    Longer precession period
                    Stronger field signal!
