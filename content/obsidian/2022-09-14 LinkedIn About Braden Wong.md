# [[2022-09-14]] [[LinkedIn]] About [[Braden Wong]]
I'm an Ethics, Politics, and Economics major from Yale University who loves building things and is drawn to tech and policy. Currently dabbled in a lot of software engineering, where I like to rapidly prototype and test new ideas, but I also really enjoy creative writing, Legos, and philosophical conversations!
