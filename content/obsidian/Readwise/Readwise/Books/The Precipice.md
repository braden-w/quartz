## Highlights
- we have become powerful without becoming commensurately wise. ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07V9GHKYP&location=509))
- Both wars kill billions of humans; but the second war kills humanity. Both wars destroy our present; but the second war destroys our future. ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07V9GHKYP&location=702))
- There would be no people to suffer or grieve. There would be no badness at those future times, so how could the destruction be bad? And if the existence of humanity was somehow essential to judgments of right and wrong, good and bad, then perhaps such concepts would fail to apply at all in the stillness that followed. But I now see that this is no better than the old argument by the philosopher Epicurus that your death cannot be bad for you, since you are not there to experience it. What this neglects is that if I step out into the traffic and die, my life as a whole will be shorter and thereby worse: not by having more that is bad, but by containing less of everything that makes life good. That is why I shouldn’t do it. While Epicurus’s argument may provide consolation in times of grief or fear, it is not fit to be a guide for action, and no one treats it so. Imagine a government using it as the basis for our policies on safety or healthcare—or for our laws on murder. ([Location 769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07V9GHKYP&location=769))
- In the last chapter we saw how humanity’s remarkable success has relied on our capacity for intergenerational cooperation: inheriting from our parents, making some small improvements of our own, and passing it all down to our children. Without this cooperation we would have no houses or farms, we would have no traditions of dance or song, no writing, no nations.34 ([Location 792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07V9GHKYP&location=792))
- one doesn’t repay one’s parents. One passes it on. ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07V9GHKYP&location=817))
- Because the arrow of time makes it so much easier to help people who come after you than people who come before, the best way of understanding the partnership of the generations may be asymmetrical, with duties all flowing forwards in time—paying it forwards. On this view, our duties to future generations may thus be grounded in the work our ancestors did for us when we were future generations. ([Location 818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07V9GHKYP&location=818))
- we are alone, our survival and our actions might take on a cosmic significance. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07V9GHKYP&location=864))
- If we are the only moral agents that will ever arise in our universe—the only beings capable of making choices on the grounds of what is right and wrong—then responsibility for the history of the universe is entirely on us. This is the only chance ever to shape the universe toward what is right, what is just, what is best for all. If we fail, then the potential not just of humanity, but of all moral action, will have been irrevocably squandered. ([Location 867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07V9GHKYP&location=867))
- each nation is tempted to free-ride on the efforts of others, and some of the work that would benefit us all won’t get done. The same effect that causes this undersupply of protection causes an oversupply of risk. Since only 1 percent of the damages of existential catastrophe are borne by the people of the United Kingdom, their government is incentivized to neglect the downsides of risk-inducing policies by this same factor of 100. ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07V9GHKYP&location=957))
- Behavioral psychology has identified two more reasons why we neglect existential risk, rooted in the heuristics and biases we use as shortcuts for making decisions in a complex world.62 The first of these is the availability heuristic. ([Location 981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07V9GHKYP&location=981))
- As a society, we are good at acute compassion for those in peril—for the victims of a disaster we can see in the news reports. We may not always act, but we certainly feel it. We sit up, our hearts in our throats: fearing for their safety, mourning for their loss. ([Location 990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07V9GHKYP&location=990))
- We also suffer from a bias known as scope neglect. ([Location 993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07V9GHKYP&location=993))
- existential risk is very new. So there hasn’t yet been time for us to incorporate it into our civic and moral traditions. But the signs are good that this could change. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07V9GHKYP&location=1000))
- A fragment of an asteroid or comet that enters our atmosphere, burning with the heat of atmospheric friction, is called a meteor. A piece that survives, having fallen all the way to the Earth’s surface, is known as a meteorite. ([Location 1073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07V9GHKYP&location=1073))
- 25 A key problem is that methods for deflecting asteroids away from Earth also make it possible to deflect asteroids toward Earth. This could occur by accident (e.g., while capturing asteroids for mining), or intentionally (e.g., in a war, or in a deliberate attempt to end civilization). Such a self-inflicted asteroid impact is extremely unlikely, yet may still be the bigger risk.26 After all, the entire probability of collision from one-kilometer or greater asteroids currently stands at one in 120,000 this century—we would require extreme confidence to say that the additional risk due to human interference was smaller than that. ([Location 1154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07V9GHKYP&location=1154))
- Experts on supervolcanic eruptions do not typically suggest that there is a direct threat of human extinction. While there was some early evidence that the Toba eruption may have nearly destroyed humanity 74,000 years ago, newer evidence has made this look increasingly unlikely.32 Since Toba was the largest known eruption in the last 2 million years and we now have thousands of times the population spread over a much greater part of the Earth, we should assume extinction to be a very unlikely consequence.33 The effects may be roughly comparable to those of the one-to ten-kilometer asteroids, with major global crop failures lasting for years on end. Since the world only has about six months of food reserves, there is a possibility that billions of people could starve and that civilization could suffer a global collapse. I think that even if civilization did collapse, it would be very likely to recover. But if it could not, that would constitute an existential catastrophe.
