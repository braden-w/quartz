## Highlights
- The Biggest Value Ad, Is Lanes Keeping
  Summary:
  I missed having the system so much. I it's so much more tiring to drive without it. In atons o vehicles, to day waymo does not add value to people's lives. It's a more expensive flowo, slower uber. Maybe some day it'll be this big cliff where it adds.

  Speaker 2
  value. Ad, ah, but also that that's all it is, and that
  Speaker 1
  not only, i find it a huge value. Ad, i drove down when we moved to san diego, i drove down in a enterprise renta car, and i missed it. I missed having the system so much. I it's so much more tiring to drive without it. It's, it is, that lane centring. That's the key feature. And in a way, it's the only feature that actually adds value to people's lives. In atons o vehicles, to day waymo does not add value to people's lives. It's a more expensive flowo, slower uber. Maybe some day it'll be this big cliff where it adds. I don't usually mean this fast. An, i haven't talked totha,
  Speaker 3
  this is good. I haven't. I have, intuitively, but i think we're making it explicit now. I i actually believe a that really good lane keeping, i's a reason to buy a car. Well, be a reason to buy a car, and is a huge value. Ad, i've never, until we just started talking about it, haven't really quite realized it that i've felt with elon's chase of level four is
  Speaker 2
  not the correct chase
  Speaker 3
  it was, cause
  Speaker 4
  you should just say, tesla has the best,
  Speaker 2
  as if from a tessa prorspective, say, tesla has the best lane keeping. ([Time 0:33:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9f966b88-7f59-4ac8-99ee-c7251c642dcb))
- The Trolley Problem
  Summary:
  The most popular question is a, the trolley problem. We don't know how yet to detect the ethical dilemmast. So we're going to disengage and leave that decision to the human. You're such a troll? No, but the trolleyproblem deserves to be trolled. E ea, rigt, that's a beautiful answer, actually.

  Speaker 2
  So, something that's from a hacking perspective, this always comes up, especially with folks. Well, first, the most popular question is a, the
  Speaker 3
  trolley problem, right? So
  Speaker 2
  that's notsof serious a problem. There is some ethical questions. I think that they arise a,
  Speaker 3
  maybe
  Speaker 1
  you wod do youthink there's any ethical, serious ethical questions? Ev, we have a solution to the trolley problem. Come a. I well, so thers are actually an alert and our code ethical dilemma detected. It's not triggered yet. We don't, we don't know how yet to detect the ethical dilemmast. We're a level two system. So we're going to disengage and leave that decision to the human. You're
  Speaker 4
  such a troll? No, but the trolley problem deserves to be trolled. E ea, rigt, that's a beautiful answer, actually. I know i
  Speaker 1
  gave it to someone as like, sometimes people ask, like you asked about the trolley pro you can have a kind of discussion about it, like, boon, you get someone who's like, really, like, earnest about it. Because it's the kind of thing were, if you ask a bunch of people in an office whether we should use a sequel stack or no sequel stack, if they're not that technical, they have no opinion. But if you ask them what color they want to paint the office, everyone has an opinion on that. And
  Speaker 4
  that's why the trolley problem is a,
  Speaker 2
  i mean, that's a beautiful answer. Yet we're able to detect the problem, and we're
  Speaker 3
  able to pass it on to the humanwo, i've never, never heard any more say it. Ndit a such a nice escape. Wert oka,
  Speaker 4
  by a proud level, too. ([Time 1:45:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e6ed23dd-7c38-4442-92ca-5aee4d189fa8))
- How Hard is it Do You Think to Hack in a Thomas Vehicle?

  Speaker 2
  ai in general is a hacking.
  Speaker 3
  So
  Speaker 2
  how hard is it do you think to hack in a thomas vehicle, either through physical excess or through the more sort of popular nowd these adversarial examples on the censors,

  the adversarial ([Time 1:45:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e037efff-be6f-4f32-9697-463ed1147a2a))
- If you need to use GPS, you're doing something wrong
  Summary:
  Vta v relies on both parties getting communication, right? This is not even a safety a security is like, a special case of safety. If your car is relying on g p s in order to have a safe driving policy, you're doing something wrong if you're relying. And this is why v to v is such ate rable idea. Ndit a such a nice escape. Wert oka, by a proud level, too. A proud level to i love it.

  how hard is it do you think to hack in a thomas vehicle, either through physical excess or through the more sort of popular nowd these adversarial examples on the censors,
  Speaker 4
  the adversarial examples. One, you want
  Speaker 1
  to see some adversarial examples that affect humans, right? Oh, well, there used to be a stop sign here, but i put a black bag over the stop sign, and then people ran it. Adversaria, right? Like, like, like, there's tons of human adversarial examples too. Om, question in general about, like, security. If you saw, i something, something just came out to day. And, like, there are always such hype headlines about, like, how navigateon auto pilot was fooled by a g p s spoof to take an exit. At least that's all they could do, was take an exit. If your car is relying on g p s in order to have a safe driving policy, you're doing something wrong if you're relying. And this is why v to v is such ate rable idea. Vta v now relies on both parties getting communication, right? This is not even, so, i think of a safety a security is like, a special case of safety.
