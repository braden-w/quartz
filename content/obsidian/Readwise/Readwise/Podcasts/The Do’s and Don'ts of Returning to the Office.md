## Highlights
- Speaker 5: I'd have to, you know, at the end of the day or the next day drive it into the office. 
  Speaker 0: Well the 80s version sounds terrible except I want the boss who does home delivery. 
  Speaker 5: Yeah I was impressed that she said she managed to get a boss. My boss did one drop. 
  Speaker 0: Some leaders have long resisted the idea of letting people do some of their work remotely. But back in 2010 Nick, let a landmark experiment showing that when people were randomly assigned to work entirely from home, they were 13% more productive. They took fewer breaks and shorter breaks. They were also half as likely to quit. Fast forward to March 2020 Covid hit and the whole world became a research lab for Nick and his colleagues. They started collecting a lot of data ([Time 0:02:55](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a65fc43f707348d6cd47fc))
    - Note: The case for working at home: huge productivity gains in a 2010 study
- Speaker 5: basically spend a lot more time shaving, putting on makeup. You know, getting getting kind of polished when they go to work. So you're saving your employees 70 minutes a day. It turns out roughly 30 of those 17 minutes. People say they work more for the job. So if you're an employer each day your employer works from home, they're putting in about 30 more minutes. 
  Speaker 0: I love your finding about the time saved around not commuting right? I remember reading this and thinking, whoa, wait a minute, economists have discovered a way to get an extra hour in your day. Just work from home. Right. 
  Speaker 5: Good 
  Speaker 0: for organizations and for humans nick are you saying that Hybrid is the future? 
  Speaker 5: Hybrid? Yeah. Hybrid is definitely the future. The future is starting now we're in this return to the office moment over summer ([Time 0:04:13](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a65fc43f707348d6cd4807))
    - Note: Hybrid work is the future
- Speaker 5: testing the email from your tech. Exactly. And they tracked these folks for six months and what did they find? The 
  Speaker 0: people who work from home two days a week were every bit as effective. They performed just as well and they were just as likely to get promoted. 
  Speaker 5: So there's no difference but quit rates were down 35% amongst the work from home employees measures of job satisfaction, burnout, work life balance are all massively better and the firm said, look, this is incredibly positive, so much so it is going to roll it out to the whole company 
  Speaker 0: In March 2022 Trip.com rolled out, working from home two days a week for the entire company 
  Speaker 5: and I know from talking to folks in china, there are other tech companies now thinking of ([Time 0:06:36](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a65fc43f707348d6cd4811))
    - Note: Chinese company that had an RCT: half worked 2 days a week in person, half worked all days a week in person. Huge productivity gains!
- Speaker 5: is this paradox of choice versus coordination. So they say, you know my employees, they really want to choose which days they want to work from home. The problem is hybrid to work. You do need to coordinate on the days of the week you're in and then the days of the week you're at home and once you get that fixed up and people accept it and you move ahead, then I think hybrid works well. 
  Speaker 0: If hybrid means everyone can work from home whenever they want, proximity bias is a problem, managers reward the people they interact with in person. The coordinated approach, having everyone in the office on the same days can solve the fairness problem that might leave some groups at a disadvantage. 
  Speaker 5: So imagine your apple and you've agreed to work from home ([Time 0:11:12](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a65fc43f707348d6cd4820))
    - Note: If you have hybrid, ideally set collective schedule so that it is fair and people don’t lose out (but launch an exeriment or A/B testing)
- Speaker 3: and started to see that black and brown professionals disproportionately prefer remote or hybrid work. In fact To the tune of about 97%. And why is that? People say that they no longer have to take the psychological commute in order to feel included. They no longer have to deal with microaggressions that comes in many forms and the code switching that people have to do and women feel the same way. And if we use all of the tools that are available to us, I think we're going to have more diverse and more inclusive places. 
  Speaker 0: That's such an important shift. And I think what you're surfacing here is that we can't just say, ([Time 0:28:34](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a65fd03f707348d6cd4a86))
    - Note: Marginalized groups prefer hybrid approach (upwards of 97%)
