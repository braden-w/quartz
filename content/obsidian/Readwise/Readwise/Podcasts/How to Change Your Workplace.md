## Highlights
- Don't Change their Values. Appeal Them
  Summary:
  The number one mistake of leading change is that we try to change things with information. When leaders paint a vivid, emotionally evocative picture of their visions, people are more likely to commit to them. John ter says most people think that the way change happens is three steps, analyzed, think change. The way it works is, see, feel change. People see something that makes them feel something, motivated, surprised, appalled and that sparks the change.

  That's like the qouince essential organizational change story, because it doesn't look like we expectit to look, right? We think that once he has the spread sheet,
  Speaker 7
  once he has the quotaquote, business case, everything
  Speaker 3
  just going to fall in line. Well, it doesn't usually work that way. The number one mistake of leading change is that we try to change things with information. But if we just shovel enough information, o people, poof, we're going to change. But the people had to have an emotional response to open them up to change. When
  Speaker 1
  leaders paint a vivid, emotionally evocative picture of their visions, people are more likely to commit to them. They can see the future, and they're all inspired by the same image, which has been a theme for a long time in research on change.
  Speaker 3
  John ter says most people think that the way change happens is three steps, analyzed, think change. He says, no, no, no. The way it works is, see, feel change. People see something that makes them feel something, motivated, surprised, appalled, and that sparks the change. People saw the gloves on the table that made them feel appalled, and that led to the change. I
  Speaker 1
  love that story. It's a timely indictment of the mistake i make over and over again in my own life wetches. Let me just show you more data. Why are you not coming on board?
  Speaker 3
  Exactly. You can't just recycle analysis you did to figure out the right way to go as the factor that motivates people to go with you. You're trying to deliver a dose of reality. You're trying to find the emotional reason to change. Once
  Speaker 1
  you've painted a vivid picture of the need for change, move to step too. Don't try to change people's values. Appeal to the values they already hold.
  Speaker 6
  Which brings
  Speaker 1
  us to texas, and one of my all time favorite change efforts.
  Speaker 3
  Back in the eighties, texas was having a really bad problem with litter. The state was spending 25 million bucks a year cleaning up roadside litters, getting worse every year. ([Time 0:07:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/49475032-0396-41a2-99e4-0f87cd897a42))
- How Texas Shrunk Roadside Litter
  Summary:
  In the eighties, texas was having a really bad problem with litter. The state was spending 25 million bucks a year cleaning up roadside litters. So what do you do? You create a campaign called don't mess with texas. In five years, roadside litter declines 75 %.

  Which brings
  Speaker 1
  us to texas, and one of my all time favorite change efforts.
  Speaker 3
  Back in the eighties, texas was having a really bad problem with litter. The state was spending 25 million bucks a year cleaning up roadside litters, getting worse every year. They
  Speaker 1
  start studying the problem, they realize that the type of person who tends to litter is between 18 and 35, drives a pickup truck, enjoys country music and sports, and might be a little anti authority. So
  Speaker 3
  in other words, what they had found as that, do you want to reduce roadside litter, you've got to reach someone that fits this profile, which they lovingly call baba. You have to reach baba. Ha, ha. Ha hah. Well, how do you get baba to change? The
  Speaker 1
  researchers rack their brains on how to make baba change. A bigger fine won't help. Baba's anti authority telling him to stop. We'll just en urge him to litter more. You can't tell me what to do. So what do you do? You create a campaign called don't mess with texas.
  Speaker 3
  The gist was that if you're a good texan, if you love your state, you will not defile your state with your litter. And in this campaign, they had these famous texan men, two tall jones, mike scott nolan, ryan of ander holyfield, lyle loveat willi nelson, these classic texan men roll models, were making this case in commercials. Ind
  Speaker 1
  the campaign works. These liter s, or litter bubbas, would be damned if they went against their raw mottos. In
  Speaker 3
  five years, roadside litter declines 75 %. 75 %. Think of all the individual instances of wrappers kept in pickup trucks and beer cans thrown in the back instead of on the street for that to be possible. ([Time 0:08:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8afc24b5-a891-4bab-b069-c27814311a0b))
- Don't Change Boss Values. Appeal to them as if they were always there
  Summary:
  The campaign highlighted the littering violated values that were already part of their identity as sextons. Make it easy for people to find small winds. Appeal to their identities as subject matter experts with knowledge to share, hoping your manager will give hybrid work a try. Remind him of his values of attracting and retaining top town.

  Make it easy for people to find small winds. If
  Speaker 3
  you're trying to change things with an organization and you're not in a position of formal authority, your strategy isto to figure out how to require less motivation. But person one time said their strategy had always been to make it easy for the boss to say yes, reducing the amount of motivation you need. And that's a concept and switch we call shrinking the change. One that resignates with me, because i'm kind of a messy person, you
  Speaker 1
  know, tha feeling your whole house is a mess, you'll never be able to straighten it up.

  But what if you shrink the change? So
  Speaker 3
  this woman called the fly lady, who has an on line house cleaning web site, she has this trick she calls the five minute room rescue. So you take a kitchen timer, you wind it up to five minutes, and then you rush into the dirtiest room and your house, do whatever you can do in that five minutes. Tink, you can quit with a clear conscience. But no, of course, you don't quit. Because even in five minutes you can make a surprising amount of progress. And three hours later, you kind of snap back to consciousness having just cleaned the entire place. That's shrinking the change. These

- Appeal to Existing Values
  Summary:
  modern class rooms project is a different way of teaching. Instead of lecturing students all at once, teachers create their own instructional vidios for lessons. Students can then access the vidios from anywhere, any time to work through the less os at their own pace. Since teachers aren't busy lecturing, they're free to support students one on one. This was the biggest revelation of my teaching career, because it freed me up to be truly responsive to every individual human in my class room.

  The modern class rooms project is a different way of teaching. Instead of lecturing students all at once from the front of the classroom, teachers create their own instructional vidios for lessons. Students can then access the vidios from anywhere, any time to work through the less os at their own pace. And since teachers aren't busy lecturing, they're free to support students one on one.
  Speaker 2
  This was the biggest revelation of my teaching career, because it freed me up to be truly responsive to every individual human in my class room.
  Speaker 1
  Emily wanted to bring the model to other class rooms, but it was a major change to the way things had always been done in schools, and there was plenty of resistance. Teachers
  Speaker 5
  were sceptical. Parents were sceptical.
  Speaker 1
  Even her own students were sceptical. To convince them, emily applied the three steps. First, she created an emotional image of why change had to happen. Teachers were exhausted. Teacher
  Speaker 2
  burn out and teacher attricion was huge for me and my messaging to them coming out of cove it, teachers were tired. If we don't change something, we're all going to quit. We won't be healthy humans if something doesn't shift. It
  Speaker 1
  wasn't just the teachers who needed change. Students needed it desperately too. They were zoning out in some classes and missing others. Altogether, i
  Speaker 2
  probably had about half of the students actually show up live. You know, the learning gaps that occurred in the last two and years are really significant. What we need is a model that will help us fill in those gaps and really prevent them from getting larger. So that was kind of how i framed it. Second,
  Speaker 1
  emily got students and parents on board by appealing to their existing values, their sense of pride and educational excellence and their desire for more personalized instruction.
  Speaker 2
  Yes, i thought through very carefully what our students and our parents would want. I think this is a tool that our students need, that our parents need, because, you know, they don't want their students to get behind.

- When the Ship Is Sinking, You Need to Plug the Hole
  Summary:
  The most important decision we make as leaders is who do we put in positions of power? A mistake i made for too many years was putting too much emphasis on expertis and experience when recruiting somebody. In being clear about our leadership expectations, they had to be non negotiable. And instead of trying to change everyone's values, bert worked to close the gap between their existing values and their daily behaviors. When the ship is sinking, you need to plug the holes, get the ship back in shape and get going.

  done. That was too big of aceng i
  Speaker 1
  love this point, that the people who are effectively running the organization aren't always the ones with the scales or the motivan to change it. And
  Speaker 2
  it's also the people who are running the opsition may not have the capacity to re invent it. Maybe adam, the most important decision we make as leaders is who do we put in positions of power? A mistake i made for too many years was putting too much emphasis on expertis and experience when recruiting somebody. Over time, i spent more and more emphasis on, who is this person? In being clear about our leadership expectations, they had to be non negotiable. I told the the officers had best by f you don't agree with these principles, that's alk except, oh, you cannot work here. And
  Speaker 1
  instead of trying to change everyone's values, bert worked to close the gap between their existing values and their daily behaviors. When
  Speaker 2
  the ship is sinking, you need to plug the holes, get the ship back in shape and get going. Interemt team ad wanted to rewrite the values. I said, now we're going to stop that, because i read the values. They're fine. What we need to do is change our behaviors as supposed to rewriting the values. Oftentimes
  Speaker 1
  people are threatened by a leader coming in and telling them, wait, what we always was important? Our heart and soul are d and a, that's not you any more. So say good bye to that. And
  Speaker 5
  i
  Speaker 1
  think part of what you're saying you did is you allowed people to stay attached to who they were and what was important to them. That's
  Speaker 2
  such an important pontraiht, so i took the time to understand the d an a of the company, xpect it and love it, honour it and make it more current. And so that way we didn't need to be divided between the old gard and the new garrd. We just need to get back into the game and refresh it o for the new age. Sure

  A young boy had a dinozor toy as a gift from santa claus. Unfortunately, the dinozo was quite sick. The head was dismantled from the rest of the body. A typical sales associate would have exchanged the toy for a new one. That's not what the little boy wanted. He wanted a cure for the dinosaur. And on that day, in that best by store, his two associates, who understood what was going on, took the dinosaur and like a good doctor, they studied to perform a surgical procedure on the dinosar.

  There
  Speaker 2
  was a store in florida where a young boy had a dinozor toy as a gift from santa claus. Unfortunately, the dinozo was quite sick. The head was dismantled from the rest of the body.
  Speaker 1
  A typical sales associate would have exchanged the toy for a new one. That's
  Speaker 2
  not what the little boy wanted. He wanted a cure for the dinosaur. And on that day, in that best by store, his two associates, who understood what was going on, they took the dinosaur, and like a good doctor, they studied to perform a surgical procedure on the dinosar, of course, replaced, but gave back to the little boy a cure dinosaur. And you can imagine the joy of the little boyd his mother. And so the question is, do you think there was a standard
  Speaker 6
  operating procedure at besbar? Wait a minute. Wait a minute, mary, are you saying there wasn't a trax squad? There
  Speaker 2
  was not a tirak squad? They found it in their hearts to create that oy wwere creating an environment where people could be themselves and could do what they felt was the right thing to do. This was magical. This was human magic. And the transformation was done not by changing out every one of the company, but by allowing everyone to become the best, biggest, most beautiful themselves. Too
  Speaker 1
  many people try to force change when they should be looking for ways to unleash it. Your workplace is full of people with ideas for improvement, and all they're missing is the authority to try them. Change nt have to be about walking away from something good. It can be about growing and expanding into something better. ([Time 0:34:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/72e27167-b1a2-4a14-9c55-2d444952e868))
