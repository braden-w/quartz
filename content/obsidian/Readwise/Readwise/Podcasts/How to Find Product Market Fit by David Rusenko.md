## Highlights
- Minimal Remarkable Product
  Summary:
  Step one, have a great idea. Step two talks customers. Step three, something happens there. And step four, profit. So what does this process look like? Ad, i'll try break it down into very literal steps about exactly what you should be doing.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  does. They say, we'm going to kind of hack it to do that. Anyway, when you find people hacking your product to do something it wasn't intended to do, pay attention to that and double down on that um. And then often what you initiate create will seem to fit into an existing market, but with less functionality, right? So it's the same thing with the iphone. It it's the same thing with web. Oftentimes it doesn't have three g it doesn't have aps, it doesn't have any of these things initially. But what it does do is it enables a whole new market, a whole set of new entrances to come and use your product. And so the success of the iphone wasn't that it successfully competed against smart phones. It sure looked like a smart phone, but it wasn't competing against any smart phones that were out there. Because what happened is, there was maybe, at that point in time, i was a heavy palm trio user, there was maybe a couple million smart phone users in the united states. What the iphone did is made everyone a smart phone user. And so there is all send a whole bunch of new entrance. And in overtime, it also canibalized the existing smart phone market. Ah, so a lot of times people may sort of mistake you for incumbents when you're crning entirely new market. So the next is on building a remarkable product. So what does this process look like? Ad, i'lltry break it down into very literal steps about exactly what you should be doing. Ah, so everyone knows this, right? Step one, have a great idea. Step two talks customers. Step three, something happens there. And step four, profit. Right? Everyone knows his. But what is step three, right? Cause that's where everyone's plodding around in the desert, like, trying to figure out what the hell to do, and nothing's working. So let's talk about step three. So
  Speaker 2
  step three is literally this list of things. So
  Speaker 1
  you talk to customers and develop a market thesis. Try to understand exactly what their pain point is. What's that job they're trying to get done, and how can you help them get it done faster or better? Um, this is really important, listen to their problems, not their solutions.

- Do You Overthink Your Strategy?
  Summary:
  Make sure you're talking to a target customer. Test slution with customers. Don't overthink it. Just getting in there and building and launching something, trying it out and iterating is the most important thing you can do. Do all your home work,. looking at the market, looking at the strategy. It can be the perfect strategy, but no one's going to use your product.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  work. It's because when you out sorce a project, that's one shot. Wel if it's going to take you 20 to 30 shots, now got to work. You need to build a team that can very, very quickly, iterate, rinse and repeat a ok, this is another important point. Test slution with customers. So here are your here are your a. There's some helpful tools here, but the most important rules are, number one, make sure you're talking to a target customer. Ah, so it's not helpful to just talk to any one. Make sure it's the one youre targeting. But make sure that you are superflexible on changing your view on who those target customers are. So when you talk to someone and it seems like, hey, this isn't my target customer, but then i'll there's a whole bunch of em showing up and they're hacking and doing really interesting things with your product, you should pay attention to that in a potential change who your target customer is. Number two, don't overthink it. I think this is a problem lot smart people can have. You obviously y want to rely on data. You want to rely on market research. You get really, really into the weeds and the strategy, and you super overthink everything. Am, don't overthink it. Anecdotas, ok. Am, just getting in there and building and launching something, trying it out and iterating is the most important thing you can do. Doing all your home work, all your research. You know, looking at the market, looking at the strategy. It can be the perfect strategy. Ca, be the perfect strategy, but no one's going to use your product. Ahm, so don't don't overthink it. A, here are base three tools. I think these are probably the only three tat you need. A number one, customer interviews. You probly need about five to ten of these a.

- Launch When Your Product Is Better Than What's Out There
  Summary:
  We had the practice of doing this before we launch thing. And all sone people saw it as a sign a form. A, which is incredible. This is the kind of thing we would have never discovered if we hadn't done u. So i'ld recommend doing it all the time for everything you launch. You don't need that many sessions. Ok, here's another question comes up. When should we launch? Ah, there's this whole a minimum viable product,. The product that is the least you can build to be remarkable. All right, so this is a quote from pabohit says, launch when your product is better than what's out there. But i
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So we
  Speaker 2
  a, so
  Speaker 1
  we so we put the sign aform and it said, signed up here in probably like hundred point font, and then it had two fields. It said, ema, address, password, and we're about to launch it. But we had the practice of doing this before we launch thing. And so i got a couple o people down. They were just friends, and i sent em for nte lap tilli, said, sign up andd these pretect people and am. And about forty five seconds later thet turned sa, i don't, i don't know how to sign up. How do you not know how to sign up? It says sign up here in a hundred point font, like, what the hell's going ona? Another side point, people don't read a so so and i sil why don't you know how to sign up? Its right here. Ad said, oh, that makes so much sense. Well, i just didn't look at that cause i assumed emal pastwor as a login form, obviously. Ah, so wasn't a sign a form as a login form. So we added a gratuitous field that just says your name so that we could have three fields. And all sone people saw it as a sign a form. A, which is incredible. A. This is the kind of thing we would have never discovered if we hadn't done u. So i'ld recommend doing it all the time for everything you launch. You don't need that many sessions. Ok, here's another question comes up. When should we launch? Ah, there's this whole a minimum viable product, which i think is a lot of the thinking is, is is good. It's new sinse, we launched. But i don't really like the word viable, because it's kind of insinuatingthatyo're going to put, like, the, like, just the least crappy thing you can out there. Im i much prefer a, the worda remarkable. So minimum remarkable product, the product that is the least you can build to be remarkable. All right, so this is a quote from pabohit says, launch when your product is better than what's out there. ([Time 0:25:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2f2a7f6d-9457-4f06-9d06-36fbf1d917c8))
- Tracking Return Usage Is Really Important
  Summary:
  If you track that metric more than anything else, that is the indicator that things are working. I remember handing out wheebly logans to all my friends and family, and none of them came back. And if they're not coming back, then no one's going to come back. So i think number one, tracking return usage is realy important. Number two, track n p s. The percentage of people who answer nine or ten, those are a promoters. If it's above 50, you're doing pretty well. Renewals cohort based. Um, so churn is just looking at number subscribers lost, divided by a toa act of subscribers in any given period.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  basy. Just look at people who
  Speaker 1
  sign up or come to your sight or you're apt, and look at the number of people who come back within a day, with three days, within seven days, within 30 days, right? If you track that metric more than anything else, that is the indicator that things are working. 'm in the early stages. I remember handing out wheebly logans to all my friends and family, and none of them came back. And those are the people who like you the most, and those are the people who would really want you to be successful. And if they're not coming back, then no one's going to come back. Ah. And so i think number one, tracking return usage is realy important. Number two, track n p s. There's all kinds of tools to do this now. Or n p s. Some people say forty. I think about 50. It's above 50, then you'd probably cheap prot market fit m n p s. If you ever answerd that question, would you recommend this proter service to a friend? That's n p s. It's one question. You rank from zero to ten. A basically the percentage of people who answer nine or ten, those are a promoters. The percentage of people who answer zero to six, those are detractors. And people who answer seven or eight are thrown out. So in the early days a weble had an m p s of 80 %. That was basically 88 % of people answered nine or ten, eight % of people answered zero to six. And by matthew's right, 12 % of people answered seven or eight. So ba, takea 88 % minus eight % equals 80. If it's above 50, you're doing pretty well. M the way thismetric is built, it can get negative, and that's probably where it will start. A, and the number three, paying customer renewal rate. S when you have paying customers, look at their renewal rates. Um, a quick side bar, i don't like the churn metric for looking at this. A lot of people use that because it's easier to calculate. Ah, but basically, churn is not cohort base. Renewals cohort based. Um, so churn is just looking at number subscribers lost, divided by a toa act of subscribers in any given period. I don't like that, because if you're a denominator, m is changing like less at you're growing really rally quickly. Your denominar is changing fast. In eununumerator, the numerators based on last year's denominator. Am, and
  Speaker 2
  so basically it's, it's, it could be deceptive
  Speaker 1
  asto what your actual turn is, but your renewal rates are great, because tht's looking for the number, the percentage of people who are eligible to renew, and what percentage of those people act renewed. And that's cohort base. So i like renewal rates a lot better. All right, a next a metrick that aren't included. ([Time 0:29:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/545811ef-9499-4a49-aaee-e7969fc139a4))
- How Does It Feel When You Get Product Market Fit?
  Summary:
  You'll know when you achieved it when your customers are beating a path to your door. When you don't have it, everything feels hard. It feels like you're pushing this huge rock up a mountain. They're too nice to tell you no, but they're not really coming back. And that's cohort base. So i like renewal rates a lot better.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Am, and
  Speaker 2
  so basically it's, it's, it could be deceptive
  Speaker 1
  asto what your actual turn is, but your renewal rates are great, because tht's looking for the number, the percentage of people who are eligible to renew, and what percentage of those people act renewed. And that's cohort base. So i like renewal rates a lot better. All right, a next a metrick that aren't included. So number one metrick that is not included is sign ups. This is something that was not very well understood when we got started. I would not pay that much attention to sign ups. I would pay a lot of attention to active users. U if you have good returning usage, and sign ups translates the active users pretty well. If you have bad returning usage, then sign up basically like completely drops off, and you have very little active users. In fact, that number may even be shrinking, even when your stiamps are growing, if people aren't returning. A number two, conversion rate. If if you're thinking of building a sas business, conversion rates, they all start low. They build over time. I wouldn't pay a lot of attention to conversion rate in the beginning. I'd pay attention to some of the other metrics. A, i think it's the last point. Just how does it feel when you get product market fit? Ah, you'll know when you achieved it when your customers are beating a path to your door. A, when you don't have it, everything feels hard. It feels like you're pushing this huge rock up a mountain. You're a pushing your customers towards the solution. They're too nice to tell you no, but they're not really coming back. They're not really using it. When you have it, the whole world is beating a path to your door. Everyone wants to use it. Ah, pressis writing about it. Everything feels easy, and every decision you make feels like you're a genius, because they all go, well, ah, you know, t spoiler alert, it's somewhere in between. Ah, it turns out that, you know, as you're scaling your business overtime, you'll discover, ah, you're maybe a little less smart than you thought you were. Ah, but, but, but, that comes later. A but, i think this is what it feels like. So if you're not feeling that, you know, sort of, customers pulling you in a direction world, you know, beating a path to your door, then you probably don't have it yet. All right, now, a couple more points. A beyond prok market fit, this is a little bit more theoretical. ([Time 0:31:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c36cca4b-3334-4824-9d95-2cbb62d71846))
- Scaling the Team
  Summary:
  Don't scale the team until you have product market fit a. Between about 23 and 25 is when everything breaks in a start up, because you can no longer be completely flat. Soth, there's aa essay here which he hubspot growth framework, which i'd highly recommend reading for a little bit more on this.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  right? Your your a a, your your the model, the wayth you charge people, you know, t doesn't work. Maybe you're not charging enough, maybe you're charging too much. That has a lot of interplay with your channel. And this is how you acquire customers, right? So if your model em ifi, for example, if you're building am a solution, and you're trying to charge 75 dollars a month for it, that's probn be a pretty tough spot to businessis because you're goig to be in the middle. You're knot going to be able to afford a sales force, right? You'r kotkoing o buld afford actual people selling your product to the customers directly, but it's too much money that people are going to want to just whip out their credit card and start paying that, right? And so that's why, oftentimes, you know, between the model and the channel, there needs to be a fit there as well. Because if you're going, if your gon to have a sales force, you're progonne to charge people at least two 300 dollars a month to build a ford the sales forse. And if you ar can to ave a sales horse, and you should probably charge 25 dollars a month or less. This all, of course, plays with the product and market fit a, which, which is how this all works together. Soth, there's aa essay here which he hubspot growth framework, which i'd highly recommend reading for a little bit more on this. A another side bar is on scaling the team. So i think this is a really important point to make, a don't scale the team until you have product market fit a. So i would not scale pass about 20 people. So around 20 people, choose. Between about 23 and 25 is when everything breaks in a start up, because you can no longer be, ah, just just, you know, completely flat. If you look at any of the essays, you know, if you look at, you kow back in the day, 37 signals hat this. Ssay is likt, how being a perfectly flat company is amazing, and no one ever needs to hire managers. Ansay, i could predict to within one or two employees, exactly the size you are, and it's about three to 25. And it turns out that was true, because about 23 t 25, it feels amazing. It's completely flat. Ah, just another couple of people and everything breaks. ([Time 0:34:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/41390d36-d7bf-40d1-b088-7f774521cdbd))
- Don't Track Signups, but Return and Retention
  Summary:
  The sad answer is, we were not monoring them. That's pry why it took us 18 months. It probably could have been a lot shorter. M i think if you look at howard's signms would convert to active users, that was very low. So by all accounts, we didn't have product market fit. And we knew we didn’t have productmarket fit. A, so itis really just matter f continue to iterate until you finally get something that that clicks. He tal ibit about you pricing, the journey ase went through prici, sure.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  product. At that point,
  Speaker 2
  can we talk about your k k p is doring that 18 months of period? What ou wer measuring to make sure that you are moving in the right direct?
  Speaker 1
  Yes. So the question is, on the k k p i during that 18 month period? A, the a. The sad answer is, we were not monoring them. We were not measuring them. That's pry why it took us 18 months. It probably could have been a lot shorter. I think we were looking sign ups, which was kind of the thing that most people were looking at at that point in time. And it's very poor metric. M i think if you look at howard's signms would convert to active users, that was very low. If you would look at howards sign ups were trending am sort of on a dailyand weekly basis, that was trending down. So by all accounts, we didn't have product market fit. And we knew we didn't have product market fit. M it wasn't like a big surprise. So a, so itis really just matter f continue to iterate. Continue to iterate until you finally get something that that clicks.
