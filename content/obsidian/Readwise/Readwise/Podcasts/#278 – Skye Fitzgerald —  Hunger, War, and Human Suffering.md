- The Last Hope Between War and Starvation in Yemen
  Transcript:

  And
  Speaker 2
  we'll talk about many cases like these throughout history. And going out to day. Let's talk about hunger ward. Ye, let's dive in. You are, you've been nominated for noscar twice. This is one of the times for a documentary. Can you please tell me what hunger ward, the last hope between war and starvation, is about? Hunger
  Speaker 1
  ward is a short documentary, um, that really is an attempt to illustrate the effects of the conflict on yemen, specifically on civilians. And we document it in in both the north and the south of the country, because it's a bifurcated country. The south is held by the globualy recognized government in the south, which, up until last week, was run by, at least on the surface, by president haddy hold up in riad a. He was essentially a removed from office last week by a, most people would agree, the emerades and the sades m to put ace of presidential council. So we wanted to show that starvation was happening in very similar fashions, both in the south and the north. So and we wanted to do this film because, a, so few people in the west know anything about the conflict in yemen, nor a the u. Ss complicity in it. And so my intent with the project was try to bring it to a larger western audience. Is an attempt to intervene and change the political status quow which allows the use of starvation in yemen to continue.

  Speaker 1
  cameras would you use? You know, what i do with the trillion dollars? I can do a lot. Yealo,

  Speaker 1
  i guess i would invest in crunt. I would, i would increase capacity to do more films. I set, i would do soas i would buy basically the perfect little, you know, many equipment set, right? I would train three teams, maybe, to do the same thing that i've been doing, so we could multiply and scale or more stories. Yes, that's what i would do with them on.

- Do You Use Lighting?
  Summary:
  I would increase capacity to do more films, i would buy basically the perfect little equipment set.

  what about lighting? Do you usually use natural light? Do you ever do? Ah, i mean, sorry for the technicale ons here, but a high lighting the drama of the human face. Y a, that's the visual that's art. That's like to reveal reality. Ah, at its deepest is art. And ah, do you use lighting? Lighting such a big part of that, dont us. Do
  Speaker 1
  you over do artificial lighting? Do you try to do natural always? You know, the best lighting instrument in the world is
  Speaker 2
  the sun at
  Speaker 1
  the right moment of the day. And so i predominantly use natural light, um, at certain moments. Um, and just shape natural light, um, during the course of these small human ride stalks.

- The Human Behind the Camera
  Summary:
  "We could film someone drowned in front of us, or we could put our cameras down and pull them out of the water," he says. "I had no sort of foreknowledge that i was going to find myself faced with that dilemma of the moment as a documentarian." He adds: 'Regardless of how the film would have been different if i hadn't made that choice, i made the right choice as a human being'
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  some of them couldn't swim. And so we found ourselves in this moment where we had a choice. We could film someone drowned in front of us, or we could put our cameras down and pull them out of the water. And so that's what we did, we put our cameras in the bottom of the zodiac and just started pulling people out of the water. And, um, you know, if i was wise man, according to his paradime, then we should have just filmed. And, ah, i didn't anticipate that moment beforehand. I had no sort of foreknowledge that i was going to find myself faced with that dilemma of the moment as a documentarian. But there was no question in my mind that i had to put my camera down and pull that fellow human being out of the water. And i don't regret it at all. So i've come to a different place. I've evolved to what i believe for the kind of film that i do is more appropriate right. Like i can go to sleep at night knowing that regardless of how the film would have been different if i hadn't made that choice, i made the right choice as a human being. So i think of it as being a human being first and a film maker second. In moments like that,
  Speaker 2
  that's beautifully, beautifully put. But i also think like you could be a human being in small ways too, like silly ways, and put a little bitt yourselfdin documentaries. I tend to see that as really beautiful. Like
