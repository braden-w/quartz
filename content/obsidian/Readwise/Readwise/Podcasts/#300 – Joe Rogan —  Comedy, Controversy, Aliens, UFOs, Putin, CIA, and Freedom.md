  And those of the ones we might be interacting with. They're all kind of dumb as we are, relatively, you know, maybe a few million years apart. And then those are the ones we're interacting with, and then we have a chance that actull connect with them and communicate with them. Or it could be like much more wide open, and you have these gigantic alion civilizations that are expanding very, very quickly. And the interesting thing is, when you look up at the sky andyou see the stars, that's the light from those stars. We might not be seeing the alien civilizations until they're ready here ing right? Like you start expanding, once you get really good at expanding, you're going to be expanding very close to the speed of light. So right now we don't see much in the sky, but there could be one. One day we wake up and it's just like everywhere, and they're here, right right?

- The Government Is Of The People
  Summary:
  I think most likely it's ta smoke screen. Most likely these are some sort of, like, incredibly advanced drones that they've developed and want to pretend don't exist. The reason why i'm skeptical is the government keeps talking about it. I mean, unless there's an imminent danger of us being invaded, and they want to prepare people so they don't freak out as much,. you know, lik maybe freak em out a little bit? That seems the more likely scenario.

  And the reason why i'm skeptical is the government keeps talking about it. The pentagon keeps talking about it now, so keeps talking about it. In which
  Speaker 2
  direction he sceptical. I
  Speaker 1
  sceptical that it's their aliens. I think most likely it's ta smoke screen. And most likely these are some sort of, like, incredibly advanced drones that they've developed that they want to pretend don't exist. That seems the more likely scenaria, ecause otherwise it might take is like, the benefit of them discussing these things, like, what's the benefit of them discussing these things openly? These are, you know, the way they described it, off world crafts, not made from this earth. Li why? Why were they, why woue they tell us that? I mean, unless there's an imminent danger of us being invaded, and they want to prepare people so they don't freak out as much, you know, lik maybe freak em out a little bit, say that publicly. The new york times article, the pentagon discussing it, all these different things. Haat the waters.
  Speaker 3
  Well,
  Speaker 1
  let people know that this is a thing, or my take is like that. I don't think they do that. I don't think they tell us. I think they, i think, i think the government has a lot of contempt for the citizens. I really do. I think they have contempt for our intelligence. They have for our need to know things.

  Summary:
  "It's one of the most important shows in comedy. It establishes stand up in a sense that, like for the open micre for people that are starting it out," he says. "There aren't the people that say that they're all bad at comedy. They're allbad at comedy."
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So, you eating ship is on there, forever, forever. The world can see it. But it's one of the most important shows in comedy. It's the most important show in comedy. Because, first of all, it establishes stand up in a sense that, like for the open micre for the people that are starting it out, it establishes that the most important thing is to be funny, like this is what the art form is all about. And there's a lot of insecurity attached to that, a lot of fears. And so to alleviate some of those insecurities and fears, people will decide that the message is more important, and they'll pretend that. You now, like you have to have, like a, you have to have, you have to be socially aware that you have to promote things that are positive in your comedy, which is bullshet. There aren't the people that say that they're all bad. They're all bad at comedy. And that's where the insecurity is. It's like they can't just kill, so they have to pretend that they're suposed to be socially aware and that being socially aware is an important parto society. Like, let me explain something really clearly. There's not a fucking person on earth who's ever changed their life because of a joke. That's not what they're there for. They're there for jokes. The people that say that, they, they say that socially important comedy is the only comedy that's necessary. The only comedy that you have to do that is just because they suck. That is it. It's like the cop out is that they can't do the real comedy. They can't crush. It's not like someone goes from being, you know, take like shane gillis, one of the best comics up and coming right now. He's falking fantastic. I can't recommend enough seeing that guy alive. I worked with him in ervine, and i hadn't seemed like his whole set, i was crying. I mean, he's so good. I
  Speaker 2
  heard hes racesi haven't listened to any of his material,
