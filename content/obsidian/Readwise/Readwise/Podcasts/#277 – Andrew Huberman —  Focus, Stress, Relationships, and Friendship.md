- I Love Barbecue
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Barbecue, i would say it's probably the, that's good
  Speaker 1
  ant imomen austin, i start thinking about barbecue, i do love, you know, i do love meat. My dad's argentine. I mean, i love steak. I love meat. I mean, argentinea coriso sausage is an appetizer before you have steak.
  Speaker 2
  Oh, it's mean, an ta meat. And
  Speaker 1
  it's not just, you know, it's not just the men, rigtyou see women, sometimes, very petite women, eating steaks that are bigger than their skull size, slowly. They eat very slowly there. And they all eat dessert too, which is interesting. And they generally do the sort of one meal per day. I' tdo that. Kind of reflectively, that's
  Speaker 2
  how i think about it, ecause i often eat one meal a day, especialy whn i'm travelling. It feels like a cheap meal, because it allows, it gives you a bit of more freedom to just lose yourself, the quantity of the food. I did the three day fasts, and i ate a chicken breast, like, literally chicken breasts with nothing else, just grilled. And it was the most delicious piece of meat i've ever eaten. And that, ah, a, that gives you the promise. When you fast th three days, you
  Speaker 1
  really can't pig out. You really shouldn't. You your stomach will shrink in size already. Your microbium is almost completely depleted by fasting. A lot of people think o cleanses and fasts are great for the microbium. They quash your microbium. However, when you start eating again, the microbium comes back better than it was before you're fast. Fut
  Speaker 2
  people don't know saganta anthe call ther kind of pulling stuff up. They just pulled up ther eps phelps with the homany calories as eating ten thousand. You know,
  Speaker 1
  it's interesting, there's some some cool physiology around this. The reason he needed to eat so much is not that he was burning that many calories in pure movement. ([Time 0:15:05](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d6152144-94ad-46d6-8fe0-0750b5a1497b))

  Speaker 1
  it's interesting, there's some some cool physiology around this. The reason he needed to eat so much is not that he was burning that many calories in pure movement. It's that when you do exercise in water, even if it's warm water, the heat transfer ing water is greater, so you burn far more calories. And again, here, im, i'm admittedly lifting that from a knowledge that was passed on to me by tim ferrisa. I did so, but i checked it out, and it's absolutely true. So if you exercise in water, even if it's not really cold water, your coloric needs go way up, whichis while you get out of the pool, and you're often really hungry.
  Speaker 2
  And for fans of the human lad pacas. Dif you're not a fan, what are you doing win your life? I you would probably chuckle at the fact that andrew just cited his sources even on that statementbecause you're so good.

- Psychologist and sociopaths
  Summary:
  Some therapists won't work with sociopaths because, um, they don't feel any progress can be made. Border lines are interest i should just mention, because they have this phenomenon of splitting. So in the in the world psychology, the idea is that being neurotic is actually the goal.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I ui be interesting from a i perspective of somebody who is a sociopather or psychopath, how to reveal something real about them. I think that requires not just, well, i don't know what that requires. They requires the same skill that it takes to be a good a therapist, right?
  Speaker 1
  And some therapists won't work with sociopaths because, um, they don't feel any progress can be made. Some therapists will work with sociopaths because, for the wealthy ones, they often, um, they want their money. I think most therapists are good and benevolent, but there're some that will do it just the same way lawyers will work with criminals, knowing they're criminals, right? Am, oftentimes because they're criminals. There are certain domains of psychiatry that are more tractable than others, right? Border lines are interest i should just mention, because they have this phenomenon of splitting. So in the in the world psychology, the idea is that being neurotic is actually the goal.

- How to Achieve Focus on a Task
  Summary:
  There are a lot of things that will modulate your state of focus, but they don't directly mediate your sense of focus. For people to have problems focusing, sleep, well, learn to dilate and contract your visual field consciously. And then, as i said before, it is very hard to get into a state of focus like a step function immediately, like snapping your fingers. What you can do is you can pick any object, but ideally an object at roughly the same distance to which you're going to do that work, and stare at it. You're allowed to blink. Much of the training that's being done now in china to teach kids to focus better literally
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yes, first of all, we have to distinguish between modulators and mediators, and i'll do this very briefly. There are a lot of things that will modulate your state of focus, but they don't directly mediate your sense of focus. So for instance, if right now a fire alarm went off in this building, it would modulate our attention, we would get up and leave. It would be very hard to do what we're doing with at banging in the background, least at first. So it's modulating focus, but it's not really involved in the mechanisms of focus. Right? In the same way, being well rested when you sleep, your autonomic nervous system that adjusts states of alertness and focus and calm works better than when you're sleep deprived. So if you're sleeping better, you're going to focus better. So i always answer this way to a question like because the best thing that anyone can do for their mental health, physical health and performance in athletic or cognitive endeavors or creative endeavors, is to make sure that you're getting enough quality sleep, enough of the time for you. And that's going to differ. We could talk about what that means now, in terms of things that mediate focus, without getting inte description of mechanisms, cause we have podcasts about that. It's very clear that mental focus follows visual focus, provided you're a sighted person. Much of the training that's being done now in china to teach kids to focus better literally has them stare at a target, blinking ever so often. But really training themselves, to breathe calmly and maintain a tight visual aperture. When you read, you have to maintain a tight visual aperture. You're literally scrolling like a high lighter in your s eye, right? It's kind of obvious once you hear it. So for people to have problems focusing, sleep, well, learn to dilate and contract your visual field consciously. This can be done if you practise it a little bit. And then, as i said before, it is very hard to get into a state of focus like a step function immediately, like snapping your fingers. What you can do is you can pick any object, but ideally an object at roughly the same ae, placed it roughly the same distance to which you're going to do that work, and stare at it. You're allowed to blink. And as your mind starts to drift every once in a while, to understand that's normal. But try to narrow your visual aperture and bring that ([Time 2:24:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/27f13cb0-2d7f-4ba3-ae86-0fe32cfdc235))
- Cold Water Immersion After Training Reduces Inflammation, Don't Do It
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  But me, he just had a very systematic way of describing things that was really nice. Skill, speed, power, strength, hypotrophy, so muscle mass, right? Endurance, all kinds. And then philosophical like adaptation, overload stuff, all that very is there stuff? I'll ask you about ice bath and son, which was surprise to me. There is there stuff you took away from that conversation, like principles about how to get strong, how to build muscle mass, that
  Speaker 1
  like broaden an and deepened your understanding of that task? Definitely. And i'll do these in bullet points, ecause if people want the logic behind them and the mechanism, they can listen to that episode. It's a reall goodisode. They'll start with heat and cold, really, and just say that avoid cold immersion. So ice baths and being in cold water up to the neck, uncomfortably cold, within the four hours after a training session that's designed to evoke an adaptation, either endurance, hypertrophy or strength. Because the inflammation that you experience from a hard endurance workout, or from a hard strength or a hypertrophy workout, is the stimulus by that you're going to adapt to. The cold water immersion reduces inflammation and can short circuit some of that. After four hours, you're probably ok but if you can do it a different day, or you can do it before those sessions, that's better.

The cold water immersion reduces inflammation and can short circuit some of that. After four hours, you're probably ok but if you can do it a different day, or you can do it before those sessions, that's better. Heat, however, can be done immediately after training, and is probably beneficial because of the way that it dilates the vascular system and deliver porfuses the muscles and ligaments, et cetera, with more nutrients. An a, an, that was a
  Speaker 2
  crucial piece of information. It's a little bit surprising. Was it surprising to you? Absolutely. Because i actually, the way i posed the question to him about cold was,
  Speaker 1
  i hear that getting into an ice bath or a cold water immersion after training can reduce hypertrovy, but i'm guessing it's not that big of a deal. And he said, no, it is a big deal. It will short circuit your progress. Now for people, they are only interested in performance, who are doing a lot of workouts in trying to recover, but not trying to grow muscle, get stronger or build indr then it makes sense to do cold skilled development, kill development. Or you're an athlete in season, you know, seapto. What's so great about andy as he really points out the specific ways to train given your specific goal. So forget and swoll, stay

- Do You Know How To Train For Strength?
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Heas, one
  Speaker 1
  of these days im wone to get back to jugis ori mong to get two jugits. Now, in terms of training, he has this beautiful three by five concept for strength. Pick three exercises, compound exercises, multi joint movements. Do them for do three to five exercises for three to five repetitions per set, rest three to five minutes. And do that three to five times per week. And for details, you can, again, look to the episode. It's time stamped. But what's interesting about this is, three to five times a week is a lot for a muscle group. Squatting five times a week for five reps, meaning you're working pretty heavy, meaning you're close to failure, but not failure. For strength generally. What andy taught me is that people who are training mostly for strength can these low retype regimens frequently because most of the adaptation is neural. And because you're not pushing to failure, in most cases, you don't get that sore. And so it's the motor neurons getting the muscle fibres to contract more intensely or with more efficiency in other ways, that's leading to these strength gains. And this is why power lifters can train every day, or five a week, or four days a week. For hypertrophy. I learned from andy that the repetition range can be pretty broad. You think anywhere from six to 30 repetitions. You should do ten sets per muscle group per week, maybe even a bit more, to high volume, high volume. But you have to go to failure or beyond in order to growth. Why does it work at such a great range of repetitions? Well, there apparently are three ways that you stimulate hypertrophy, and maybe more. One is tissued, micro damage to the tissue. The other is through some sort of tension base changes in the molecular gene programms of cells that lead to protein synthesis that that are distinct from damage. Nd. The other are metabolic effects, like high repetition work of superfusion of the muscle with blood. ([Time 2:47:32](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dd387144-f1bf-4538-80f2-391c61456d1d))
- Cold Showers After Training
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And i should mention that cold showers after training
  Speaker 1
  don't seem to short circuit the a, the training effect, to the same extent that immersion in cold water does. And that really speaks of the fact that cold showers, even though they can provide some of the drenlin for the mental effects of like, oh, i have a lot of adrenel in my system from a cold shower, and i can remain calm, there's utility to that, it's not going to have the same metabolic effects, or other positive effects that cold water exposure has been shown have. And that's unfortunate, because most people have access to cold showers. Nwhat? Everyone has access to a cold dunker and ice stunk.

- The Tough Way To Cold Bath is More Helpful
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Heat and cold pull you down from the inside. You have there's a reason why the screening process for a make, you know, seal steel. They call it seal training, but it's really screening and training involves cold water s cause, you know, if you're in the heat too long, you'll die or damage tissue. In cold, you can do it quite extensively before you dier damage tissue. But it is stressful. I was going to say one thing that am, i sometimes enjoy seeing these social medio posts where people into the ice bath. They'll look really stoic, like they're really tough, ah, but actually that's the wimpy way to go through it. When you get into cold water, if you stay very still, you develop a thermal sheath around you that you're warming yourself. The really bold way is to get in and continue to sift your arms and legs. And it ends up feeling miserably colder. And thens no sheath, cause there's you break os on the bringing u that thermal layer. And then when you get out, you'll notice a lot of people huddle where they'll they'll put or they'll grab the towel. In general, that's me. I'll get back. I'll get into the sanna. But if you really want to stimulate the big increases in metabolism, you stand out there and you dry off with arms extended in open air. And as that water evaporates off you, it is really cold, but your body is forced to activate umber of the warming programmes related to metabolism. This is the beautiful work of a woman named susanna soberg, who's a scandinavian. She published this paper last year in cell reports medicine. And so i call this the soberg principle, which is, if you're doing ice and heat for whatever reason, doesn't matter if you end on heat or cold. But if you're using cold specifically to stimulate an increase in metabolism. End with cold, that's the soberg principle. And
  Speaker 2
  with cold, yet, yo, alternating and then, ah, if you want to do t the tough way, you let the shivering sothat you just stand out and let the water evaporatenif
  Speaker 1
  you ever waded into a cold ocean, you know everybody's kind of like holding themselves ret you know, if you really just, if you let yourself extend your limbs and move them around a bit, so you break up that thermal layer. Ah, that's, that's the tough way to it. So when i see people on social media getting in and they'r loe really tough and trying to look hard.

- The Effects of Hormones on Sexual Development
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Well, we did an episode early on on sexual development. Yes. We've done them on optimizing test astron and astraga. And we touched a little bit on the on libido, and somewhat on sex performance, but not much. We did an episode on relationships, love and desire, where we touched on libido specifically. So just as a quick mention of something a lot of people take, s s ares or antidepressents that can disrupt sexual function. There are a few compounds like maca root and tonga ali and things like that, that, at least in a few studies in humans, have been shown to offset some of the the sexual side affects. A now, in terms of sexual and then the, sorry, the episode on sexual development was about how the brain and body become organized in certain ways, how the brain becomes organized if you have ex chromosomes or y chromosomesr et ceteraerly, early, early development, mainly. And the effects of hormons. Later on. That template, we will be doing a mac putting together a ser s on sexual health, everything from the menstrual cycle, which both men and women should understand, of course, a understanding arousal. Understanding, for instance, lo people don't realize this, but that a orgasm is actually the consequence of activity in the sympathetic, meaning the stress arm of the autonomic nervous system, whereas arousal is the con sequence of the activity of the para sympathetic, the calming aspect of of of the odeni contitutive. It's counter intuitive, and it count works like a seasaw. Nd there's arousal, then there's relaxation, then there's arousal. But the theumb and then immediately after orgasm, and in male's ejaculation. What ends up happening is there's a rebounding of the para sympathetic nervous system, which it leads to, oftentimes, people feeling very relaxed or falling.

  I'm working on getting an expert guest who can talk about some of the noralogic changes that happen um as a consequence of sexual activity.

But we're going to do an episode on menipas andrewpas. What's very surprising is i get a lot of questions about sexual health from the young male audience a, which tells me that, well, here's what i think it reflects. I think women, because of their menstral cycles early on, start to talk to one another about changes in physiology and psychology as a function of this 28 day cycle that they all experience sooner or later. Males, there's less of a conversation, and it usually arrives in code. People say, what should i take to increase my testostrone? And i'll say, maybe nothing, you know, a what are you specifically concerned about? And then overtime, if you pull on those threads a little bit, you know, you get your answer. Sometimes i'll just get a direct question a. But i think that a, the psychology of all thisnd in terms of jealousy and the terms of a, notions of of a rolls and relationships, is very dynamic right now. And i'm fascinated by this. So we're going to do a four episode series. What about sexual fantasy? What

- The Power Dynamic in Relationships
  Summary:
  Be good at autonomic self regulation. Know how to calm yourself down. Don't expect looking to anything external to soothe yourself, as it puts you in a terrible position to be a caretaker of yourself and other people. There is a power dynamic in relationships. Sometimes not all, but in some elationships, it works much better if one person leads and the other person follows. People need to know what they need.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  There
  Speaker 1
  isn't just one, but at at least in the top five is master, or at least be good at autonomic self regulation. Know how to calm yourself down. Don't expect looking to anything external to soothe yourself, as it puts you in a terrible position to be a caretaker of yourself and other people, right? So learn how to self soothe, right? Learn how to calm your mind, steady your action, steady your voice. There are tools to do that. We talk about in the podcast, but elsewhere, have that in place. I also think that if if your main focus is on you want to have good boundaries, et cetera, but on tending to the relationship, doing a little bit more than you think you ought to do, if everyone does that, it goes great. And i'm sometimes so positively struck by how supported i feel am, because for many years i ave just con doing everything on my own. So any little thing on my homey gooness, this feels huge. A and also, i think the dynamics have to be right. Let's, let's be really honest. This is a little bit of a tricky topic, but, um, there is a power dynamic in relationships. Sometimes not all, but in some elationships, it works much better if one person leads and the other person follows. In other relationships, it's more mutuality works best. People need to know what they need. And so knowing what you need and what you crave is really important. And then once you do that, you can create the relationship you want. I've seen that over and over again. And people are different, um, but i think that am ultimately imean, right? It's, it's, there's the dopomine phase of a relationship, then there's the seratonian phase, the kind of more mutuality, cosiness and sweetness. There's a great book about how to make sure that the dopomine component and the seratonan component, so to speak, go on forever. And it has to do with you know, when you first meet some one, n yor attracted to them, you're essentially objectifying them. O meaning, not the way people might think. You are not dependent on them for emotional stability or survival. As you get close tit somebody, you really come to depend on them, and then you tend to objectify them less.

  right? It's, it's, there's the dopomine phase of a relationship, then there's the seratonian phase, the kind of more mutuality, cosiness and sweetness. There's a great book about how to make sure that the dopomine component and the seratonan component, so to speak, go on forever.

So human beings need to learn how to at least understand and control these dynamics. ([Time 3:20:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/25ac6a8d-33cf-4d85-9754-889560dc6d59))
