- The Secret to Unlocking This Is Through Artificial Intelligence
  Summary:
  If we really succeed in figuring out what intelligence is, and how to build things that are as intelligent as aws of physics allow. could solve all sorts of problems that our human intelligence has been stumped by so far. Anything you would like to do which we haven't been smart enough to do yet,. cure cancer, eliminate poverty, help people live exciting, inspiring lives, can be given to us through artificial intelligence.

  We could solve all sorts of problems that our human intelligence has been stumped by so far. And if you get a bit more nirty about it, which i love to do as a physicist, then it's quite obvious that if we really succeed in figuring out what intelligence is, and how to build things that are as intelligent as aws of physics allow, you know, that we would shift from suddenly being limited, not by what we can figure out, to just being limited by the laws of physics. And you can get nerty on that and realize that it's just so many orders of magnitude more in all ways. If you ask how much compute per second get, or if you ask how how possible it is to go travel to other galaxies, or basic any actes you're excited about, we're nowhere near the limits that the laws of physics place the speed of light, that you can't be stuff like that. And the secret to unlocking this is through artificial intelligence. Now, so that's the upside. Basically, anything you would like to do which we haven't been smart enough to do yet, cure cancer, eliminate poverty, help people live exciting, inspiring lives, or for that matter, if you would like to help help life spread throughout our observe, much of our servable universe. Any of those things, artificial intelligence has a potential to give them to you. And moreover. You don't have to wait millions of years, like in the syphi novels. It's quite likely that, i believe, we could get this in our lifetime. So that's the upside. But we also know that every tool we have is a double edged sword, not just a sword. But take something innocuous like fire, for ([Time 0:17:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d514794c-d708-475f-b3ed-2b222f547465))
- Intelligence is Information Processing
  Summary:
  Skeptics and optimists are all over the place, even very educated people. It says more about peoples personality traits than anything scientific. Some people tend to becone of hopeful and optimistic about everything. And it's pretty obvious that we are not the most optimized cork blobs possible for information processing. You can keep swabping up out your hardware and using the same alegarithms. Of course not.

  First of all, sociologically, spot on there. Rob people are really all over the place, even very educated people. And there are these two basic dimensions you outline first the question of, well, how soon and will this happen, and how far will it go? Where you'll have some people like my former m i t colleague, professor rodney brooks, who says it's not going to happen for 300 years, ther we'll even to human level, and a hundred % sure. And then you have other people, which aren't actually most people in the technical community now, who think tits can happen a lot sooner. And recent poles of ai researchers tend to predict that ao decades from now, we'll have a that can do basically all our human jobs, or cheaper than we can. That that's one axis where you can basicaly classify people from techno sceptics to think it's never going to work, to techno optimists. And then on the other axis, it's do they think this is going to suck, or going to be great? Where maybe it actually says more about peoples personality traits and whether than than anything scientific, really where they land on that. Some people tend to becone of hopeful and optimistic about everything. Some people are more prone to wishful thinking than others. If we take the first one, the question of what will actually happen, i think a very common misconception, specially among scientists, is that intelligence is something mysterious that can only exist inside of biological organisms like human beings and te if we've learned anything from physics, it's that the no, intelligence is about information processing. And it really doesn't ter whether the information is processed by a carbon atom, by carbon atoms in neurons in brains, in people, or by silican atoms in some g pu somewhere. It's the information processing itself that matters. It's this sub straight independent nature information processing t hat doesn't matter whether it's a mack or a pc you're running it on, or linnox box, or for that matter, what the cpu manufacture is, or even whether it's biological or silican base that matters. It's just the information processing that matters. That's really been the number one corps idea. I would say, that that's caused the tion at nai, that you can keep swabping up out your hardware and using the same alegarithms. Whence you once you accept that that you and i are blobs of corks and electrons that happen to be arranged in a way such that they can process information, well, it's pretty obvious that, unless you have weigh more hubrous than i do, you know that the we are not the most optimized cork blobs possible for information processing. Of course ([Time 0:20:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4d7f1c7e-0d48-460e-a864-6fc9692f43fd))
- It Took 100 More Years to Discover How Birds Fly After Flying Machine
  Summary:
  There's awesome ted talk that anyone listening to shood google, about how they actually built the flying bird. Y. But it took 100 years longer to figure out how birds fly than to build somethinga, an other kind of machine that could fly even faster than birds. It just turned out that the reason bird's flight was so complicated was bcause birds evolution optimize birds, not just a fly.

- The Inequality of Human Workers
  Summary:
  Income inequality in western countries has gone up a lot. Information technology is the number one cause of this, he says. More companies will become facebook like rit where ch of the value is added by the m l and i think forward is what we need.

So that's something that's here. The third one is income inequality. No, in er. I haven't looked specifically at the u k. Income in equality recently, but most western countries it's gone up a lot. And some a populist politicians like to blame the chinese or the mexicans for this. Others like to blame some political party for this. But e many of my economist friends argue that maybe the number one cause is actually information technology itself. It's pretty obvious, if you place human workers by machines, that the money that was previously paid in salaries to humans for doing the work will now get paid to the owners of the machines, who were normally richer to start with. So that drives inequality. Vevery simple example to look at as if just compared, for example, ford with facebook. So ford has wey more employees and a much smaller market cap than facebook. Last time i checked, i think facebook has about a hundred times as much market cap per employee as ford does. So facebook is a more future kind of companyh more companies will become facebook like rit where ch of the value is added by the m l, then forward is and i ([Time 0:33:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5d28817a-47cd-4757-b889-896b90efda25))
- Information a technology Drives Inequality
  Summary:
  Income inequality has gone up in most western countries. Information technology may be the biggest cause of this, says Dr Andrew Keen. The money that was previously paid to humans for doing the work will now get paid to the owners of the machines - who were normally richer to start with.

And you might think that's fine, because the rising tie, it raises all boats. ([Time 0:33:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f0a2f5e3-eb4e-4264-a4ae-612d397b5be0))

- Social Incentives as Alignment to Greater Good
  Summary:
  In world religions, it's often been phrase s the reason that we should do this is because of some higher principle. But from an evolution point of view, you could also understand ita that this is an elightend mechanism that favored the groups that had it - so they could compete better against the other ones. And then if we som out more, as we go to the really big picture, when societyies got still bigger, we decided to start to codify the stuff and invented the whole idea of a legal system. If you know that or fight, if you really did kill the other guy well, then you're going to be spending many years in a small room eating kind

  Andand that's another very powerful aligment mechanism, if you think about it, where if you get a reputation as being a compulsive liar, or someone as very trustworthy, you get socially punished in various ways. You have an incentive to be honest and trustworthy and loyal. And why is that exactly? Youve in world religions, it's often been phrase s the reason that we should do this is because of some higher principle. But from an evolution point of view, you could also understand ita that this is an elightend mechanism that favored the groups that had it, so they could compete better against the other ones, right? Right? And then if we som out more, as we go to the really big picture, when societyies got still bigger, we decided to start to codify the stuff, so that we invented the whole idea of a legal system, saying that if you know that or fight, if you really did kill the other guy well, then you're going to actually, you have the concentive a.

- Agents of Bounded Rationality
  Summary:
  Theorists would call itor a shady nash equilibrium, if you're an economic buff so the basic antidote totow those problems is always coordination, better coordination. That's why we still haven't solved climate change, for example, or, for that matter, the nuclear arms raise. We are what, in machine learning nordspeak, is known as an agent of bounded rationality. And because of that, we can be hacked. So even if we tried to always do what was in your own personal best interest, yo, suppose someone had solved this, this multi scale alignment, ok, and set up the things so that if you just did what was inyour interests for al

That's why we still haven't solved climate change, for example, or, for that matter, the nuclear arms raise. But that's, it's even worse, cause that's not the only issue. We've already alluded to a little, but another issue is, even if we tried to always do what was in your own personal best interest, yo, suppose someone had solved this, this multi scale alignment, ok, and set up the things so that if you just did what was in your interests for ala, your incentives, things would work out great for everyone. You might not be able to figure out actually, what's best for you, because the world is complicated. Whiht if you had sort of fictitious, infinitely powerful, super hyper computer, you can think through every possible action. And and what impact i would have if we don't have that. We are what, in machine learning nordspeak, is known as an agent of bounded rationality. We have a finite amount of neurons, a fininte amount of time to think, and we have to divide that between doing many different tasks. And because of that, we can be hacked. And we mean, we can often fail.
