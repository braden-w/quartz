## Highlights
- What's Sobering About January 6th?
  Summary:
  Before the sixth, what's incredibly sobering is that there was this incredibly comprehensive effort to overturn the results of the election. That depended a great deal on if mike pence had just said, yes, where would we have been? We would have been through the looking glass on a constitutional crisis. And then after mike pince says no, this is one thing that's incredibly sobered to me,. as if you look at the approval ratings of donald trump and mike pice after january sixth, their approval rating plunges, and its mikes pince, not donald trump. Incredible. Not even the shock of the moment of january sixth could shake people

  right? Well, you no, think about what we've learned about january sixth since january sixth, idnt you know, if youre think the two things, both before the sixth and after the sixth, that are particularly sobering to me. So, before the sixth, what's incredibly sobering is that there was, as we've now learned, this incredibly comprehensive effort to overturn the results of the election. That depended a great deal on if mike pence had just said, yes, where would we have been? We would have been through the looking glass on a constitutional crisis. If it in all this pressure focused on mike pent's saying yes to this comprehensive scheme to either flip the results write there on january sixth, or send them back to the states, and then creating an enormous of chaos. And then after mike pince says no, this is one thing that's incredibly sobering to me, as if you look at the approval ratings of donald trump and mike pince after january sixth, one of ther only one of the two, their approval rating plunges, and its mike pince, not donald trump. Incredible. So what that told me is that you had a republican party tat was so fully committed to this election steel effort, that even a long time republican who had stood by donald trump's side every moment of his presidency, who then appeals to his faith as an evangel lical who is sort of the representative of the evangelical base and the trump administration, appeals to his faith to do the right thing, and he's rejected by his own movement in favor of donald trump. And to me, in some ways, that was as sobering as all the ents that happened before that, not even the shock of the moment of january sixth could shake people from this hyper partisanship and animosity and distrust that led them down the road. Toto, stop the steel effort. ([Time 0:07:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b40ff5b0-4fe4-4d78-b51d-a19c1563b532))
- The Far Right and the Far Left Have a Lot in Common
  Summary:
  i think that we certainly have differences on a number of fronts. We're both small l liberals and both committed to american pluralism. And this is where i feel like the far right and the far left actually have a lot more in common than one might think. A woke and anti woke have a lot in common.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Ya, a, well, you know, only one thing. Just going back to what you were saying a moment ago, about our differences, i think that we certainly have differences on a number of fronts. We're both small l liberals and both committed to american pluralism. So in other words, you know, we both see a roll in a place, and should, and there should be a roll in a place for for each of us in american system. In the american, the american system is supposed to exist, is supposed to provide a place where atheist, atheist and christian can live side by side, and both communities can flourish, that sort of hall mark of the american classical liberal system when it's functioning well. And so i've always perceived you as being quite committed to american pluralism. And this is, i think, where a lot of the new, there's an old culture war, which is over things like gun control or abortion or religious liberty, and and there'san its being supplanted, i think, by a new culture ward that is really, quite frankly, over liberalism and pluralism itself. And and this is where i feel like the far right and the far left actually have a lot more in common than one might think. A woke and anti woke have a lot in common. And and the thing that they have in common is they are deeply questioning that american small liberalism. They're deeply questioning pluralism. And, you know, for example, the critical race theory argument. ([Time 0:26:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ad86fee1-51c2-4dad-ac3f-40203c7df692))
- Trump Wins Perceived as Divine Intervention
  Summary:
  The data indicates that trump's initial support was, a lot of it was located in non church going evangelicals. So there were some who were early in on trump, but then the snow ball effect locked in. The shocking victoryor the fact that nobody predicted, or very few people predicted, that he'd win, sent a messenger millions of tians that this was divine intervention. And i think that was the moment where allot of this loyalty locked in in a way that a lot of people don't truly appreciate it.

  Well,
  Speaker 1
  some were early sos. You know, trump gained a lot of support pretty quickly. Now, the interesting thing was, the data indicates that trump's initial support was, a lot of it was located in non church going evangelicals. I know that sounds like a strange thing to say, non church going evangelicals, but sort of the more disconnected you were, the more the the disconnected you were from civic institutions, including a congregation, the more likely you are to support trump early on. But then once trump gained the nomination and it was him and hilary, then, of course, the dynamic changed. And so i think you you began to have a snowball effect. So there were some who were early in on trump, but then the snow ball effect locked in. And then the other thing that was really important othe sort of thi faith and prophecy based mind set, was the shocking victoryor the fact that nobody predicted, or very few people predicted, that he'd win, and he did win, sent a messenger millions of tians that this was divine intervention. And i think that was the moment where allot of this loyalty locked in in a way that a lot of people don't truly appreciate it. And i saw it happen in my community, and i saw it happen with my own eyes. ([Time 0:42:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/68254b36-af79-456d-ba36-045d29be4f62))
