## Highlights
- Speaker 0: at stanford School of Medicine. 
  Speaker 1: Today we are discussing aggression, 
  Speaker 0: I'm 
  Speaker 1: going to explain to you that there are several different 
  Speaker 0: types of aggression. 
  Speaker 1: For instance reactive aggression 
  Speaker 0: versus proactive aggression meaning 
  Speaker 1: sometimes people will be aggressive because they feel threatened 
  Speaker 0: or they are 
  Speaker 1: protecting those that they love, who 
  Speaker 0: also feel threatened. There's also 
  Speaker 1: proactive aggression 
  Speaker 0: where people go out of their 
  Speaker 1: way to deliberately 
  Speaker 0: try and harm others 
  Speaker 1: and there is indirect aggression which is aggression not 
  Speaker 0: involving physical violence 
  Speaker 1: for instance shaming 
  Speaker 0: people and things of that sort, 
  Speaker 1: it turns out that there are different biological 
  Speaker 0: mechanisms 
  Speaker 1: underlying each of the different types of aggression 
  Speaker 0: and today I will define those for you. I'll talk about the neural circuits in the brain and body that 
  Speaker 1: mediate each of the different kinds of ([Time 0:00:12](https://www.airr.io/quote/627faac73782e70d240e1a9d))
- Speaker 0: some of the hormones and 
  Speaker 1: peptides and neurotransmitters involved. 
  Speaker 0: I promise to make it all 
  Speaker 1: accessible to you, even if you do not 
  Speaker 0: have any biology or science background. I 
  Speaker 1: also discussed 
  Speaker 0: tools, psychological 
  Speaker 1: tools and biological tools that one can use to better 
  Speaker 0: control aggression. 
  Speaker 1: Now right here at the 
  Speaker 0: outset I want to acknowledge 
  Speaker 1: that any discussion about aggression has to 
  Speaker 0: have an element of context within it 
  Speaker 1: to be fair human beings invest 
  Speaker 0: a lot of money a lot of time and a lot of 
  Speaker 1: energy and indeed can even derive pleasure 
  Speaker 0: from aggression. 
  Speaker 1: Later I'll talk about neural circuits in the brain and 
  Speaker 0: body that 
  Speaker 1: reinforce, in other words, reward through the release of chemicals 
  Speaker 0: that make people feel good 
  Speaker 1: acts of ([Time 0:00:58](https://www.airr.io/quote/627faad93782e70d240e2780))
- Speaker 0: following him. He had a habit of 
  Speaker 1: geese adopting 
  Speaker 0: him because of the 
  Speaker 1: behaviors that he partook in. So he would swim out on a lake in front of a bunch of little geese and then they would think 
  Speaker 0: that he was the parent and they would imprint on him. 
  Speaker 1: He even lived with these 
  Speaker 0: animals and they lived with him, sort of a strange character from what I hear. 
  Speaker 1: But nonetheless, 
  Speaker 0: all this work was deserving of the Nobel 
  Speaker 1: prize because what he discovered were fixed action 
  Speaker 0: patterns that 
  Speaker 1: is patterns of behavior that could be evoked by a single 
  Speaker 0: stimulus. Okay, 
  Speaker 1: this is really important. The idea that you can get a whole category 
  Speaker 0: of behaviors like 
  Speaker 1: swimming behind a parent or looking to 
  Speaker 0: somebody for comfort and 
  Speaker 1: only them. The idea that you could get a huge category of different behaviors in a bunch of different ([Time 0:11:45](https://www.airr.io/quote/627fab723782e70d240e806b))
- Speaker 0: logical 
  Speaker 1: intent and 
  Speaker 0: purpose. He wasn't just poking around in there for fun. He was 
  Speaker 1: trying to identify brain regions that could generate entire 
  Speaker 0: categories of behavior. Allah 
  Speaker 1: Lawrence 
  Speaker 0: wright! These fixed action pattern behaviors. 
  Speaker 1: Eventually his electrode landed in a site and he provided 
  Speaker 0: electrical stimulation to the cat 
  Speaker 1: that caused this otherwise passive 
  Speaker 0: purring, 
  Speaker 1: relaxing cat to suddenly go into an absolute 
  Speaker 0: rage. So 
  Speaker 1: arched, back hissing hair 
  Speaker 0: up, so called pilo 
  Speaker 1: erection. Where the hairs go up. 
  Speaker 0: Animals try to make themselves as big as possible often 
  Speaker 1: when they are aggressive drooling, maybe even spitting. 
  Speaker 0: Believe it or not, ([Time 0:17:42](https://www.airr.io/quote/627fabfb3782e70d240edde1))
- Speaker 0: the experimenters call it 
  Speaker 1: and then afterwards 
  Speaker 0: that he will dismount. 
  Speaker 1: Okay, so they observed this kind of mounting and 
  Speaker 0: and sex behavior 
  Speaker 1: is very typical. But about halfway through 
  Speaker 0: the behavior 
  Speaker 1: day you turned on the light to stimulate these estrogen receptor contain neurons only in the 
  Speaker 0: male mouse. And 
  Speaker 1: what she observed was incredibly 
  Speaker 0: dramatic. 
  Speaker 1: The male mouse ceases from trying to mate with the female mouse and immediately tries 
  Speaker 0: to kill the female mouse. 
  Speaker 1: He starts attacking her. Then she turns off the light, the mail stops and goes 
  Speaker 0: back to trying to mate with the female mouse. I'm sure all of this was very confusing 
  Speaker 1: and disturbing 
  Speaker 0: to the female mouse. Nonetheless, that was the repertoire 
  Speaker 1: they would meet. She would stimulate these ([Time 0:28:06](https://www.airr.io/quote/627fae3d3782e70d24107272))
- Speaker 1: alone, but with a rubber glove filled with 
  Speaker 0: air water mouse walking 
  Speaker 1: around sniffing peeing, 
  Speaker 0: which is what male mice seem to do. They seem to urinate everywhere. 
  Speaker 1: Especially an interesting, 
  Speaker 0: perhaps interesting feature of male mice and actually 
  Speaker 1: many male animals, 
  Speaker 0: perhaps even humans, we don't know or maybe we do 
  Speaker 1: know basically 
  Speaker 0: there's been observed time and time again in experiments 
  Speaker 1: mainly by lisa's 
  Speaker 0: towers lab at the Scripps Institute is characterized 
  Speaker 1: this if you put female mice into an arena or a cage, they always urinate in a very small 
  Speaker 0: corner of that cage. 
  Speaker 1: Whereas if you put male mice into 
  Speaker 0: an arena or a 
  Speaker 1: cage that urinate 
  Speaker 0: everywhere. They have this kind of obsession with spraying their urine everywhere. You can um sort of transpose that to human behavior if you like. 
  Speaker 1: In any event. ([Time 0:29:46](https://www.airr.io/quote/627fae633782e70d241081fd))
- Speaker 0: although I do remember your name, I'm not gonna tell you what his name was. 
  Speaker 1: A kid jumped on my back and bit 
  Speaker 0: me on the top of my back 
  Speaker 1: and this of course resulted in a discussion and in 
  Speaker 0: a time out and all the usual things and parents I think got involved. I don't recall, 
  Speaker 1: I didn't think much 
  Speaker 0: else of it, but 
  Speaker 1: I recall that this was considered especially troubling behavior because he bit me as opposed to hit me or shoved 
  Speaker 0: me down or something that sort 
  Speaker 1: and it does seem as if the tendency to use biting as an aggressive 
  Speaker 0: behavior 
  Speaker 1: is associated with a more 
  Speaker 0: primitive circuitry. Now, 
  Speaker 1: here I'm truly 
  Speaker 0: anthropomorphizing. I don't know what this other kid happened to be thinking or feeling at the time. How could I? 
  Speaker 1: And I certainly 
  Speaker 0: am not going to say 
  Speaker 1: that biting in 
  Speaker 0: every case reflects ([Time 0:34:01](https://www.airr.io/quote/627faec53782e70d2410ca67))
- Speaker 1: In order to understand this, I just want to briefly refer back to 
  Speaker 0: a conversation that I had on a previous episode of the Huberman lab podcast and that was with my 
  Speaker 1: colleague, the great 
  Speaker 0: robert Sapolsky, of course is a professor at stanford who studied 
  Speaker 1: testosterone and 
  Speaker 0: its impacts on behavior 
  Speaker 1: as well as estrogen 
  Speaker 0: and other hormones and their impacts on behavior. 
  Speaker 1: To make a long story short and to dispel a still 
  Speaker 0: unfortunately very common 
  Speaker 1: myth. Testosterone does not increase 
  Speaker 0: aggressiveness. 
  Speaker 1: Testosterone increases pro activity and the willingness to lean into effort in competitive 
  Speaker 0: scenarios. 
  Speaker 1: Sometimes this is referred to as the challenge 
  Speaker 0: hypothesis but 
  Speaker 1: two make a long story short ([Time 0:36:34](https://www.airr.io/quote/627faf003782e70d2410f194))
- Speaker 0: lee that they naturally make, 
  Speaker 1: What you'll find is that testosterone tends to increase competitiveness, but not just in 
  Speaker 0: aggressive scenarios. 
  Speaker 1: So if somebody is already aggressive, giving them testosterone will have the tendency to 
  Speaker 0: make them more aggressive. 
  Speaker 1: If somebody, however, is very benevolent and altruistic giving them 
  Speaker 0: testosterone will make them more benevolent and 
  Speaker 1: altruistic, at least up to 
  Speaker 0: a point now, of course, 
  Speaker 1: there are certain forms of synthetic 
  Speaker 0: testosterone that are 
  Speaker 1: known in sports circles 
  Speaker 0: and in other circles 
  Speaker 1: to increase aggressiveness because of 
  Speaker 0: the way those particular forms 
  Speaker 1: of synthetic 
  Speaker 0: testosterone is work. But in 
  Speaker 1: general, most of the 
  Speaker 0: experiments that I'm referring to have not been done using 
  Speaker 1: those, they've been done 
  Speaker 0: using ([Time 0:37:27](https://www.airr.io/quote/627faf153782e70d2410fd2f))
- Speaker 0: against Robert Sapolsky, who has been working on testosterone and its role in the brain and behavior for many decades now 
  Speaker 1: it is fair to say that testosterone has the net effect of making 
  Speaker 0: effort feel good 
  Speaker 1: or at least increasing the threshold at which effort feels 
  Speaker 0: bad or unsustainable. And 
  Speaker 1: it does that by way of changing the activity or the threshold 
  Speaker 0: for activation of brain structures like the 
  Speaker 1: amygdala and other brain 
  Speaker 0: structures associated with anxiety. 
  Speaker 1: So the next time somebody says testosterone makes people aggressive, 
  Speaker 0: you can say ah no, actually, 
  Speaker 1: it's estrogen 
  Speaker 0: that makes people 
  Speaker 1: aggressive and animals 
  Speaker 0: aggressive for that matter. 
  Speaker 1: Now, of course it is the case that because males 
  Speaker 0: have ([Time 0:41:13](https://www.airr.io/quote/627faf6b3782e70d24114057))
- Speaker 1: or to bias states 
  Speaker 0: of mind and body 
  Speaker 1: toward those that will lead to aggression. Again, aggression is not like a switch on and 
  Speaker 0: off. It's a process that has a 
  Speaker 1: beginning, a middle and an end. Remember that hydraulic pressure that 
  Speaker 0: konrad Lorenz hypothesized? Well, 
  Speaker 1: think of 
  Speaker 0: testosterone as 
  Speaker 1: increasing the pressure toward an aggressive 
  Speaker 0: episode and then 
  Speaker 1: estrogen actually triggering 
  Speaker 0: that aggressive episode in the venture medial hypothalamus. So 
  Speaker 1: if somebody tells you that 
  Speaker 0: testosterone endogenous or 
  Speaker 1: exogenous makes people aggressive, 
  Speaker 0: tell them no testosterone 
  Speaker 1: tends to make people lean into effort. And if that effort involves being aggressive 
  Speaker 0: either 
  Speaker 1: reactively aggressive 
  Speaker 0: or proactively ([Time 1:08:34](https://www.airr.io/quote/627fb1de3782e70d24132f2d))
