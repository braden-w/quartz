## Highlights
- The Imperial Imperative Exa
  Summary:
  No civilization, anything that we know of, doesn't try to gain ground from its neighbours where it can. Absoluyalto ye wanted it an awful lot, and did very, terribly well for many centuries. One shouldn't forget that. A, i'd also say, by the waythat then again, it's is a very broad one,. but it's worth throwing out that i think self criticism should be taken seriously.

  Speaker 2
  Not just the scholars, it's also the armies, the armies, and they're looking to gain access and control over resources elsewhere market. And hence the imperial imperative exa to
  Speaker 1
  conquer, to band. Although that itself, of course, is a universal thing. I mean, o no civilization, anything that we know of, doesn't try to gain ground from its neighbours where it can. It wists an ability to go further faster. Um certainly gave an advantage in that regarddo
  Speaker 2
  some civilizations get a bit more excited by that kind of idea than others? Possible. Ispossible cause. You could say, i t western civilization because the technological innovation was more a efficient, yes, doing that kind of thing. Absoluyalto ye wanted it more too.
  Speaker 1
  Well, the ottomans wanted it an awful lot, and did very, terribly well for many centuries. One shouldn't forget that. A, as did others.

- What Does Slavery Teach You About Human Nature?
  Summary:
  There are two possibilitiesa one is it's what peop think they can do when god's not watching. Another is, it's what they can do if they think that god allows it really, really well, put anda the fact that they want to do this kind of subjugation. W that mean?

- Reparations are No Longer About a Wealth Transfer, and the Case Against Reparations
  Summary:
  Every contender for th democratic nomination for the presidency in 20 20 was willing to talk about the possibility of reparations. Some very eager that this country, america, goes through that entirely self destructive exercise. There is no way in which you could organize such a a wealth transfer on moral or practical reasons. America is filled with people who are em have the same skin colour as us and should not be made to pay money to people who have some connection. And then the country is also filled with ethnic minorities who have come after slavery, who would not be em due for any reimbursement, as it were.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  isn't. I mean, every contender for th democratic nomination for the the presidency in 20 20 was willing to talk about the possibility of reparations. Some very eager that this country, america, goes through that entirely self destructive exercise. I i say that there's a, there's a lot of promise of this. But if i could refine it out of one thing, i'd say this, a, it's no longer about a wealth transfer from one group of people who did something wrong to another group of people who were wronged. It would have been, it would have been, that could have been that 200 years ago. To day, it's not even the descendants of people who did something wrong giving money to people who were the descendants of people who were wronged. It's a wealth transfer from people who look like people who did a wrong thing in the past to another group of people who resemble people who were wronged. That's impossible to do. Im completely clear about this. There is no way in which you could organize such a a wealth transfer on moral or practical reasons. America is filled with people who are em have the same skin colour as us, for instance, who have no connection to the slave trade and should not be made to pay money to people who have some connection. And then the country is also filled with ethnic minorities who have come after slavery, who would not be em due for any reimbursement, as it were.

- Crime Statistics in American Cities
  Summary:
  If a white person is walking down a street in america and they see a group of young black men coming towards them, its late at night, and they cross the road. It's because they've made a calculus based not entirely on er unfounded beliefs that, given crime rates, it might be a group of people theydon't want to meetlate at night. That's an ugly fact, but as crime statistics in american cities are for American cities bear out, a it's not an entirely unreasonable one. If you're in a city like chicago, where the homicide rates shot up in the last two years, all beit has to be remembered mainly black, ond black
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Em, and id ad ad, i'd like to apply some short cuts to some of this. The following are, for instance, all em, let's take the e v v one that's most often, often cited. If if a white person is walking down a street in america and they see a group of young black men coming towards them, its late at night, and they cross the road, is it because of slavery? Is it because of institutional racism? No, it's because they've made a calculus based not entirely on er unfounded beliefs that, given crime rates, it's possible that this group of people might be a group of people theydon't want to meet late at night. That's an ugly fact, but as crime statistics in american cities are for american cities bear out, a it's not an entirely unreasonable one. It's not reasonable every time, obviously, obviously. But is it attributable to slavery at's a stretch a if you're in a city like chicago, where the homicide rates shot up in the last two years, all beit, again, as as always, has to be remembered mainly black, ond black gun violence and knife violence. Nevertheless, if youre in a city like chicago and you make that calculus i've just suggested, the cleched one a the street late at night, there are other factors other than a memory of slavery, the kiken. I'm and i'm afraid it's er. ([Time 0:25:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8247ae4f-fa59-4c9b-9304-ea5a93c77357))
- Is There Deep Institutional Racism Against African Americans That's Rooted in Slavery?
  Summary:
  obesity is the one clearest factor that's likely to lead to your iation if you also get the virus. Why did almost no public health information n america focus on obesity? 80 % of the people who ended up hospitalizes in America with coronovirus were abese. We locked the schools when there was no evidence that the coronovirus was deadly for children. We had massive evidence about obecity being a problem, and we never addressed it. It's actually because about fat shaming, as it were. And this new publication from the university, university of chicago, as it happens, which makes that claim explicit. Says, the reasons why people a e have views
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  ways. And the nearest next country is a long way down. That's new zealand, at 30 % of the population. So america's a long way ahead. Why during the chronoviris era, when we know that obesity is the one clearest factor that's likely to lead to your iation if you also get the virus, why did almost no public health information n america focus on obesity? 80 % of the people who ended up hospitalizes in america with coronovirus were abese. We locked the schools when there was no evidence that the coronovirus was deadly for children. We all wore cloth masks when there was very little evidence that this was much use in stopping the spread of the virus. We had massive evidence about obecity being a problem, and we never addressed it. Why is it just because we worried about fat people? No, it's actually because about fat shaming, as it were. It's also because, to a great extent, it's a ratial issue in america as well. And asha quoteed this new publication from the university, university of chicago, as it happens, which makes that claim explicit. Says, the reasons why people a e have views that are negative about a b city is because of racism and slavery. This is what everything is drawn back america. Anything you want to stop, you say it's because of races, amd, it's because of slavery. How about it's actually because, you mind, the hospital is getting clogged up. You mind people dying. You mind, i think minority is disproportionately dying, and you'd like to say something about it. Once again, as in everything in america, it's cut off by some poorly educated academic saying, it's tout slavery. So we're really not this requires a kind of form of brain surgery to perform it on a society, and probably one it's not possible without killing the patient. And its being done by people who wearing like mittens. ([Time 0:28:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a9c5065e-322f-4189-9e8a-21411ace2000))
- The case against “You have no right to talk about my experience“
  Summary:
  "I have the right to talk about whatever the hell i want, and no one's going to stop me or try to intimidate me," says Elex freeman. "You are from a privileged class of people that don't know what it's like to be a black man or woman in america", he adds. 'In that case, test fattat thats i think we need to define steel'
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And aso, you get to really listen to that feeling. And for ample, it allows a white guy like me, from another part of the world, coming from the former surve union, to go into a room with a few hundred african americans screaming about joe rogan using the en word, and i get to really listen. There's very different prospectives on that in the african american community, and it's fascinating to listen. So i don't get access to that by stort of excellent books and articles, r, and so on. You get that real raw emotion. And i'm just saying there's a few of those folks listening to this with that real, raw emotiono, and they one argument, they say, is, you douglas murray, and you elex freeman, don't have the right to talk about race and racism in america. It is our struggle. You are from a privileged class of people that don't don't know what it's like to be a black man or woman in america, walking down the street. Can you steal man? In that case,
  Speaker 1
  test fattat thats
  Speaker 2
  i think we need to define steel. Steel manningk,
  Speaker 1
  i know what les tis riting is. I really resent that form of argumentation. Sure, i really resent it. I have the right to talk about whatever the hell i want, and no one's going to stop me or try to intimidate me or tell me that i can't, simply because of my skin color. And i think that if i said to somebody else the other way round, it would be equally reprehensible if i said, shut up. You have no right to criticise anything that douglas murray says because you've not got my skin colour. Ok, it's not an exact comparison, but seriously, is that? Is that a reasonable form of argument? Ar you haven't been through everything i've been through in my life, therefore you can't comment. No, in that case, nobody can talk about any hin. We might as well pack up, go
  Speaker 2
  home and isolate ourselves. ([Time 0:31:49](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0a0be843-573c-48cb-a7b8-ae471748a143))
- The Lived Experience is Used to Hijack Conversation
  Summary:
  I'm reluctant to concede that there are groups of people who, by dint of their skin collar or anything else, get to dominate the microphone. I don't like the sound of nobody's experience is completely understandable by another human being. If you were sitting in a room with a hollocost survivor and somebody who'd never heard about the holicoust - one of those people should be heard more than the other. Thisi this is an unwinnable game. It can be correct in some circumstances. But not endlessly, not endlessly. We might physically interrupt them if they telling us an dortis with logic and reason. The idea that the lived experience has to try u
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  up. You have no right to criticise anything that douglas murray says because you've not got my skin colour. Ok, it's not an exact comparison, but seriously, is that? Is that a reasonable form of argument? Ar you haven't been through everything i've been through in my life, therefore you can't comment. No, in that case, nobody can talk about any hin. We might as well pack up, go
  Speaker 2
  home and isolate ourselves. Strong words, but can you try to steal me on the case? Not in this particular situation, but there's people that have lived through something, they can comment in a very specific way, like, for example, holcott's survivors. Yes, there is a sense in which may be a basic sense of civility when a holicost survivor is speaking about their experience of the holocost than a an intellectual from a very different part of the world is simply writing about a neon deo, politics. He world war too. Just should not interrupt the holcot survivor. We
  Speaker 1
  might physically interrupt them if they telling us an dortis with
  Speaker 2
  logic and reason, that the experience of the holicot survivor is somehow fundamentally has a deeper understanding of the humanity
  Speaker 1
  and the injustice. First of all, i again, when even deeper warters now. But in terms of wanting to listen to another person who has experienced something, yes, yes. But not endlessly, not endlessly. I mean, there are some people who've written about the, i the are people whove writen about the holocaust who didn't experience the holocaust, and have written about it better than people who did. It's not this, this, this idea that the lived experience, to use this terrible modern jargon, as if there's another type. This this this idea that the lived experience has to try umph over everything else, is not always correct. It can be correct in some circumstances. If you were sitting in a room with a hollocost survivor and somebody who'd never heard about the holicoust and wanted a kind of, you know, shoot out their views on it, yes, one of those people should be heard more than the other, obviously, sly, if there's somebody who's experienced raceisn first hand, and there's somebody else who has never experienced it, then obviously you'd want to hear from the person who has experienced it first hand. If that is the discussion under way. I don't think that it's the case, that that is endlessly the case. I'm also highly reluctant to concede that there are groups of people who, by dint of their skin collar or anything else, get to dominate the microphone. Of course, we're literally both speaking to microphones at the moment, so there's an irony to this. But let's skate over th what i mean is people saying, you don't have the right to speak. I have the right to take myke friend from you and speak because i know best. Fine, if you know best, we'll argue it out, and some one will win, long or short term. But the the er, the almost aggressive tone in which this is now levelled, i don't like the sound of nobody's experience is completely understandable by another human being. Nobody's. And what many people are asking us to do at the moment, us collect tively, is to fall for that thing. I think it was camille faster who said, at first, but i've adopted in recent years, is to say, you must spend an inordinate amount of your life trying to understand me personally, my lived experience, everything about me, you should dedicate your life to into. Do that. Simultaneously, you'll never understand me. This is not an attractive invitation. Thisi this is an unwinnable game.

- Do White People Experience Raceism?
  Summary:
  If you say disgusting things about black people in america in 20 22, you will be over. And the white people have to suck that up as if that's fine because there was racism in another direction in the past. It gets us into an endless cycle of competitive victimd am i saying that white people who have experienced violence have experienced historically anything like the violence that was perpetrated against black people Historically? Obviously not. But wou know, what kind of competition do we want to enter here? and is very, very important to reign now in America.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  If you say disgusting things about black people in america in 20 22, you will be over. You will be over. If you decide to talk about people's white tears, their white fem tears, their white gilt, their white privilege, their white rage and all these other pseudo pathologizing terms, you'll be just fine. You can be the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. You could lecture at yale university, absolutely fine. And the white people have to suck that up as if that's fine because there was racism in another direction in the past. So white people can have raceism as well. Does that mean that i think that i have a right, or other white people have a right, to dominate the discourse by talking about their feelings of having been the victim, victims of raceism? No, not particularly. Because what does that get us? It gets us into an endless cycle of competitive victimd am i saying that white people who have experienced violence have experienced historically anything like the violence that was perpetrated against black people in america historically? Obviously not. But wou know, what kind of competition do we want to enter here? And is very, very important to reign now in america, because there's one other thing i have to throw in there, which is, how do you work out the sincerity of the claim? How do you work out the sincerity of the claim being made? At one point in my in this latest book, i referr to is a very useful bit in in nature and the genealogy of morals.

- How Do You Know If the Pain Is Due to Racism?
  Summary:
  How do you know whether the pain is real? How do you know? I'm not saying you can never know, but it's hard. So when somebody says, i feel that my life hasn't gone that well, and it's because of something that was done to my ancestors 200 years ago, maybe they do feel that. Maybe they're right to feel that. And who does know? How can you work that out?"
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  One of them was the moment when nice uses ta phrase that i have now stolen for myself, appropriated. He might say, am wheream where? He refers to who who tear at wounds long since close. And then cry about the pain they feel. Now how do you know? How do you know whether the pain is real? How
  Speaker 2
  do you know? I'm
  Speaker 1
  not saying you can never know, but it's hard. So when somebody says, i feel that my life hasn't gone that well, and it's because of something that was done to my ancestors 200 years ago, maybe they do feel that. Maybe they're right to feel that. Maybe they're making it up. Maybe they're using it as their reason for failure in life. Maybe they're using it as their reason to not even try. Maybe they're using it as their reason to smoke weed all day. I don't know. And who does know? How can you work that out? And that's why i come back to this thing of who are we to constantly judge, in this society other people whom we don't know and attribute motives to them based on on racial or other characteristics?

- Are You Going to Be That Person Or a Different Person?
  Summary:
  Resentment is something that can cross absolutely every boundary. And e the problem about it isthit'sht. It has a potential to be endless, a you can do it your whole life. This is something which we can do something abouti not limitlessly but for instance, there are very good reasons some people in their lives might feel resentment.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And e the problem about it isthit'sht. It has a potential to be endless, a you can do it your whole life. And one of the ways i've sort of sort of found myself explainied i osay, it's also important to recognize that resentment is something that can cross absolutely every boundary. So for instance, it crosses all racial boundaries. Obviously, i go without saying more interesting as it crosses all class boundaries and socio economic boundaries. And if i wase to sort of simplify this thought, i would say, i guess that you and i and everybody watching knows, or has known somebody in their lives who has almost nothing in worldly terms, and is a generous person, a kindly person, a giving person, a a happy person, even a cheerful person. And i think wed probably have also, or many of us will have met people who seem to have everything, and who ware filled with resentment, filled with resentment somebody else has held them back from something. Their sister once did something tta she shouldn't. She got this, and i should have got that, and and on and on and on. It's a human trait. And what one of the things that suggests to me is that we therefore have a choice in our lives about this. This is something which we can do something abouti not limitlessly, but for instance, i mean, there are very good reasons thas some people in their lives might feel resentment. Let's say you're involved in a car crash and a friend fell asleep at the wheel, and that's why you are spending the rest of your life in a wheel chair. Tat's a pertinent example of this in american politics at the moment. Am, you would be justified in feeling resentment. And at some point you have to make a decision, which is, am i going to be that person or a different person? ([Time 0:45:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f014033e-c3c7-4b6b-aef6-da0689c0c6e8))

  Speaker 3
  you explain
  Speaker 2
  to this engineer what critical race theory is? Is it at a term that's definable as their tradition? Their
  Speaker 1
  history were as good about it were as bad about it. Is a it is a tradition. Is a history, as a school of thought. It started in the law a roughly the 90 seventies, in some of the american academy a it spilled out. It always aimed to be an activist, losopy. People deny that now, but as i cite in the war in the west, the foundational text say as much. It isn't. This is an activist, a a academic study. We're not just looking at the law. We seek to change the law. And it's spilt out into all the other disciplines. I think there's a reason for that, by the way. Wi. It happened at the time that the humanities and others in america were increasingly weak and didn't know what to do, and they needed more games to play, or new games to play. The

- Is Critical Race Theory a New Game to Play?
  Summary:
  It's because we were willing to forget the big questions more fonto big questions. Partly it's a result of hyper specialization in academia. And i think most people, anyone who's watching, who's been in a philosophy department anty else in recent years, will know that tendency. I saw this at the end of my friend roger scruwton's life when he er, he would occasionaly, he didn't get tenure at universities, but he would occasionally be flown in, even by his enemies, to teach courses in various universities in basics of philosophy. He would he wd, he would go in and teach for a simester, you know, hegel
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Isit in his observation, in yours? Iss, a recent development? It's happened the last few decades, for sure, and
  Speaker 1
  it sped up.
  Speaker 2
  It is cause wee got into the bottom of some of the biggest questions of history?
  Speaker 1
  No, it's because we were willing to forget the big questions
  Speaker 2
  more fonto big
  Speaker 1
  questionswell, en, no, partly itss, partlyi, no, i shold stress at partly sand it's, this is in theweeds. But partly it's a result of hyper specialization in academia. Am you know, if you, if you said you'd like to write your dissertation on hobbs, i don't know, er, if you wanted t, if you something central to can's thought, or hegel, or somethingthing that's not popular, thats whats popular is to take somebody weigh down the line from that, because the's feeling that that's all been done. So you take something way, way, way down the line from that that's much less important. And tanyou sort of play with that. And i think most people, anyone who's watching, who's been in a philosophy department anty else in recent years, will know that tendency. By the way, there's a very practical consequence of this. I saw this at the end of my friend roger scruwton's life when he er, he would occasionaly, he didn't get tenure at universities, but he would occasionally be flown in, even by his enemies, to teach courses in various universities in basics of philosophy, because there was no one in the department able to do it.

So that had already happened, and people were searching for new games to play. And the critical race theory stuff forced its way, in partly im the way that all this that's now known as anti raceism, does whic in a sort of bullying tone of saying, if you don't follow this, i same way that all the things that are called studies. I think everything called studies in the humanities should be shut down because of the activist. It's an eliment tha all activis gay studies and queer studies, er er. Nothing good has ever come from it. Nothing good to

  push back, is it? Is it obvious that vism is a sign of a flaw in a discipline. So
  Speaker 1
  isn't it a sign of the death of the discipline? It's a sign that discipline is over. But
  Speaker 2
  isn't it a good goal to have, for discipline to enact change, positive change, in the world? Or is that too? Is that that's for politicians to do with the findings
  Speaker 1
  of science? I mean, no, why ceat an ideology and then set out to find disciplines that are weakly put together to try to back up your political ideology? So
  Speaker 2
  ideology should not be part of

  Speaker 1
  Anyone could do it. You could decide to go in and be wildly right wing about something, and only do things that prove your right wing ideas. Be fantastically anti academic fantastically, and science vantata. It's an absurd way to mix up activism and and and academia.

I mean, i think it would be such a vicious way to try to demoralize a group of people and to tell them that the things they would be able to a even their lives, are much lessened because they should spend significant portions of their lives trying to atone for something they didn't do?

  Caseis,
  Speaker 1
  look at this by this stage, ok, how many was madam armlet? Wel how many just messy, big, bloody, eggy piles have the marxists created by now? And country after country, theyare always next time they are going to produce the great omelet. But they never have, and they never will, because the whole thing is rotten from the start. But let me just also say one thing, because, of course, mark isn't as nice as he sounds. Nd, that's one of the things thati try to highlight in the book is, if we're going to do this reductive thing of people in history and saying whell they had views that were of their time, and we must therefore condemn them for them, say, fine, let's do the same thing with marks. And there are things i quote in this book for mark's letters, not least letters to engles. And indeed, in his published writings, in part piece he was writing for the american press in the eight in fifties, the way, he has horrible views on slavery and and and er colonialism and much more. But the main thing is only the horrible things he says about black people and the con use of the nd word. In fact, when i was doing the udea book for the walnwets, i had to decide will i read out the quotes from marks or not. If i had read them out, i'd have been cancelled, because peoplewould have just said, you've been using the end word so much in this passage, and you know this. And i slightly thought doing it, so that i could say i was only quoting marks to try to hit the point home. In the end, of course, i was sensible, and as i did not do but mark's letters are disgusting on these terms. Since i highlighted this in this book, and some of the media have picked it up a and er and have popularized this, i'm trying to put into the system, which is, if you're going to accuse churchill of racism, ou're gon to accuse, accuse jefferson of racism, washington of racism. And someone what about marks? The two things that mariss have said since this came out has been, first of all, why are you saying this about marks? He was a man of his time, like everyone else. And second thing they say is, we don't go to marks for his horrible, abhorrent views on race. They're talking about mixed race people as guerillas and so on. We don't go to him for that. We go to him for his economic theories. I say, ok, well, we don't go to thomas jefferson for his views on slaves. We don't go to churchill for his the precise language he used that points in the 19 tens about indians, or his health advice, or his health advice. Wesh, i do get in for that. But
  Speaker 3
  that explains so much. Buthaware
  Speaker 1
  some standards on thisand s why i that's why 'm very suspicious of the fact that the people don't do this with marks, because i think what they're trying, what some people are trying to do, and this isn't, this may sound conspiratorial, but i really don't think it is.

  Canettis very good on that, crowd some power em and eric hoffer, who is a sort of self taught amazing em not teought, a didactic writer, the true believer and so on, he was extremely good on that. But the reason i mentioned the two things now, i mean, we should have realized that the two mares of the twentieth century, fashism and communism, that we we should know how they came about. And we're interested in learning how one of them came about, fashism. And we know some of the lessons, like, don't treat other people as less than you because of their race. That's one lesson. But when we've, we've done some good at learning that. But the second one, not to do communism. Again, not to do socialism. I think we're way away from knowing cause we don't know how it happened.

  an appealing senseok? Every ideology has an appealing narrative behind it that sells the ideology. So for socialism, for communism, that there's a it seems unfair that the working class does all this work and gets only a fraction of the output. It just seems unfair. So you do get a fraction of the output, yes. And so it seems to be more fair if we increase that, if the workers own a all the value of their output. And, well, to things that are more fair seems to be a good thing. Id
  Speaker 1
  say, well, yet, i ness is is i like fairness as e no, i much prefer fairness because it's a much easier thing to try to work out. It's quite amorphos itself as a concerpt, but everyone can recognize it. So, for instance,

  then again, this kind of war against the west genius has actually makes you more likely, or no, to get cancelled. So if you look at the genius of thomas jefferson or,

A, i discovered that they could contain anything. And also, people didn't know what you were reading. I remember, at far too young an age, i read the daws of perception of huxley. Am and e, i didn't make head or tail of it, probably, but i knew that it was about something really interesting and dangerous. And i thought constantly, when i read poetry or read history. And thing, i was constantly am thrilled and wanted to know more. And, and if you want to become a writer, you have to be a reader. A, you have to read the best stuff.

  i remember that the first bookh absolutely through me was the lord of the flies, william golding, which used to be a signed text. And ever ones a bit snotty about because it's so popular.

You know, this was the first book i read where that's not the case, the world turns out differently. And i remember, for days afterwards, i was just in a state of shock. I i couldn't believe what i'd just discovered, and partly because i sowr intuited it must be true. And of course, that is not to say that the low th fly ha lots of scholarship on what children do in the situation of being on the island, when they do congregate and anyhow.
