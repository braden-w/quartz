## Highlights
- Speaker 1: money, but I think what's more important is just a natural evolutionary process whereby people choose all kinds of random things as money, bananas, maybe even, but then the people who end up making these bad choices 
  Speaker 0: don't end up with any 
  Speaker 1: wealth left, whereas the people who store them on their 
  Speaker 0: wealth in the things that 
  Speaker 1: are hard to make, end up acquiring, end up maintaining their wealth 
  Speaker 0: and maybe even increasing it over 
  Speaker 1: Time. And of course this culminated in the 19th century, in the end of the 19th century by the basically the entire planet being on a gold standard, what 
  Speaker 0: is the gold standard? 
  Speaker 1: The gold standard is basically when money is gold or 
  Speaker 0: at least government 
  Speaker 1: currencies backed by gold, but the reason 
  Speaker 0: gold became 
  Speaker 1: money and not copper, not nickel, not ([Time 0:20:24](https://www.airr.io/quote/628256d03782e70d24f943fa))
- Speaker 1: of years, humans have been digging for gold, they dig it out of the ground, they refine it and then they put it in a jewelry or a coin and then it just stays there um it gets melted down into new other forms, You know, the jewelry gets turned into 
  Speaker 0: coins or coins get 
  Speaker 1: turned into bars, 
  Speaker 0: but 
  Speaker 1: it's um it's just stockpiles that are accumulating. On the other hand. Um Every year we get better at our technology of looking for gold. You know, there's more people all over the world, the population increases, the technology 
  Speaker 0: improves. So we 
  Speaker 1: keep finding more and more gold and we keep making the stockpiles 
  Speaker 0: bigger. However, 
  Speaker 1: because we're constantly adding to a stockpile that is not being devalued, 
  Speaker 0: sorry, that is not being 
  Speaker 1: consumed because there's no way of consuming gold. You can't 
  Speaker 0: eat it, you can't 
  Speaker 1: burn it, you 
  Speaker 0: can't, it ([Time 0:21:39](https://www.airr.io/quote/628256dd3782e70d24f94bb0))
- Speaker 1: our problems caused 
  Speaker 0: by various 
  Speaker 1: random things, but don't worry, 
  Speaker 0: we're gonna be going back on the 
  Speaker 1: Gold standard 20 years later after they went off the gold standard, 
  Speaker 0: they come up with this 
  Speaker 1: justification for why, Oh, actually the gold standard was 
  Speaker 0: bad. And, 
  Speaker 1: and, and this is the really pernicious thing about it is the 
  Speaker 0: problems that were caused 
  Speaker 1: by us going off the gold standard 
  Speaker 0: where 
  Speaker 1: caused by the gold 
  Speaker 0: standard and we're 
  Speaker 1: going to fix them by 
  Speaker 0: going off the gold 
  Speaker 1: standard even more just 
  Speaker 0: because government is lying and it's shady and it does, these kinds of things doesn't mean kensi 
  Speaker 1: and economics is 
  Speaker 0: wrong. So just because I wanted to separate a few things you said, um, it could very well be very wrong and they could indeed be hucksters, all of these 
  Speaker 1: colorful, such 
  Speaker 0: colorful language. ([Time 0:56:35](https://www.airr.io/quote/62825a123782e70d24fbc5bc))
- is the inability to trade as opposed to being a forcing function for trade. It become a forcing function for conflict in cyberspace and potentially hot war. Yes, this is the scary part of it. And this is basically how World War Two happened, you know, because there's an old historian who used to say when um, I think his name is Autumn Allora and I quote him in the Bitcoin standard, if goods don't cross borders, then bombs will, if people trade with one another, they have an incentive for each other's Well being and then they have less of an incentive to fight. And it was the death of global trade in the 1930s because of the failure of the fiat system that brought about the rise of the populism, the on the rise of all those ([Time 2:28:33](https://www.airr.io/quote/628260a93782e70d24004b4b))
- ever invented. And the reason for that comes from two properties that this network has. The first one is that the currency is the hardest money ever invented is the money who supply is the most resistant to inflation. It's the first monetary asset that we've ever invented that is guaranteed to be fixed in its supply. That cannot be increased beyond a certain number. So there's only ever going to be 20 one million Bitcoins and that's that's a that's a qualitative leap forward in our technologies of money. All of our money's leak essentially because people can always make more and more and more of them. You know, the best money is the one that leaks the least, which is gold because It only leaks one and a half percent. In other words, your share of ([Time 2:34:55](https://www.airr.io/quote/628260a93782e70d24004b50))

Bitcoin is currently at around ([Time 2:35:04](https://www.airr.io/quote/6282627d3782e70d2401aa21))

So it's the first money that we've ever had that goes to zero in terms of terminal supply, so There will never be more than 21 million Bitcoin and I think that's a huge deal because you ([Time 2:35:15](https://www.airr.io/quote/6282627d3782e70d2401aa23))
- that they can fall victim to the same um corrupting forces the governments of all victims to share and for people who don't know. Yeah, hard fork is a the reverse incompatible change to uh, into the underlying function of a Cryptocurrency. Of course there is hard forks of uh, Bitcoin as well, I'm sure all of which you love dearly. Anyway, but that doesn't that doesn't matter. The original Bitcoin for the most part has not undergone any changes. And that's one of the I mean it has undergone changes but none, none in the important parameters of the network. So another criticism is ([Time 2:54:38](https://www.airr.io/quote/62826cfe3782e70d24092ae9))
