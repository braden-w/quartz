## Highlights
- Speaker 0: this letter, congratulating 
  Speaker 1: me for 
  Speaker 0: receiving something called the Hager Scholars 
  Speaker 1: Award and 
  Speaker 0: this letter explained that the award would take the place in my 
  Speaker 1: financial aid package of my student loan and, and here's what it said, this 
  Speaker 0: is an interest 
  Speaker 1: free loan with a 
  Speaker 0: moral obligation 
  Speaker 1: to repay. So, you know, at the time I 
  Speaker 0: was like, what is that? I don't know what this is. I showed it to my mom. She's like, yeah, it's just a grant. You're fine. 
  Speaker 1: Just take the money. 
  Speaker 0: But you know, um I graduated, I went to graduate school, I became 
  Speaker 1: a professor. I paid off all my actual 
  Speaker 0: student loans 
  Speaker 1: and when I had done so I thought to myself, oh wait, I'm not done 
  Speaker 0: yet. There's that 
  Speaker 1: Hagar ([Time 0:00:35](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e74d3782e70d241f06e9))
- Speaker 1: of money 
  Speaker 0: and it goes something like 
  Speaker 1: this in 
  Speaker 0: the beginning before there was money. Um If I had something that you needed, 
  Speaker 1: I would approach you 
  Speaker 0: with that thing and see if you had anything that I needed. So if you wanted some fish and you needed some acorns and I had them, I could approach you with those acorns and we could basically barter on the spot, figuring out how many acorns equals how many fish. The problem with barter is, it really does depend on us, each meeting each other's needs in that moment. And so the origin story of money that we have is that humans invented money essentially to be a mediator in these sorts of exchanges. In other words, if you, for example, had acorns, but I didn't actually want acorns. I wanted ([Time 0:03:43](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e74d3782e70d241f06eb))
- Speaker 0: kind of marks that relationship. It signifies to everyone around us that we have these ties of enduring obligation 
  Speaker 1: and responsibility. So in other words, it's not about a transaction, at least not in an immediate sense, it's about a transaction that perhaps unfolds over time. More to do with obligation. My son is marrying your daughter. 
  Speaker 0: I'm giving you this precious necklace that I have and my expectation is over the next 20 years, our families are going 
  Speaker 1: to help one 
  Speaker 0: another in all kinds of ways. 
  Speaker 1: That's right. It's, it's 
  Speaker 0: really a memory device to indicate an ongoing enduring relationship. An ongoing set of obligations. And 
  Speaker 1: is some of this 
  Speaker 0: connected with the more basic idea if you will of just gift ([Time 0:06:35](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e74d3782e70d241f06f1))

  Speaker 1: is some of this 
  Speaker 0: connected with the more basic idea if you will of just gift giving when you think about gifts, part of what we're doing when I'm giving you a gift. And presumably this is 
  Speaker 1: true for people all 
  Speaker 0: over the world in different cultures. The gift is 
  Speaker 1: partly my telling 
  Speaker 0: you hear something nice 
  Speaker 1: for you. But it also binds us in some kind of relationship that says down the line, you know, ([Time 0:06:51](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e74d3782e70d241f0727))
- Speaker 1: written records based on writing 
  Speaker 0: this, This isn't a market the way that we 
  Speaker 1: traditionally understand 
  Speaker 0: markets, right? It's not 
  Speaker 1: sort of the idea that people come 
  Speaker 0: together in a place and exchange goods either 
  Speaker 1: by barter or buy money. 
  Speaker 0: This is much more a kind of hierarchical 
  Speaker 1: system of 
  Speaker 0: organization 
  Speaker 1: to 
  Speaker 0: essentially allow 
  Speaker 1: for the creation of these larger scale 
  Speaker 0: societies. 
  Speaker 1: So you've talked about this idea of centralized 
  Speaker 0: administration 
  Speaker 1: and in some ways this brings us 
  Speaker 0: to another aspect of our story. 
  Speaker 1: We've talked a little bit about the idea of gift giving and 
  Speaker 0: mutual obligations. We've 
  Speaker 1: talked about the idea of receipts and record keeping and essentially, 
  Speaker 0: you know, basic contracts 
  Speaker 1: that sort of bind us to one another over time. 
  Speaker 0: But but talk 
  Speaker 1: also about this idea of the central 
  Speaker 0: administration of these systems ([Time 0:11:11](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e74d3782e70d241f0737))
- Speaker 1: Hamilton played in establishing our banking system. 
  Speaker 0: The figure on the 
  Speaker 1: 10 currently is 
  Speaker 0: alexander Hamilton's and then we thought maybe we want to 
  Speaker 1: keep him. So bill and the group decides that instead of redesigning the $10 bill, They should update the 20 
  Speaker 0: Since the 20 is a more 
  Speaker 1: ubiquitous bank note. It's the 
  Speaker 0: one that comes out of all the a. 
  Speaker 1: T. M's. Um, 
  Speaker 0: it's much more common 
  Speaker 1: in, in people's daily 
  Speaker 0: Transactions than the 10. 
  Speaker 1: The image of Andrew Jackson, the 7th president of the United States has been on the $20 bill since 1928. Jackson's tenure was marked by the signing of the indian removal act, which resulted in the deaths of thousands of indigenous people. Bill and other members of the group in Washington felt a woman should take Jackson's place. They ([Time 0:21:36](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e74d3782e70d241f0725))
- Speaker 0: doing nothing. 
  Speaker 1: So 
  Speaker 0: I'm wondering if this is connected to some very interesting 
  Speaker 1: phenomena that we 
  Speaker 0: see which is that even after coming up with this remarkable 
  Speaker 1: invention, money, we've also come up with lots of 
  Speaker 0: ways to make money 
  Speaker 1: inefficient and difficult 
  Speaker 0: to use. So we give our friends gift cards to restaurants that limit in 
  Speaker 1: some ways, how they can 
  Speaker 0: use the money in some ways it would be easier 
  Speaker 1: just to give them cash 
  Speaker 0: and they could use it at the restaurant or not use it at the restaurant. What do these inefficient forms of money. Tell us about the role that money plays in personal relationships. I love this kind of stuff because it really shows you that money is never purely fungible, right? We're continuously putting boundaries around different pots of money. ([Time 0:28:35](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e7ab3782e70d241f56a9))

I love this kind of stuff because it really shows you that money is never purely fungible, right? We're continuously putting boundaries around different pots of money. And those boundaries are often moral boundaries. They signify a moral or ethical 
  Speaker 1: or relational stance 
  Speaker 0: that we want to take 
  Speaker 1: With respect to one 
  Speaker 0: another and this kind of of earmarking of money for special purposes, this kind of sequestering of some money, taking it out of circulation and keeping it in a special place for only 
  Speaker 1: a special ([Time 0:28:56](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e7b13782e70d241f5bbf))
- Speaker 1: things as jobs put a dollar figure on them or should some things exist outside the sphere of money. This is kind of a 
  Speaker 0: paradox of of, 
  Speaker 1: you know, modern subjects in in contemporary 
  Speaker 0: Western societies 
  Speaker 1: is that, you 
  Speaker 0: know, we think of ourselves as individuals 
  Speaker 1: First and members of relationships. 2nd, even though of course it's only through relationships that we get formed, right. I wouldn't exist if it were not for a 
  Speaker 0: relationship between my 
  Speaker 1: parents and I wouldn't be able to be speaking to you now if there weren't 
  Speaker 0: a network of folks around 
  Speaker 1: me, um, who 
  Speaker 0: taught me language, right? 
  Speaker 1: Who taught me how to 
  Speaker 0: be in the world and how to be 
  Speaker 1: a person that makes connections. 
  Speaker 0: And yet 
  Speaker 1: because we have this 
  Speaker 0: kind of ideology 
  Speaker 1: that we are each a new person, we each 
  Speaker 0: stand alone. 
  Speaker 1: We are our 
  Speaker 0: own autonomous ([Time 0:30:30](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e7d73782e70d241f7674))
- Speaker 1: Bill. I understand that you have a somewhat unusual living arrangement. And I'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit about it, then talk 
  Speaker 0: about some of the 
  Speaker 1: relationships that are embedded in your housing. 
  Speaker 0: Sure, 
  Speaker 1: Okay. Disclaimer, I am not a hippie and we are not a tribe, but I live with my partner 
  Speaker 0: and another married 
  Speaker 1: Couple. There are four of us together 
  Speaker 0: and the other couple has a young son 
  Speaker 1: and before 
  Speaker 0: their child was 
  Speaker 1: born um we became very 
  Speaker 0: close friends, we were 
  Speaker 1: living a few blocks away from each 
  Speaker 0: other, we ended 
  Speaker 1: up kind of eating at each other's 
  Speaker 0: houses every night, you know, a kind of close close 
  Speaker 1: little network of 
  Speaker 0: friends 
  Speaker 1: and I live in southern California, 
  Speaker 0: it's very expensive. We are for 
  Speaker 1: Professionals, but even with four 
  Speaker 0: professional ([Time 0:31:34](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e7ef3782e70d241f8939))
- Speaker 0: that and and operating as a kind of larger economic 
  Speaker 1: unit. And yeah, 
  Speaker 0: I mean, we really are kind of living in a sort of alternative economic 
  Speaker 1: arrangement that's 
  Speaker 0: based on these, you know, close, I think you could almost call them kin relationships um that we've established together. And in many ways like the house is the symbol of those relationships, right? I mean, the house is the house is our shell valuable, right? It's the thing that that signifies that connection. 
  Speaker 1: So what's so 
  Speaker 0: interesting about this arrangement is in some 
  Speaker 1: ways it speaks to what you said some time ago about the difference 
  Speaker 0: between the 
  Speaker 1: way economists want to 
  Speaker 0: think about transactions and the way 
  Speaker 1: that you're describing them, 
  Speaker 0: which is that 
  Speaker 1: if you want to live in a world where the transaction is over, you 
  Speaker 0: know, you give me something, I 
  Speaker 1: pay you something, ([Time 0:33:36](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e81d3782e70d241faedf))

  Speaker 0: which is that 
  Speaker 1: if you want to live in a world where the transaction is over, you 
  Speaker 0: know, you give me something, I 
  Speaker 1: pay you something, we shake 
  Speaker 0: hands. We never 
  Speaker 1: see each other again. That is not the system 
  Speaker 0: that you have set up for your housing, right? Because the 
  Speaker 1: system you have set up is a system in some ways of 
  Speaker 0: indefinite debts 
  Speaker 1: and obligations that are constantly being created and repaid. You're constantly engaged 
  Speaker 0: in 
  Speaker 1: gift giving, gift taking, but that binds you in some ways 
  Speaker 0: in a web of 
  Speaker 1: obligations that I'm 
  Speaker 0: hearing you say 
  Speaker 1: in some ways has worked very well for you. It's worked very well. You know, we actually had 
  Speaker 0: an anthropologist want to come live with us. I said 
  Speaker 1: no, 
  Speaker 0: she's 
  Speaker 1: like, I 
  Speaker 0: would ([Time 0:34:10](https://www.airr.io/quote/6283e82b3782e70d241fb711))
