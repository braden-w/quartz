## Highlights
- Marxism - A Critical Analysis of Capitalism
  Summary:
  It's a hundred and forty years since marks died. His ideas have become major types of thinking in every country on the earth. The marxian ideas eracted with very different cultural histories, religious histories and economic conditions. And therefore, marxism, as a kind of first flush definition, is the totality of all these very different ways of coming to terms with it.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Well,
  Speaker 1
  the simplest way to begin a definition would be to say it's the tradition that takes its founding inspiration from the works of karl marx a. But because these ideas that he put forward spread as fast as they did and as globally as they did, literally, it's a hundred and forty years since marks died. And in that time, his ideas have become major types of thinking in every country on the earth. Ah, if you know much about the great ideas of human tory, ah, that's an extraordinary spread in an extraordinarily short period of historical time. And what that has meant, that speed of spread and that geographic diversity, is that the marxian ideas eracted with very different cultural histories, religious histories and economic conditions. So the end result was that the ideas were interpreted differently in different places at different times. And therefore, marxism, as a kind of first flush definition, is the totality of all these very different ways of coming to terms with it. For the first roughly forty, 50 years, marxism was te tradition of thinking critically about capitalism. Marks himself, that's all he really did. He never wrote a book about communism. He never wrote a book really about socialism either. His comments were occasional, fragmentary, dispersed. What he was really interested in was a critical analysis of capitalism. And that's what marxism was more or less in its first forty or 50 years.

  the only qualification
  Speaker 1
  of what i just said was something that happened in paris for a few weeks in 18 71, there was a collapse of the french government consequent upon losing a war to bismarck's germany. ([Time 0:07:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cd45289b-a90d-4366-9b37-3f7e74bae378))
- Marxism is a Critique of Capitalism and we can do better
  Summary:
  Much of marxism remains chiefly the critique of capitalism, but another part of it becomes a set. They differ from one to the other, a set of notions of what an alternative, post capitalist society ought to look like. And there's lots of disagreement about it, lots of confusion. That would be the framework in which i would answer. Its basic idea, if you had to have one, is that human society can do better than capitalism and it ought to try. Then we can start to talk about what we mean by capitalism.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yes, the com e story. Anyway, the importance in terms of marxism is that now, this seizure of power by a group of marxists, that is, a group of people inspired by marks, developing what you might call a russian even though there were differences among the sians too, but a russian interpretation. This now has to be transformed from a critique of capitalism into a plan, at least, what are you going to do in the soviet union? And a lot of this was then trial and error. Mark never laid any of this out. Probably wouldn't have been all that relevant if he had, cause it was 50 years earlier, in another country, et cetera.
  Speaker 6
  So what
  Speaker 1
  begins to happen, and you can see how this happens then, more later, in china and cuba and tetnam and korea and so on, is that you have kind of a bifercation. Much of marxism remains, chiefly the critique of capitalism, but another part of it becomes
  Speaker 5
  a
  Speaker 1
  set, and they differ from one to the other, a set of notions of
  Speaker 3
  what an alternative, post
  Speaker 1
  capitalist society ought
  Speaker 5
  to look like, how it ought to work.
  Speaker 1
  And there's lots of disagreement about it, lots
  Speaker 3
  of confusion.
  Speaker 1
  Ah, and i would say that that's still where it is. You have a tradition now that has these two major wings, critique capitalism, notion of the alternative, and then a variety of each of those. And that would be the framework in which i would answer. That's what marxism is about. Its basic idea, if you had to have one,
  Speaker 3
  is that human society
  Speaker 7
  can do better than capitalism, and it ought to try. And
  Speaker 2
  then we can start to talk about what we mean by capitalism. Fine, so we'll look at the critique of capitalism on one side, but maybe stepping back, what do you think marks would say ([Time 0:13:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2de666e7-a95c-48d2-a7de-1d94c639b55c))
- Ignorance is not a mental problem, it's the taboo shut it down
  Summary:
  The taboo against marxism kicks in after world war too. i, for example, have had to spend a ridiculous amount of my time simply explaining to american audiences that the marks ism they take as canonical is that old soviet marxism. It was a kind of and the irony is particularly here in the united states,. where the taboo againstmarxism kick in after World War 2.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It was a kind of and
  Speaker 5
  the irony is particularly
  Speaker 1
  here in the united states, where the taboo against marxism kicks in after world war too, is so total
  Speaker 7
  in this country that
  Speaker 1
  i, for example, through most of my adult life, have had to spend a ridiculous amount of my time simply explaining to american
  Speaker 7
  audiences that
  Speaker 1
  the marks ism they take as canonical is that old soviet marxism, which wasn't the canon before 19 17 and hasn't been since at least the 19 sixties. But they don't know. It's not that they're stupid, and it's not that they're ignorant.
  Speaker 6
  It's that, well,
  Speaker 1
  i ignorance maybe, but is not a mental problem, t it's the taboo shut it down. And so all of the reopening that in a way, recaptures what went before and develops it in new directions, they just don't know.
  Speaker 2
  Nevertheless, it's a serious attempt at making the implicit ideas explicit. The the russians, the the soviets, at the beginning of the twentieth century, made a serious attempt at saying, ok, beyond the critique of capitalism, how do we actually build a system o ries and so in that sense, not at high level, but at a detail level. It's interesting to look at those particular schools. May be right.
  Speaker 1
  Because, for example, just to take your point one step further, you really cannot understand the cuban revolution, the chinese revolution via namiz and the others, because each of them is a kind of response, let's call it, to the way the soviets did it. Are you going to do it that way? Well, yes and no, is the answer.
  Speaker 3
  This we will do that way, but
  Speaker 1
  that we're not going to do. ([Time 0:19:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8fc114b1-c7a5-4eaf-8bec-8dac78b15021))
- Marc declared Socialism to be where the people capture the state
  Summary:
  socialism is when the working class capture the state, either by reform or revolution. And then uses its power over the state to make the transition from capitalism to the better thing we're going toward. In other words, lenin who's crystal clear before he he doen't live very long. He dies in 23. By that time, he has his brain trouble. Ah, with stalen, lenin dies, and there's the fight between stalen and trotsky. Trotky loses the fight. Stalen is now alone in power, and does all of the things he is famous or infamous for. We have captured the state, but we don't have socialism. We
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Now we have the state. And socialism is when the working class
  Speaker 3
  capture the state, either
  Speaker 1
  by reform or revolution, and
  Speaker 3
  then uses its power over the state to
  Speaker 1
  make the transition from capitalism to the better thing we're going toward. And again, make a long story short in the interests of time, what
  Speaker 3
  happens, which
  Speaker 1
  is unusual in human history, is
  Speaker 3
  that the means becomes
  Speaker 5
  the end. In
  Speaker 1
  other words, lenin, who's crystal clear before he he doen't live very long. He dies in 23. So he's only in power from 17 en to 22. By that
  Speaker 6
  time, he has his brain trouble. And that tn 23. By thenot at aged 20, threeyes. Atoran, 19 23. He's only there for for five years.
  Speaker 1
  A, he's very clear. Even says, and i've done work on i've published so i mayot know the stuff, he says in a famous speech, let's not fool ourselves. We have captured the state, but we don't have socialism. We have to create that. We have to move towards
  Speaker 7
  that.
  Speaker 1
  Ah, with stalen, lenin dies, and there's the fight between stalen and trotsky. Trotky loses the fight. He is exiled. He goes to mexico. Stalen is now alone in power, and does all the things he is famous or infamous for. Ah, and
  Speaker 3
  by the end of the twenties, stalen makes
  Speaker 1
  a decision. Imean not iis not that he makes it alone, but things have evolved in russia so that they do the following, they declare that they are socialism. In other words, socialism becomes when you capture the state, not when the state capture has enabled you to do x, y, z other things. No,
  Speaker 3
  no,
  Speaker 1
  the state itself,
  Speaker 3
  once you have it,
  Speaker 1
  is socialism. So when a socialist captures the state, that's socialism, exactly. And het, that's exactly right. ([Time 0:34:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/78a66be0-d684-4596-9c59-6a9a867c0386))
- Why they didn't succeed
  Summary:
  "I think i would have been like them if i had lived at their time, under their circumstaes. Not a critique of them, but it's a different way of understanding what's going on" "They tried very hard, by the wayhad i spent ten years of my life in ivy leak, 20 simesters, one after the other, no break." 'You still have to take that leap. What is beyond capitalism? Right? Maybe we should turn to that exp yes' "'We've already looked historically at several attemptswhen tou go beyond capitalism. How else can we go beyond capitism?' Let me push a little further," he says.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So that's,
  Speaker 2
  that's that has to do with a very specific set of implement as initiated by the sovi union. Has nothing to do with marks.
  Speaker 1
  How else can you do i don't think you can find, yes, anywhere in mark's writing
  Speaker 7
  anything about central plale or any other kind of planting. Again,
  Speaker 2
  fundamentally then a mark. Mark's work, it has to do with a with factories, with workers, with a bourgeoisie, wi and ante, the exploitation of the working classes. But you still have to take that leap. What
  Speaker 1
  is beyond capitalism? Right? Maybe we should turn to that exp yes. Oa,
  Speaker 6
  ok, yes.
  Speaker 2
  What?
  Speaker 4
  Ok. We've already looked historically at several attemptswhen tou go beyond capitalism. How
  Speaker 2
  else can we go beyond capitism?
  Speaker 1
  Let me push a little further. They didn't succeed, in my judgment as
  Speaker 7
  a marist. And
  Speaker 1
  i'm now going to tell you why they didn't succeed. Because they didn't understand as well as they coulder should have, what marxes was trying to do. I think i would have been like them if i had lived at their time, under their circumstaes. Not a critique of them, but
  Speaker 3
  it's a different way of understanding what's going on. So giveyou
  Speaker 1
  example. Most of my adult life i have taught marxian economics. I'm a professor of economics. I've been that all my life. I'm a graduate of american universities. As it happens, i'm a graduate of what in this country passes for its best universitiesother conversation you and i can have. So i went to harvard d then i went to stanford, and i finished at yale. I'm like a poster boy for a leat education. They tried very hard, by the wayhad
  Speaker 3
  i spent ten years of my life in ivy leak, 20
  Speaker 1
  simesters, one after the other, no break. ([Time 0:38:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/804ff4c6-5a69-4f90-bcf5-a15b78e9f596))
- Marxism not Mentioned in the Ivy League
  Summary:
  I spent ten years of my life in ivy leak, 20 simesters. 19 of them never mentioned a word about marxism. In the one semester i studied with him, he gave me plenty to read but nobody else. So that's really interesting. You've mentioned that in the past, and that makes you a very interesting figure to hold your ground intellect lly,. through this idea space where just peopled, don't really even talk about it. Perhaps I'm like a poster boy for a leat education.

  is, no critique of capitalism was offered to me, ever, with one, except one profess in

- Exploitation and the Class Struggle
  Summary:
  Exploitation exists if and when the surplus that's produced is taken and distributed by people other than those who duced. Slaves produce a surplus which the master gets. Serfs produce a surplusWhich the lord gets. Employees produce a surpluswhich the employer gets. It's very simple. These are exploitive class structures because one class produces a surplus, appropriated, distributed by another group of people not the ones who produced it.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  So
  Speaker 2
  what's can we just linger on the definition of exploitation? Yes, context
  Speaker 1
  easy becomes very easy.
  Speaker 3
  Exploitation exists if and when the
  Speaker 1
  surplus that's produced is taken and distributed by people other than those who duced. Slaves produce a surplus which the master gets. Serfs produce a surplus which the lord gets. Employees produce a surplus which the employer gets. It's very simple. These are exploitive class structures because one class produces a surplus, appropriated,
  Speaker 3
  distributed by
  Speaker 1
  another group of people, not the ones who produced it, which creates hostility, enmity,
  Speaker 3
  envy, anger, resentment and all the blems you
  Speaker 1
  can lump under the heading class struggle. I use a metaphor, simple metaphorical story. You have two children, let's assume,
  Speaker 3
  and you take em to central park a few blocks from here. It's a nice day, and
  Speaker 1
  the children are playing, and in comes one of those men witha ice am truck.
  Speaker 3
  Comes by, dinglingalingling. Your children see the ice cream, daddy, get me an ice cream. So
  Speaker 1
  you walk over, you take some money, and you get two ice cream cones, and you give em to one of the children. The other one begins to scream and yell and howl. Obviously, what's the issue. And you realize you've just made a terrible mistake. So you order the one you gave the two ice cream cones, to give one of those to your sister or your brother, or whatever it is. And that's how you solve the problem, until a psychologist comes along and says, you
  Speaker 5
  know, you
  Speaker 1
  didn't fix it by what you just did. You
  Speaker 7
  should never have done that in the first place. ([Time 0:46:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/88adf3bf-0575-423a-afba-c8ff3ebdc1b1))
- The problem is inequality and the misallocation of surplus
  Summary:
  A reallocation of resources creates bitterness and hapules. The government's reallya a very secondary matter to this corps question. If you make a revolution, and you do is remove the private exploiter and substitute a government official, without changing the relationship,. you're not getting the point of the marxism.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 7
  My
  Speaker 1
  response, so you understand, all of the efforts to deal with inequality in economic, political culture, these are all giving the ice cream comb back to the kid. You should, you should never do this in the first place. A reallocation of resources creates bitterness and hapules. Look at arth w this country is tearing itself apart now in a way that i have never seen in my life, and i've lived here all my life and i've worked here all my life. It's tearing itself apart. And it's tearing itself apart
  Speaker 5
  basically
  Speaker 1
  over the re division, the re distribution of wealth having
  Speaker 5
  so badly
  Speaker 1
  distributed in the first but
  Speaker 3
  that's all in marks. And notice, as i explain to you what is going on in this tension filled production
  Speaker 6
  seen in
  Speaker 1
  the office, the factory, the store, i don't have to say a word about the governmenti'm not interested in the government. The government's reallya a very secondary matter to
  Speaker 3
  this corps question. And here comes the big point.
  Speaker 5
  If you make a revolution, and
  Speaker 3
  you do
  Speaker 1
  is remove the private exploiter and
  Speaker 3
  substitute a government official, without changing the relationship, you,
  Speaker 1
  you
  Speaker 3
  can call yourself a marxist all day long, but you're not getting the point of the marxism. The point was not who the ter is, but the exploitation per se. You've got to change the organization of the workplace so there isn't
  Speaker 1
  a group that makes all the decisions and gets the surplus ves visivi, another one that produces it. If
  Speaker 3
  you do that, you will destroy the whole project. You will, not
  Speaker 1
  only will you not achieve what you set out to get, but
  Speaker 3
  you'll so misunderstand it that
  Speaker 1
  you the germans, again, have a phrase, isget sheef, it goes crooked. It doesn't go right? The project gets off the rails because it can't. It can't understand either what is objective should have been. And therefore, it
  Speaker 3
  doesn't understand how and why it's missing it's
  Speaker 1
  objective. It just knows that this is not what
  Speaker 7
  it
  Speaker 2
  had hoped for. ([Time 0:48:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/95a17b9d-0b85-45a9-a319-6e16bed16203))

- How Markets Are Exploititative
  Summary:
  markets are about how to handle shortage. And so if the demand is greater than the supply, ok, now you've got a problem. You can't satisfy all the demanders cause you dont hav enough supply. Now, how are you going to do it in a market? You allow people who have a lot of money to bid up the price of whatever short that solves your problem. As the price goes up, the poor people can't, they drop out. It goes to the people with the most money. Most human beings, confronted with this explanation of a market would turn against it, cause it contradicts their n judaic, islamic, all of em would say,
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  They're ready to lend it.
  Speaker 5
  Ok to
  Speaker 1
  should they lend itw we could say, in our society, we're going to run this the way professors in institutions like m i t work this. They write up a project, they send the project in to some government office where it is looked at gainst other projects. And this office in the government decides whe could have fund this one and that one, because they're more needed in our society. We are in greater need of solving this problem than that problem. And so we're going to lend money to people working on this problem more readily, or more money than we lend over here, because we're going to. But
  Speaker 3
  instead, what we do is, who can pay the highest interestry? Wo whal. You do it. Why? Why? What ethics would justify you do it? It's like a market in general. Something is in shortage. Markets
  Speaker 6
  are about how
  Speaker 1
  to handle shortage. That's one base way to understand it. And
  Speaker 3
  so if the demand is greater than the supply, which is all the word shortage means,
  Speaker 7
  has
  Speaker 1
  no other meaning. If the demand is greater than the supply, ok, now you've got a problem. You can't satisfy all the demanders cause you dont hav enough supply. You have a shortage, ok?
  Speaker 3
  Now,
  Speaker 1
  how are you going to do it
  Speaker 3
  in a market? You allow people who have a lot of money to
  Speaker 1
  bid up the price of whatever short that solves your problem, because as the price goes up, the poor people can't, they drop out. They can't buy the thing at the exalted price. So you've got a way of distributing the shortage. It
  Speaker 3
  goes to the people with the most money. At this point, most human beings, confronted with this explanation of a market would turn against it, cause
  Speaker 1
  it contradicts their n judaic,
  Speaker 3
  islamic, all of em would say, what you know that means? It means that a rich person can get the scarce milk and give it to their cat, while
  Speaker 1
  the poor person has no milk for their five children. There
  Speaker 3
  it is. Do
  Speaker 1
  you want a market? Why? ([Time 1:07:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4d5fd763-b55a-48d2-b62f-9e10d4e8f4a3))

In simple english, there's a good and bad side, if you like, to everything, and you won't understand it unless you accept that proposition and start looking for the good things that are the other side of the bad ones, and the bad things that are the other side of the good ones, et cetera.

- The Minimum Wage in the United States as a Failure of Capitalism
  Summary:
  The last time the minimum wage wat was raised in the united states, federal minimum wage, was in two thousand and nine. Over the last 12 years or so, whatever it isno, 12, 13 years, since then, we have had an increase in the price level in this country every year. And in the last year, eight and a half %. During that time that the prices went up, the minimum wage was never raised. What? This is a time of stock market boom, of growing inequa.

  don't and to day,

  Summary:
  In the last year, eight and a half %. during that time that the prices went up, the minimum wage was never raised. What? This is a time of stock market boom, of growing inequa. Long ago, capitalism could have overcome hunger, could have overcome disease. Could have, i mean, way beyond what we have now. But it didn't. And that's the worst moral condemnation ima how do you justify that when you could you didn't. The notion that the mass enjoyment of a rising standard of living is somehow built into capitalism is factually nuts.

  And in the last year, eight and a half %. During that time that the prices went up, the
  Speaker 1
  minimum wage was never raised.
  Speaker 5
  What?
  Speaker 3
  This is a time of stock market boom, of growing inequa. This is he si,
  Speaker 1
  the nerve of the defender of capitalists, who wants now to
  Speaker 5
  get credit
  Speaker 3
  for the improvement in the standard of life workers that was fought by every generation. You
  Speaker 1
  know, it takes your breath away. Its an argument wo
  Speaker 3
  but i'd take my hat off if i had one, because that is one of the only ways to justify this system. Long ago,
  Speaker 1
  let me get at the heart of it.
  Speaker 3
  Long ago, capitalism could have
  Speaker 1
  overcome hunger, could have overcome disease. Could have, i mean, way beyond what we have now.
  Speaker 3
  But it didn't.
  Speaker 1
  And that's the worst moral condemnation ima
  Speaker 3
  how do you justify
  Speaker 1
  that when you could
  Speaker 5
  you didn't. Look,
  Speaker 1
  let me get at it another way, cause thismay interest you. Anyway, the issue is not that capitalism isn't technologically dynamic. It is. And along the way, it has developed things that have helped people's lives get better, no question. But the notion that the the mass enjoyment of a rising standard of living is somehow built into capitalism is factually nuts. Andis
  Speaker 3
  such an outrageous
  Speaker 1
  and i can give you, ecause you do mat you'll understand it. ([Time 1:14:30](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0cc8ac88-83c2-4cf7-8562-f1fb58ce479a))

- Mass Transportation
  Summary:
  There is a way to make transportation more rational, and we've known it for decades. It could easily be done in this society. In fact, i once dida project that. I estimate it cost 30 billion dollars. That's less than we're sending to eukrane to do this,. To reconfigure it a public trane system where everywhere n this country, all the major metropal this country, overwhelmingly metropolitan, ari wfew airly.

  So tha, that anger rises up in those little ways now and bigger, antially,
  Speaker 3
  by the way. There's one more thing on
  Speaker 1
  the rationality, and this goes to elon musk
  Speaker 7
  if
  Speaker 3
  you're interested,
  Speaker 1
  forty nine thousand people were killed in automobile accidents this last year. The number was just released. Forty nine thousand. Automobiles are the single largest pollutent in the country. They use up an enormous amount of energy. They they use up enormous amount of resources.
  Speaker 7
  There
  Speaker 1
  is a way to make transportation more rational, and we've known it for decades. It's called mass transportation. It's
  Speaker 5
  a really beautifully
  Speaker 1
  maintained, crystal clear, clean, frequent system of busses, trains, street rock
  Speaker 3
  trolleys, vans.
  Speaker 1
  It could easily be done in this society. In fact, i once dida project that. I estimate it cost 30 billion dollars. That's less than we're sending to eukrane to do this, to reconfigure it
  Speaker 2
  a public trane system where everywhere n this country, all
  Speaker 1
  the major metropal this
  Speaker 6
  country, overwhelmingly metropolitan, ari wfew airly. Has to be more than 30 billion. But,
  Speaker 1
  but, well, it was a few years ago. Sherald e, you're saying it, but i'm using a lotf that's insane, right? It's not crazy, stute. It's a reasonable number. It riis.
  Speaker 2
  But there's a and, well,
  Speaker 1
  let me just finish the pointer. So
  Speaker 6
  i'm
  Speaker 3
  trying to be rational here. If
  Speaker 1
  we have a climate crisis, which everyone tells me we do, if it's got a lot to do with fossil fuels, which everybody tells me it has to do and and with the use of the fossil fuel, particularly for the automobile,
  Speaker 3
  then the solution to the problem would be mas transit.
  Speaker 1
  We don't. We're doing nothing to make that happen.
  Speaker 7
  Nothing. ([Time 1:36:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d4b2488c-42a9-4a8e-9fe1-c5fb546ae2e4))
