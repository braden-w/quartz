## Highlights
- Resistance is Future. You Need More Frequency
  Summary:
  The industry has done a lot to get more bits per herts, but the reality is that you need more spectrum. So five g's been designed to work across every spectrum - from the low frequency bands to the millimeter wave. "There's not so much we can rely on more bits per hurts. You just need more spectrum," he says.

  Great topic of conversation. So lit stalkot, when i meet with regulators across the globe, i tell thema, resistance is futile. I locate every spectrum to wireless. Every spectrum needs to be allocated to wireless. The reality is, when we start moving from c d m a to of t m a, we knew that thi this industry has done a lot to get more bits per herts, but the reality is, a the massive amount of improvements that is required in capacity and in speed, you need more spectrum. You know, there's, there's not so much we can rely on more bits per hurts. You just need more spectrum. And if you look, for example, what care or sinstitutugi era, they participate in different license and auctions. And every spectrum they accumulated from two g, or three g, or four g, all of that, you may be able to get one or two channel maxs of subsic which is the channels about a hundred mega herts or 200 mega herts, and that's it. So you we need more spectrum. So five g's been designed to work across every spectrum, from the low frequency bands, that's we call the sub six. But you needed more, you needed to go to the millimeter wave. So that's why five, five gees of technology that you can employ from 450 ([Time 0:14:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/37574dca-60cb-4fa2-a8bd-32e9f182ee4d))
- Design With Quality
  Summary:
  You have to design with quality, and there's a bar that's high. The engineer needs to work as one. Every cart needs to be there right when it leaves the station. Hard dead lines, no room for mistakes. No wonder our name has quality communications. Superstracal, but i love it.

  Speaker 1
  I'm, of course, very partial about it. 've ben this company for probably more than 26 years. But i argue that they're a couple of things that are ingredients for success. So we talk about tefacthat you have all those different technologies. They evolve at their own pace. And you have to be good and each one of them. And you need them to make them working together. So so you need to have an engineering organization that's wita incredible collaboration culture, because everybody has to be working. The train's going to leave the station. Every cart needs to be there right when it leaves the station. S to leave on time. Especially in the phone business, you can change christmas. You cannot change black friday. You cannot change all the selling season. So the phones are going to lounch on time. And every technologe needs to be there. The engineer needs to work as one. And we do have that aquocam. The other thing you have to have incredible a discipline because, a, you know, those are very complex systems. In one way, you have to design with quality. Ah, because in many cases we're going to be ramping production and even before we have the silican back. And you have to rely on unerssimulation models, and you have to rely on on the fact that you design a for commercial applications. That takes, that takes a while to t and a and beno has probably been the history of a semi conductor business at quacam. So,
  Speaker 2
  you mean, like the framework of how many people can use simulation salts, r and all that kind of stuff to build a thing with a hard dead line that you might not even get back from the manufacture, you're not allowed to any mistake. No
  Speaker 1
  wonder our name has quality communications. Oh, i never even thought about the part.
  Speaker 2
  Qualitys a quality, and there's a bar that's high, and you're not allowed to mess up. I mean, to me, as an engineer, that's exciting. Hard dead lines, a, no room for mistakes. I love it. Superstracal, but i love it. ([Time 0:30:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7e65c455-a243-4ba8-a5d9-8fbf3a3b378f))
- The Number One Use Case on a PC today is Communications
  Summary:
  The number one use case of personal computers its communications. In the telecom industry, we've been chasing this killer application of vido telephony for decades,. I remember a back then in the wire line a, even before the internet and ip i i s d nRemember those a t and t des phones with a little screen and sat you can do vidotelephony? We din' watc that in back to the future too. Then, there was, in many cases, designed for phones, and we said it in the beginning, connectivity and processing is going to virtually every industry. And as a result, quacum is really changing with it and expanding to a number of different

  Before i answer that question, let me just step back a little bit because, and i'm sure we, we can talk more about those things, but the the reality is quocum is changing a lot. And we use, i know we spend a lot of time talking about five g and smart phone and snapdragon, and i think that has been what had defined qualcume for many years. But the reality is even consistent with that five g conversation, which is a technology to connect everything. Quacom is also changing our technology. There was, in many cases, designed for phones, and we said it in the beginning, connectivity and processing is going to virtually every industry. And as a result, quacum is really changing with it and expanding to a number of different addressable markets. Some of those markets is is the pc. As you talk about it, the the conversions of mobo and pc. And the reason i'm excited about this because you see o things happening that bring this right front and centere when you think about the future technology. So what we learn with the pendemic is that the number one use case of personal computers its communications. Ah, it is interesting when you think about that, that's the number one use case on a pc to da is communications. It's actually funny, because in the er industry, aly al say, let me step back. In the telecom industry, we've been chasing this killer application of vido telephony for decades, right? I remember a back then in the wire line a, even before the internet and ip i i s d n remember those a t and t des phones with a little screen and sat you can do vido telephony. We din' watc that in back to the future too. ([Time 0:37:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/61b463e6-f47e-440d-a021-12f8f05f1bf5))
- Business Partnership is Really Done by People
  Summary:
  The company is growing in a number of different directions, all at the same time. And so it did got busier. Part of this is because i'm spending a lot of time understanding the new industries were going in and building relationships. At the end of the day, business partnership is really done by people. We're not a company that place for the short term. we don't.

  Speaker 1
  Solut the question. Let me me answer in reverse order. A first thing that i learn, and i think it's prodly common a across seos, especially a inner industry, as hit. Would be great if i had more. I think there's especially because were grow in so many areas, and there's so many things to learn. So manya, relationships to build, a time to spend with a number of different technologies and a and, but i kind of reflect really the size of the opportunity that exists for quacum quocum. It is really growing in a number of different directions, all at the same time. And so it did got busier. And part of this is because i'm spending a lot of time understanding the new industries were going in and building relationships. Second thing, which is a lot to do with how i think about things and a little bit of my personality. At the end of the day, business partnership is really done by people. And i importance of having trusted relationships for the long term a is extremely important, and i've been dedicated to do that a co we're not a company that place for the short term. We don't. And when we build new partnerships, we expect that to be for decades. And so i i spend time doing that, and think that's important for qualkum. The other part of a your question is, we do have a lot of opportunities in all different areas, whell we like. And i've been fortunate enough to becomeyo at a time that a lot of the trends are pointing to our technology. We talk about some of them. We talk about mersure of physical and disital spaces. We talk about the transformation f the automobile. We talk about the merge of computing and mobo, the enterprise, transformation of the home. They're many of those strands.
