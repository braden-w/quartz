## Highlights
- You Really Can Get So Good That They Can't Ignore You
  Summary:
  i know that i s brutally difficult to hear. If we're dealing with insecurities, then that may be the only solution. No matter how good you think you are, you're still being ignored. And if you find yourself doing that, i will say, hit the brakes right? You've got to get to the point where it would just be absurd to anybody looking at that situation to think that you weren't killing it.

  them. And if you find yourself doing that, i will say, hit the brakes right? Because first and foremost, you always want to look at what you could be doing. So there's two things you could be doing up in your game. No matter how good you think you are, you're still being ignored. And so if we talk about getting so good that they can't ignore you, then we know that we haven't achieved that yet. And then the second thing you can do is move on. And well, i know that i s brutally difficult to hear. If we're dealing with insecurities, then that may be the only solution. So first, i want to focus the most of our attention on this idea that you really can get so good that you can't be ignored. And i think a great example of this is garry van chuck. Now, if you guys don't know his story, it's such a cool story of somebody who came up working for their father. Their dad, i'm sure, in many ways, thought of them the same way that, you know, he was just the kid. And it got to the point where garry saw an opportunity for him to do something in a completely different part of the business, where he could establish himself. So now it was about an area that his father didn't understand, his father didn't have expertese, and garry could show with results, point blank, that he was able to do something that his father wasn't. He took ther a liquor store business from something like six million dollars in revenue to, i think, almost 70 million dollars in revenue. I mes, extraordinary in a relatively short period of time, just a few years, if i'm not mistaken. So that's the kind of thing there's no way, no matter how insecure the other person is, no matter how they may have their own a problems, emotionally soothing, or staying centred, or getting their ego out of the way, whatever the things are that they're dealing with, there's no way to look at those numbers and not say, a ight, clearly, what he was doing is working. And to me, that is where you have to get. You've got to get to the point wherei it would just be absurd to anybody looking at that situation to think that you weren't killing it.

- Be Kind to the Worst Player
  Summary:
  You're never going to get people's respect until you're actually good. Phil jackson said that until he helped michael become a leader, they didn't win championships because michael was so antagonistic. And if you read 11 rings by phil jackson, he talks about that transition that jordan went through. That me, is extraordinarily telling of greatness, that you get yourself good, extraordinary, to the point where people can rely on you. You're really pursuing greatness.

  But you should be able to have, maybe even more kindness for the person struggling to do that. The person that is may be paralyzed or overwhelmed, that even as you're going that hard cores, that people can see that you actually care about humans, that it isn't just who's got something that they can do for me, who's going to be able to lift me up and help my project, but you're looking for ways to help other people. You're going out of your way to be kind to people. That's if its worth its weight in gold. But you're never going to get people's respect until you're actually good. So now imagine being the best on the team and being kind to the worst player that's pried out the right way about amenites two ideas out. I think you do need to hold the worst player accountable, but john wooden, one of the greatest basketball coaches of all time, said that he would judge people when he was scouting a high school player. That there were times where he would intentionally have like a the tor or the water boy or something, spill water around a player he was recruiting, cause he wanted to see how they would react. And if they were a jerk to that person, he wouldn't bring them on the team. Because he knew it's not just about finding the best players. It's about finding people that can work together, finding ways to create harmony. Le's about michael jordan. Phil jackson said that until he helped michael become a leader, they didn't win championships because michael was so antagonistic. And looked michael was hard on people his whole career. Dong me wrong. But he said he had to help michael understand that he had to play as a team, that this couldn't be just about jordan. And now, if you look at the things that jordan talks about, he always credits the team, the team, the team. I was a part of a winning team. And he'll rattle off the players by name. And if you read 11 rings by phil jackson, he talks about that transition that jordan went through. And that me, is extraordinarily telling of greatness, that you get yourself good, extraordinary, to the point where people can rely on you. You're you're really pursuing greatness.
