## Highlights
- Speaker 1: structures 
  Speaker 0: involved in some of the neurochemicals involved. We 
  Speaker 1: will talk about some of that 
  Speaker 0: today. 
  Speaker 1: Often overlooked however, 
  Speaker 0: is that memories are not just about learning. Memories are 
  Speaker 1: also about placing your entire 
  Speaker 0: life into a context 
  Speaker 2: and that's because what's 
  Speaker 1: really special about the 
  Speaker 2: brain and in particular 
  Speaker 0: the human brain is its ability to place events in the context of past events, the present 
  Speaker 2: and future 
  Speaker 0: events and sometimes even combinations of the past and 
  Speaker 1: present or present and 
  Speaker 2: future and so on. 
  Speaker 0: So when we talk about memory, what we're really talking about is how your immediate experiences relate to previous and future experiences. Today 
  Speaker 1: I'm going to make clear how that process 
  Speaker 0: occurs. Even if you don't have a background in biology or psychology, I promise to put it into ([Time 0:00:28](https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e36de6f4a6f5a96aac7f))
    - Note: The human brain is fantastic for being able to understand past and future
- Speaker 0: with all the things that are 
  Speaker 1: happening in any one given 
  Speaker 0: moment. Now, memory is simply a bias in 
  Speaker 2: which perceptions 
  Speaker 0: will be replayed again in the future 
  Speaker 2: anytime you 
  Speaker 0: experience something that is the consequence 
  Speaker 2: of specific 
  Speaker 0: chains of neurons that we call 
  Speaker 2: neural circuits 
  Speaker 0: being activated. And memory is simply a bias in the likelihood that that specific chain of neurons 
  Speaker 1: will be activated 
  Speaker 0: again. So, for instance, if you can remember your name and I certainly hope that you can Well that means that there are specific chains of neurons in 
  Speaker 1: your brain 
  Speaker 0: that represent your 
  Speaker 1: name. And when 
  Speaker 0: those neurons 
  Speaker 1: connect with one 
  Speaker 0: another and 
  Speaker 1: communicate electrically 
  Speaker 2: with one another in a particular sequence 
  Speaker 0: you remember your name. ([Time 0:09:46](https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e36de6f4a6f5a96aac73))
    - Note: Memory is just a specific bias for a chain of neurons to be activated
- Speaker 0: That can be done and is impressive when we see it and for those of you who can do that, congratulations. 
  Speaker 1: Most of us can't 
  Speaker 0: do that or at least it requires a 
  Speaker 1: lot of effort in training. 
  Speaker 0: However, 
  Speaker 1: there are things that we can do that 
  Speaker 0: leverage the natural 
  Speaker 1: biology of our nervous 
  Speaker 0: system to 
  Speaker 2: enhance learning and memory of 
  Speaker 0: particular perceptions and particular information. Let's 
  Speaker 2: first just talk about the most 
  Speaker 0: basic ways that we learn and remember things and how to improve 
  Speaker 2: learning and memory 
  Speaker 0: And the most basic one is repetition. The study of memory 
  Speaker 2: and the 
  Speaker 0: role of repetition actually dates back to the late 18 hundreds, early 19 hundreds when ebbing House developed the first 
  Speaker 2: so called learning 
  Speaker 0: curves. 
  Speaker 2: Learning curves are 
  Speaker 0: simply what results when you quantify ([Time 0:13:25](https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e524e6f4a6f5a96ae5a9))
    - Note: Learning curves and Ebinghaus
- Speaker 0: actually dates back to the late 18 hundreds, early 19 hundreds when ebbing House developed the first 
  Speaker 2: so called learning 
  Speaker 0: curves. 
  Speaker 2: Learning curves are 
  Speaker 0: simply what results when you quantify how 
  Speaker 2: many repetitions of something 
  Speaker 0: are required in order to remember something. In fact it's been said that Ending House liberated 
  Speaker 2: the understanding of 
  Speaker 0: learning from the philosophers by generating 
  Speaker 2: these learning 
  Speaker 0: curves. What do you mean by that? Well, 
  Speaker 2: before 
  Speaker 0: heading House came along, 
  Speaker 2: learning 
  Speaker 1: and memory were thought to be philosophical 
  Speaker 0: ideas. Ending House came along and said, 
  Speaker 1: well let's actually take 
  Speaker 0: some measurements, let's measure how well I can remember a sequence of words or a sequence of numbers if I just repeat them. So what ending 
  Speaker 2: House did is he ([Time 0:13:58](https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e524e6f4a6f5a96ae5f7))
    - Note: Learning Curves
- Speaker 2: he would 
  Speaker 0: write down as many of them 
  Speaker 2: as he could and he would try 
  Speaker 0: and keep them in the same 
  Speaker 2: sequence. Then he would 
  Speaker 0: compare to the original list and he would see how many errors he made 
  Speaker 1: you do this over 
  Speaker 0: and over and over again. 
  Speaker 2: And as you would expect 
  Speaker 0: early in the training 
  Speaker 1: and the learning, 
  Speaker 0: it took a lot more repetitions to get the sequence 
  Speaker 1: correct and over time 
  Speaker 2: it took fewer 
  Speaker 0: sequences. And he 
  Speaker 1: referred to that difference 
  Speaker 0: in the 
  Speaker 1: initial number of 
  Speaker 0: repetitions that he had to perform 
  Speaker 1: versus 
  Speaker 0: the later number of repetitions that he had to perform as a so called savings. 
  Speaker 2: So he literally 
  Speaker 0: thought of the brain as 
  Speaker 1: having to 
  Speaker 0: generate a kind of a currency 
  Speaker 2: of effort and 
  Speaker 0: he talked about savings 
  Speaker 2: as the reduction 
  Speaker 0: in the amount of effort that he had to 
  Speaker 2: put forward in 
  Speaker 1: order to learn information 
  Speaker 0: and what ([Time 0:14:53](https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e524e6f4a6f5a96ae5d4))
    - Note: How Ebinghaus found the learning curve (and relating it to a currency)
- Speaker 2: a memory 
  Speaker 0: and that might all seem like a big 
  Speaker 2: duh, but prior to 
  Speaker 0: having House, none of that was known now. I should also say Leading house because of when he was alive, was not aware of these things that we called neural circuits, it was in 1906, that 
  Speaker 2: Goldy 
  Speaker 0: alcohol got the Nobel 
  Speaker 2: prize for actually showing that neurons are independent 
  Speaker 0: cells connected by synapses, these little gaps between them where they communicate. So he may have been aware of 
  Speaker 2: that, but the whole 
  Speaker 0: notion of neural circuits hadn't really come about. 
  Speaker 1: Nevertheless, what the ending 
  Speaker 0: house learning curves really established was that sheer 
  Speaker 1: repetition, 
  Speaker 0: just repeating things 
  Speaker 1: over and over and 
  Speaker 0: over again is sufficient 
  Speaker 2: to learn 
  Speaker 0: something that no doubt had been observed before, but 
  Speaker 2: had never been 
  Speaker 0: formally quantified. 
  Speaker 2: Now, 
  Speaker 0: if we look 
  Speaker 2: at that result, ([Time 0:16:05](https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e524e6f4a6f5a96ae5b1))
    - Note: Sheer repetition allowed him to learn
- Speaker 2: that allowed him 
  Speaker 1: to 
  Speaker 2: remember now, sometimes later in the early 
  Speaker 0: to mid 1920s, 
  Speaker 2: a psychologist 
  Speaker 0: in Canada named Donald Hebb came up with what 
  Speaker 1: was called heads 
  Speaker 0: postulate and heads 
  Speaker 1: postulate, 
  Speaker 0: broadly speaking, is this idea 
  Speaker 2: that if a 
  Speaker 0: sequence of neurons is 
  Speaker 2: active at 
  Speaker 1: the same time 
  Speaker 0: or at roughly the same time 
  Speaker 1: that that would 
  Speaker 0: lead to a strengthening of the connections between those 
  Speaker 2: neurons and many, 
  Speaker 0: many decades 
  Speaker 2: of experimentation. Later we 
  Speaker 0: now know that postulate 
  Speaker 1: to be true neurons 
  Speaker 0: themselves 
  Speaker 2: are not smart, they don't have 
  Speaker 0: knowledge. So every memory is the consequences 
  Speaker 2: I told you before 
  Speaker 0: of the repeated activation 
  Speaker 1: of a particular chain 
  Speaker 2: of neurons 
  Speaker 0: and ([Time 0:17:09](https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e524e6f4a6f5a96ae5c1))
    - Note: Ebinghaus doesn’t consider that information memorized wasn’t more interesting on second attempt
- Speaker 0: leads to a 
  Speaker 2: bias in the probability that those neurons 
  Speaker 1: will be active again. 
  Speaker 0: This is vitally important because nowadays we hear a 
  Speaker 2: lot about how 
  Speaker 0: memories are the consequence 
  Speaker 2: of new neurons 
  Speaker 1: added in the brain 
  Speaker 0: or that 
  Speaker 2: every 
  Speaker 0: time you learn something, a new connection 
  Speaker 1: in your brain forms 
  Speaker 2: well, sorry to 
  Speaker 0: break it to you, but that's simply 
  Speaker 2: not the case 
  Speaker 1: most of the time and I want 
  Speaker 2: to emphasize 
  Speaker 1: most not all, but most of the 
  Speaker 2: time when we learn 
  Speaker 0: something, it's because 
  Speaker 1: existing neurons, 
  Speaker 2: not new 
  Speaker 0: neurons, but existing neurons strengthen their connection through 
  Speaker 1: co 
  Speaker 0: activation over and over and over through repetition or 
  Speaker 1: and this is a very important 
  Speaker 0: or or through very strong 
  Speaker 2: activation 
  Speaker 0: once and only 
  Speaker 2: once. ([Time 0:18:13](https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e524e6f4a6f5a96ae5dd))
    - Note: Learning happens with 1. Existing neurons strengthen in coactivation OR 2. Strong one time activation (one trial learning)
- Speaker 2: partner's hair? 
  Speaker 0: These sorts of things. That's an explicit 
  Speaker 1: declarative memory, but 
  Speaker 2: you also have 
  Speaker 0: explicit 
  Speaker 2: procedural memories. 
  Speaker 0: Now, procedural memories, as 
  Speaker 2: the name suggests, 
  Speaker 0: involved action sequences. The Simplest one, it's 
  Speaker 2: almost ridiculously simple, is 
  Speaker 0: walking. If I say, how 
  Speaker 2: Is it that you walk from one room 
  Speaker 0: to the other? You'd probably 
  Speaker 2: say, well I go that direction, 
  Speaker 0: I turned left, I said no, no, no, no. 
  Speaker 1: How is it 
  Speaker 0: exactly that you do it and say, 
  Speaker 2: well I move my left foot and my right foot and my left foot. And you could describe 
  Speaker 1: that. So it's an 
  Speaker 0: explicit procedural memory. 
  Speaker 2: So much so that if you were 
  Speaker 0: going to teach a 
  Speaker 2: young toddler how to 
  Speaker 1: walk, you would probably 
  Speaker 0: say, okay, good, good try, Okay, 
  Speaker 1: and you, you know, probably that's going to be pre language for the toddler, 
  Speaker 0: but you're going 
  Speaker 1: to encourage them to move 
  Speaker 0: one ([Time 0:23:55](https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e524e6f4a6f5a96ae5ef))
    - Note: Procedural memory
- Speaker 2: you could describe 
  Speaker 1: that. So it's an 
  Speaker 0: explicit procedural memory. 
  Speaker 2: So much so that if you were 
  Speaker 0: going to teach a 
  Speaker 2: young toddler how to 
  Speaker 1: walk, you would probably 
  Speaker 0: say, okay, good, good try, Okay, 
  Speaker 1: and you, you know, probably that's going to be pre language for the toddler, 
  Speaker 0: but you're going 
  Speaker 1: to encourage them to move 
  Speaker 0: one leg then the other 
  Speaker 1: and you're going to 
  Speaker 0: encourage and reward 
  Speaker 1: Them for moving one leg 
  Speaker 2: than the other because you 
  Speaker 0: have an explicit procedural 
  Speaker 2: memory of how 
  Speaker 0: to walk. Okay. 
  Speaker 2: Almost ridiculously simple. 
  Speaker 0: Maybe even truly 
  Speaker 2: ridiculously simple, 
  Speaker 0: but nonetheless, 
  Speaker 2: when you think about 
  Speaker 0: in the context of neural 
  Speaker 1: circuits and neural firing. Pretty 
  Speaker 2: amazing. 
  Speaker 0: Even more amazing 
  Speaker 1: is the fact 
  Speaker 0: that all 
  Speaker 1: explicit memories, 
  Speaker 2: both 
  Speaker 1: declarative and 
  Speaker 2: procedural explicit 
  Speaker 1: memories can be ([Time 0:24:24](https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e524e6f4a6f5a96ae5b9))
    - Note: Both declarative and procedural explicit memories can be turned to implicit memories (you just know how to walk or ride a bike without explaining)
- Speaker 2: memories are 
  Speaker 1: formed. 
  Speaker 2: It is not 
  Speaker 1: where those memories are 
  Speaker 0: stored and maintained. 
  Speaker 2: It is 
  Speaker 0: where they are established in the 
  Speaker 2: first place, in 
  Speaker 0: contrast, implicit memories, right? 
  Speaker 1: These subconscious 
  Speaker 2: memories are 
  Speaker 0: formed and 
  Speaker 1: stored elsewhere in the brain, 
  Speaker 2: mainly 
  Speaker 0: by areas like the cerebellum, but also the neocortex, 
  Speaker 1: the kind of outer shell 
  Speaker 0: of your brain. The cerebellum 
  Speaker 2: is literally means 
  Speaker 0: mini brain 
  Speaker 2: and it does in fact look like a mini brain 
  Speaker 0: and is in the 
  Speaker 2: back of the brain. And 
  Speaker 0: the neocortex is the outer part of the brain that covers all the other stuff. So the 
  Speaker 2: hippocampus is vitally 
  Speaker 0: important for establishing these new 
  Speaker 2: declarative memories 
  Speaker 0: of what you 
  Speaker 2: know and 
  Speaker 1: what you know how 
  Speaker 0: to ([Time 0:27:15](https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e524e6f4a6f5a96ae5ff))
    - Note: Explicit and implicit memory is stored in hippocampus and outside brain (cerebellum) areas, respectively.
- Speaker 2: lesions actually burned 
  Speaker 0: out the 
  Speaker 2: hippocampus in the brain of hmm and as a 
  Speaker 0: consequence he lost all 
  Speaker 1: explicit memory. 
  Speaker 2: Now. The consequence of this was 
  Speaker 1: that he couldn't exist 
  Speaker 0: in normal everyday 
  Speaker 1: life, like most people, 
  Speaker 2: so he 
  Speaker 1: had to live 
  Speaker 2: mostly, not not entirely, but mostly 
  Speaker 0: in a kind of hospital 
  Speaker 2: setting. And I've 
  Speaker 0: talked to several people 
  Speaker 2: who have, who 
  Speaker 0: I should say, 
  Speaker 1: who met H. M. 
  Speaker 2: Directly because he's no 
  Speaker 1: longer alive. 
  Speaker 2: But 
  Speaker 1: an 
  Speaker 0: interaction with him might 
  Speaker 1: look like the following. 
  Speaker 0: He would walk up to you just fine. You wouldn't know that he had any kind of brain 
  Speaker 2: damage, 
  Speaker 0: He could walk fine, 
  Speaker 2: he could speak fine. 
  Speaker 1: And he'd say, hi, 
  Speaker 0: I'm Andrew and he'd say, hi, 
  Speaker 2: I'm whatever his 
  Speaker 1: name happened to be a ([Time 0:30:11](https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e56ee6f4a6f5a96aed3a))
    - Note: HM and the removal of hippocampus led to no more new memories (to remove foci)
- Speaker 1: He knew 
  Speaker 0: the names of people 
  Speaker 1: that he had 
  Speaker 0: met much earlier 
  Speaker 1: in his life and so 
  Speaker 0: on. And 
  Speaker 1: yet he couldn't form 
  Speaker 2: new memories 
  Speaker 1: now in violation to that 
  Speaker 2: last statement. There were some elements of hmm 
  Speaker 1: emotionality 
  Speaker 2: that 
  Speaker 1: suggests that there was some 
  Speaker 0: sort of residual 
  Speaker 2: capacity to 
  Speaker 1: learn new 
  Speaker 0: information. But it wasn't 
  Speaker 2: what we normally 
  Speaker 0: think of as 
  Speaker 2: explicit declarative or 
  Speaker 0: procedural memory for 
  Speaker 2: instance, it's been reported 
  Speaker 0: or it's been said I 
  Speaker 1: should say because I don't know 
  Speaker 0: that the studies were ever 
  Speaker 1: done with intense physiological measurements 
  Speaker 2: that if you 
  Speaker 0: were to tell h. 
  Speaker 2: M. A joke. 
  Speaker 1: And he thought it was funny. He would laugh 
  Speaker 2: really hard. 
  Speaker 0: So he liked jokes. So you tell me you say hmm, I want to tell you a 
  Speaker 1: joke. You tell ([Time 0:32:17](https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e56ee6f4a6f5a96aed42))
    - Note: HM could remember old memories and how to walk
- Speaker 0: funny just 
  Speaker 2: as keep 
  Speaker 0: this in mind, folks, 
  Speaker 2: if you tell a joke 
  Speaker 1: and you get a big laugh, 
  Speaker 2: don't tell it 
  Speaker 0: again, at least 
  Speaker 1: not immediately, not to the same 
  Speaker 0: person or the same 
  Speaker 1: crowd. Because the second time, it's a little less 
  Speaker 0: funny. And the third time, it's a little 
  Speaker 1: less funny. And that actually has to 
  Speaker 0: do with the whole element 
  Speaker 2: of dopamine 
  Speaker 0: and its relationship 
  Speaker 2: to surprise. 
  Speaker 0: And that's the topic of 
  Speaker 2: a future podcast where we 
  Speaker 0: talk all about humor 
  Speaker 2: and novelty 
  Speaker 0: in the brain. 
  Speaker 2: But the point 
  Speaker 0: being that 
  Speaker 1: certain forms of 
  Speaker 2: memory seem to exist 
  Speaker 0: in a kind of phantom like way within HMOs 
  Speaker 1: brain. What do I mean by that? 
  Speaker 2: Well 
  Speaker 0: this underscores the fact that he had an 
  Speaker 1: implicit memory 
  Speaker 0: of having heard 
  Speaker 1: the joke before 
  Speaker 2: and it suggests 
  Speaker 0: that humor 
  Speaker 2: or at least what we find funny is somehow more related ([Time 0:33:33](https://www.airr.io/quote/62947b2fe6f4a6f5a97e0479))
    - Note: Telling a joke to HM and it would be less funny each time (even though he forgets you told him)
- Speaker 1: sadly gunshot 
  Speaker 0: wounds and other 
  Speaker 2: forms of what 
  Speaker 0: we call infarct. Infarct. 
  Speaker 1: I. N. 
  Speaker 0: F. A. R. C. T. Infarct 
  Speaker 2: is the 
  Speaker 0: word we use to describe damage 
  Speaker 1: to a particular brain region. 
  Speaker 2: Then 
  Speaker 1: many different 
  Speaker 2: patients with many different patterns of 
  Speaker 1: infarct have 
  Speaker 0: taught us a 
  Speaker 2: lot about how memory and 
  Speaker 0: other aspects of the brain 
  Speaker 2: work 
  Speaker 1: hmm 
  Speaker 0: really teaches 
  Speaker 2: us 
  Speaker 1: that what we 
  Speaker 2: know and what 
  Speaker 0: we are able to do 
  Speaker 2: is the consequence of things 
  Speaker 0: that we are aware of 
  Speaker 1: and learnings 
  Speaker 0: that have been passed off 
  Speaker 2: into subconscious 
  Speaker 1: knowledge that our body 
  Speaker 0: knows our 
  Speaker 2: brain knows but 
  Speaker 1: we don't know 
  Speaker 2: exactly how we 
  Speaker 1: know that thing 
  Speaker 0: and I tell you the story 
  Speaker 1: about H. M. S. Ability 
  Speaker 2: to understand ([Time 0:34:54](https://www.airr.io/quote/62947b2fe6f4a6f5a97e0495))
    - Note: Subconscious memory, and humor being a mix of implicit memory
- Speaker 2: works. 
  Speaker 0: But the problem for most 
  Speaker 2: people is that they either don't have the 
  Speaker 0: patients, they don't have the time and sometimes they literally don't have the time 
  Speaker 1: because they've got a deadline 
  Speaker 0: on something that they're trying 
  Speaker 1: to remember and learn 
  Speaker 2: or they simply would 
  Speaker 0: like to be able 
  Speaker 1: to remember things 
  Speaker 0: better in general remember them more 
  Speaker 2: quickly. 
  Speaker 0: This process of 
  Speaker 2: accelerating 
  Speaker 0: repetition based learning 
  Speaker 2: so 
  Speaker 0: that your learning curve doesn't go from having to perform 
  Speaker 2: Something 1000 times and then gradually 
  Speaker 0: Over time it's one 
  Speaker 2: 1750 times a day, 
  Speaker 0: 500 times a day, 300 times a day and down to no 
  Speaker 2: repetitions right? You can just perform that thing the first time 
  Speaker 1: and every time. Well 
  Speaker 0: there is a way 
  Speaker 2: to shift that 
  Speaker 0: curve so 
  Speaker 2: that you 
  Speaker 0: can essentially establish ([Time 0:37:35](https://www.airr.io/quote/62947b2de6f4a6f5a97e026f))
- Speaker 1: I didn't come up with this, this one um by um steve Gonzales Todd, a former student of mine marty Hales and randy Thornhill and some other um very smart players in the field. And um and what they used as uh markers of good genes are things like symmetrical features uh and masculine features, so strong jawline, high shoulder to hip ratio. Um You know, other other sorts of masculine features. But I started to doubt this explanation for what women want in the short term. Um because of some other findings. So for for ([Time 0:40:59](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a64ef93f707348d6cb0325))
    - Note: Emotion laden experiences are much more likely to be rememberd.
- Speaker 0: uh a rigorous analyst of what is true in the scientific community also helps you with great advice on how to live now. In contrast to that, I am a a terrible uh almost idiotic level journalist. So this is what you have to deal with. Another thing that people talk about that women care about is penis size. This penis size matter for women in sexual selection. 
  Speaker 1: Well, um there's controversy about that 
  Speaker 0: in the evolution of psychology community. 
  Speaker 1: Well, is their 
  Speaker 0: papers on penis size, 
  Speaker 1: I wouldn't say uh scientific papers, so speculations about 
  Speaker 0: in nature or in ([Time 0:51:46](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a653483f707348d6cb94cd))
    - Note: It is not the emotion, but the neurochemical state that you enter after experiencing the emotion.
- Speaker 2: consider 
  Speaker 1: getting your brain and body into a very calm 
  Speaker 2: and yet alert state. So high 
  Speaker 1: attentional state that 
  Speaker 2: will allow you to focus on what it is that you're trying to learn. 
  Speaker 1: We know focus is 
  Speaker 2: vital for encoding information and for 
  Speaker 1: triggering neural plasticity, 
  Speaker 2: but 
  Speaker 1: remaining calm throughout 
  Speaker 2: that time and then afterwards spiking adrenaline 
  Speaker 1: and 
  Speaker 2: allowing adrenaline to have these incredible effects on reducing the 
  Speaker 1: number of repetitions 
  Speaker 2: required to learn. So, if you're like 
  Speaker 1: me, you're learning about this information, this beautiful work 
  Speaker 0: of Logan and cahill and 
  Speaker 2: others and thinking, 
  Speaker 0: wow, 
  Speaker 1: I should perhaps 
  Speaker 0: consider spiking my adrenaline in one form or another 
  Speaker 1: at the 
  Speaker 0: tail end or immediately 
  Speaker 2: following an 
  Speaker 0: attempt to learn something.

  Speaker 1: And 
  Speaker 0: I just want to read to you the first 
  Speaker 1: opening paragraph of this 
  Speaker 0: review, which is, as 
  Speaker 1: the name suggests, all about memory and stress. 
  Speaker 0: So, here I am reading and I 
  Speaker 1: quote in 
  Speaker 0: medieval times communities through young Children in the river when they wanted them to 
  Speaker 1: remember important 
  Speaker 2: events. They 
  Speaker 0: believe that throwing a child in the water 
  Speaker 1: after witnessing historic proceedings would leave a lifelong memory for 
  Speaker 0: the events in the 
  Speaker 2: child 
  Speaker 1: believe it or not. This is 
  Speaker 0: true. This is a 
  Speaker 1: practice that 
  Speaker 2: somehow people arrived 
  Speaker 1: at. I 
  Speaker 0: don't know if they were aware 
  Speaker 1: of what adrenaline was 
  Speaker 0: probably not, 
  Speaker 1: but somehow 
  Speaker 0: in medieval 
  Speaker 1: times it was understood 
  Speaker 0: that 
  Speaker 1: spiking adrenaline 
  Speaker 0: or creating

- Speaker 1: And it's true in every culture. So uh in terms of, I don't know, um magnitude of effects, it's an effect size of more than a standard deviation difference between the means um on this psychological sex difference. And so one of the interesting things is so if you go to places like go to the most um gender. egalitarian cultures in the world. So places like Sweden or Norway which are explicitly gender egalitarian and and are truly in many, many ways. But you allow people freedom of choice. This some of these sex differences actually get larger. The psychological sex differences and also ([Time 1:16:03](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a653483f707348d6cb94cf))

  Speaker 0: would encourage the brain and body of 
  Speaker 1: that child to 
  Speaker 0: remember those 
  Speaker 1: particular events 
  Speaker 0: very counterintuitive. If 
  Speaker 1: you ask me, I ([Time 1:16:04](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a6540f3f707348d6cbb06e))
- Speaker 1: connections with other people and so forth. Um 
  Speaker 0: And 
  Speaker 1: I published a study a while back on on what's were called unmitigated agency and unmitigated communion. So you they're like 
  Speaker 0: good and bad 
  Speaker 1: aspects 
  Speaker 0: of agency 
  Speaker 1: and Communion so they 
  Speaker 0: can go, so there's toxic, as they say, masculinity, toxic femininity. You can just rephrase that saying there could be toxic agency and toxic communion. 
  Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. And so and so some 
  Speaker 0: elements 
  Speaker 1: of masculinity, uh the 
  Speaker 0: unmitigated 
  Speaker 1: masculinity is, 
  Speaker 0: I think 
  Speaker 1: terrible. I was actually walking around downtown Austin earlier today, just give this example. And this guy ([Time 1:37:38](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a653a23f707348d6cba0ce))
    - Note: People with photographic memory often struggle to remember audio or learn physical skills.
- Speaker 0: vehicles, it's so fascinating how the car and traffic brings out, like, the worst in human nature in a sense, or maybe to rephrase that it may be challenges you to explore something that in terms of temper, in terms of anger, in terms of anxiety that you have been bottling it up. There's something that where the car is like a vessel for psychological experiment of how much stress you can take. And some people that stresses like heating uh is making the water boil and it's fascinating to see what that results in, I think if you are the kind of person that explodes ([Time 1:38:54](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a653a23f707348d6cba0c7))
    - Note: Super recognizers (and facial recognition being a different module than memory)
- Speaker 2: a year 
  Speaker 1: I would look at something and decide to just 
  Speaker 2: snap a mental snapshot of it. 
  Speaker 0: And I've maintained very 
  Speaker 2: clear memories of those 
  Speaker 1: visual scenes. Two 
  Speaker 2: years ago 
  Speaker 1: I was in an Uber 
  Speaker 2: and I looked out the window and it was a street scene. I 
  Speaker 0: was actually in new york 
  Speaker 2: at the time and I decided 
  Speaker 1: for reasons that are still unclear 
  Speaker 2: to me 
  Speaker 1: to take a mental snapshot 
  Speaker 2: of this city street image 
  Speaker 1: even though nothing 
  Speaker 2: interesting in particular was 
  Speaker 1: happening. And 
  Speaker 2: um I do recall that there was a guy wearing a yellow shirt walking, there was some construction etcetera. I can still 
  Speaker 0: see that image in my 
  Speaker 2: mind's eye because I took this mental snapshot. 
  Speaker 1: This paper addresses whether 
  Speaker 2: or not this mental snapshot ng thing is real and this is 
  Speaker 0: something that I think a lot of 
  Speaker 2: people will resonate with 
  Speaker 1: whether or not the constant 
  Speaker 0: taking of pictures on our phones 
  Speaker 2: or with other devices ([Time 1:43:02](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a657c03f707348d6cc28fe))
    - Note: Taking a mental snapshop as a form of photographic memory
- Speaker 1: the position of 
  Speaker 2: the handles, how how 
  Speaker 0: broad or narrow these 
  Speaker 2: things are. 
  Speaker 0: You know, a lot of this is pretty 
  Speaker 2: detailed stuff. They also 
  Speaker 0: took photos of other 
  Speaker 1: other things. 
  Speaker 2: So basically 
  Speaker 0: what they found was that if people take 
  Speaker 2: pictures of things and 
  Speaker 0: they choose which things 
  Speaker 2: they're taking pictures 
  Speaker 1: of. Right? It's up to them. It's 
  Speaker 2: volitional that there's enhanced memory 
  Speaker 1: for those objects 
  Speaker 0: later on. 
  Speaker 1: However, it degraded their 
  Speaker 2: ability to remember auditory information. So what this means 
  Speaker 1: is that when we take a picture of something or a person, 
  Speaker 2: we are 
  Speaker 1: stamping down a visual 
  Speaker 2: memory of that thing and that makes 
  Speaker 1: sense. It's a photograph after all. But we are actually 
  Speaker 0: inhibiting our 
  Speaker 1: ability to remember 
  Speaker 2: the auditory, 
  Speaker 0: the sound component 
  Speaker 2: of that visual scene ([Time 1:45:38](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a657c03f707348d6cc2911))
    - Note: Taking pictures of things with a camera enhances visual but not audio memory of the moment (even if you delete or don’t look at the photo again)
- Speaker 2: or not those particular neurons were played in the precise sequence that happened 
  Speaker 1: when they encoded the memory 
  Speaker 2: or 
  Speaker 0: whether or not those neurons were played in a 
  Speaker 1: different sequence or 
  Speaker 2: even if those neurons were played activated. That is 
  Speaker 1: all at once with no temporal 
  Speaker 2: sequence, all firing in 
  Speaker 0: concert all at 
  Speaker 1: once evoked the same 
  Speaker 2: behavior and in some sense 
  Speaker 0: the same memory. 
  Speaker 2: So at a 
  Speaker 1: neural circuit level, this is 
  Speaker 2: deja vu, 
  Speaker 0: this is 
  Speaker 1: a different pattern 
  Speaker 0: of firing of neurons 
  Speaker 1: in the brain, leading 
  Speaker 0: to the same sense 
  Speaker 1: of what 
  Speaker 2: happened, leading 
  Speaker 1: to a 
  Speaker 2: particular emotional state 
  Speaker 0: or behavior. 
  Speaker 2: Whether 
  Speaker 0: or ([Time 1:51:06](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a657c03f707348d6cc2921))
    - Note: Deja Vue is a different firing of neurons that triggers a very similar sensation as a previous memory.
- Speaker 2: This particular study I 
  Speaker 1: like so much because 
  Speaker 0: they used a really 
  Speaker 2: broad array 
  Speaker 1: of measurements 
  Speaker 2: for cognitive function, 
  Speaker 1: Things like the Wisconsin card sorting 
  Speaker 2: task. I'm not gonna go into this things like 
  Speaker 0: the Stroop task 
  Speaker 2: and they also, as I 
  Speaker 1: mentioned, measured cortisol 
  Speaker 0: and many other things, 
  Speaker 1: including not surprisingly, 
  Speaker 2: memory 
  Speaker 0: and people's ability to 
  Speaker 1: remember certain types of 
  Speaker 2: information. In fact 
  Speaker 1: very types of information. And 
  Speaker 0: the basic takeaway 
  Speaker 1: was again that you could get really robust 
  Speaker 0: improvements 
  Speaker 1: in learning and memory, 
  Speaker 2: mood and attention 
  Speaker 1: From just 13 minutes a 
  Speaker 2: day of meditation. Now there's an important 
  Speaker 1: twist in this study that I want to 
  Speaker 2: emphasize. If you read into 
  Speaker 1: the discussion of this study, 
  Speaker 2: it's mentioned ([Time 1:56:41](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a657c03f707348d6cc2931))
    - Note: Huge gains in memory with 13 minutes of meditation per day.
- Speaker 2: order to participate or they're 
  Speaker 1: given um something 
  Speaker 0: as compensation for being 
  Speaker 1: the study. But oftentimes the 
  Speaker 2: meditation or in the case of 
  Speaker 1: my lab, the respiration work or other 
  Speaker 0: kinds of um 
  Speaker 2: things that they're assigned to 
  Speaker 1: do are not their 
  Speaker 2: top top priority and 
  Speaker 0: we understand this. But 
  Speaker 1: in this study, the majority of subjects here I'm reading completed their meditation, 
  Speaker 2: sent sessions from 
  Speaker 1: eight somewhere 
  Speaker 0: between eight and 
  Speaker 2: 11 p.m. and sometimes 
  Speaker 0: even between 
  Speaker 1: 12 and three a.m. 
  Speaker 2: I think there probably were a lot of college students enrolled in this study and they're ours 
  Speaker 1: often our late 
  Speaker 0: shifted 
  Speaker 1: that impaired 
  Speaker 0: sleep. And this raises a 
  Speaker 1: bigger theme that I think is important many times before on this 
  Speaker 2: podcast. And certainly in the 
  Speaker 0: episode on mastering sleep and um conquering or mastering stress those episodes, we talked about the 
  Speaker 2: value again of these ([Time 1:58:02](https://www.airr.io/quote/62a657c03f707348d6cc294e))
    - Note: Meditating late in night can interfere with sleep because it increases attention.
