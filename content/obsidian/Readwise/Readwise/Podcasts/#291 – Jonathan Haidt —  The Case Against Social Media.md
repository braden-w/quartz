## Highlights
- The Correlation Between Social Media Use and Mental Health
  Summary:
  Something is going radically wrong in the world of american pretens. It started right around 20 12, 20 13 and it wasn't gradual. Nobody has come up with another explanation. The data is, of course, as everyone knows, correlation doesn't prove causation.

  Ah, but it's two to three times more common now, or by 20 15, it had doubled. Between 20 ten and 20 15. It so something is going radically wrong in the world of american pretens. And whatw so as i've been studying it, i found, first of all, it's not just america. It's identical in canada and the u. K. Australian new zealand are very similar there, ust after a little delay. So whatever we're looking for here, but yet, it's not, it's not as clear in the germanic countries. In continental europe, it's little different. And we can get into that when we talk about childhood. But something's happening in many countries a that. And it started right around 20 12, 20 13. It wasn't gradual. A, it hit girls hardest, and it hit preteen girls the hardest. So what could it be? Nobody has come up with another explanation. Nobody. It wasn't the financial crisis, that wouldn't hit preteen girls the hardest. A, there is no other explanation. The complexity here. And the data is, of course, as everyone knows, correlation doesn't prove causation. The fact that television viewing was going up in the fifties and or in the sixties and seventies doesn't mean that that was the cause of the crime. So what i've done a, and this is work with jean twang, who wrote the book, igen is ah. Because i was challenged you know, one nigt. When gregg and i put out the book, the coddling themerican mind, some researchers challenged us and said, oh, you do't nowha. You're talking about, you know, the correlations between social media use and and mental health. They exist, but they're tiny. It's its no like e correlation coefficient of point o three, or ou kno bata of point o five, ina, tiny little things.

- How to Stop Bullying Girls
  Summary:
  The main one, i think, which does in the girls, is not being bullied a it's living a life where you're thinking all the time about posting. You're scrolling through whan everyone's life looks batter than yours because its fake. And all that you see are the ones the algorithm picked that were the night. There's no way to make it safe. Ther it's unsafe at any speedil mean, it might be very difficult to make itSafe. In a short term, while we don't know how to make itsafe, put down the phone. Play with other kids via a platform like row blocks or multiplar vidicims. That's great,

  anxiety? And the number one thing they say is social media. So there's multiple strands of evidence. Do you think the
  Speaker 2
  recommendation is as apparent that teans should not use instigram? Yes.
  Speaker 4
  Litter. Yes. That's

  all tome. Maybein the long term, there's a more

  no ways. There's no way to make it safe. Ther it's unsafe at any speedil
  Speaker 2
  mean, it might be very difficult to make it safe. And in a short term, while we don't know how to make it safe, put

  down the phone. Well, now, hold on a second.
  Speaker 1
  Play with other kids via a platform like row blocks or multiplar vidicims. That's great, iave, no beef with that. You focus on bullying before. That's one of five or seven different avenues of harm. The main one, i think, which does in the girls, is not being bullied a it's living a life where you're thinking all the time about posting. Because once a girl starts posting, so it's bad enough that theyre scrolling throughand thiss, everyone comments on this. You're scrolling through whan everyone's life looks batter than yours because its fake. And all that you see are the ones the algorithm picked that were the night. Anyway, so the scrolling, i think, is bad for the girls. But i'm beginning to see, i can't prove this, bat i'm beginning to see, from talking to girls, from seeing how it's used, is once you start posting, that takes over your mind. And now you're basicall. You're no longer present a because even if you're only spending five or six hours a day on instagram, you're always thinking about it.
