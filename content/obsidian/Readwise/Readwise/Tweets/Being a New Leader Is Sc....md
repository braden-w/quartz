- 1. Disregard reputations
  Everyone has a reputation.
  Completely disregard them.
  Approach your role with fresh eyes.
  Give people the gift of a clean slate.
  That will let them make their own impression. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TMitrosilis/status/1553366332346929152))
- 2. Micromanage early on (kind of)
  Starting out, micromanage your team.
  Wait, isn't micromanaging bad?
  Yes, but this is different.
  The purpose here is to learn.
  Ask people to teach you their jobs.
  Dive into the details with them.
  It shows humility + respect for the work. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TMitrosilis/status/1553366334448324608))
- 3. Leverage your ego
  Every leader has an ego.
  Some are just honest about it.
  Ego can destroy poor leaders.
  It also can propel the best ones.
  Great leaders don’t deny their ego.
  They leverage it to better the team. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TMitrosilis/status/1553366336570593280))
- 4. Use controlled intensity
  Nobody wants an emotional leader.
  But they do want to feel your emotion.
  Think of this as controlled intensity.
  Dial it up + dial it back thoughtfully. 
  Never out of control. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TMitrosilis/status/1553366338902581253))
- 5. Relationships are your job
  A team is a connected body of people.
  Connection comes from trust.
  Trust comes from relationships.
  Your job is to forge these every day. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TMitrosilis/status/1553366340831936512))
- 6. Act with relentless integrity
  What’s integrity?
  Do the right thing.
  Do it the right way.
  Do it at the right time.
  And do that all the time.
  As a leader, you set the tone for your team. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TMitrosilis/status/1553366342899752961))
- 7. Accept that it’s your fault
  You are accountable for everything.
  Mistakes aren’t “the team’s” fault.
  They are your (the leader’s) fault.
  This is a critical mindset shift.
  Accept it and watch what happens. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TMitrosilis/status/1553366345177333760))
- 8. Share in the credit
  Most say “take blame, pass credit.”
  But I say take blame, share in the credit.
  You’re a TEAM— that includes you.
  Honor the team, but don’t deny your role.
  People see through your false humility. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TMitrosilis/status/1553366347555422211))
- 9. Believe when nobody does
  Part of a leader’s job is to instill belief.
  In the mission.
  In the person.
  In the team.
  It’s easy when everyone believes.
  It’s hard when others don’t.
  Believe when belief is hard to find. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TMitrosilis/status/1553366349694509056))
- 10. Be decisive
  Indecision crushes teams.
  Get feedback + perspective.
  But when it’s time to decide?
  Decide.
  An incorrect decision is better than no decision. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TMitrosilis/status/1553366387833323521))
- 11. Remember the human
  There’s a human being behind every professional.
  Never forget that.
  Take care of your people. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TMitrosilis/status/1553366390995881987))
