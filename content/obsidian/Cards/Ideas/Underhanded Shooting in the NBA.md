# [[Underhand]]ed Shooting in the [[NBA trends scores easier trends scores easier]]
Since each point in an [[NBA trends scores easier trends scores easier]] season is worth around $10K to the player, I’d shoot FTs with my butt if I would hit 90% and help my team win. Given how much money is at stake, I wonder why the coaches haven’t demanded the sub 70% FT shooters to shoot underhand, cool or not.
