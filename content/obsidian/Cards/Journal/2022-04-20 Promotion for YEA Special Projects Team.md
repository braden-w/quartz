# 2022-04-20 Promotion for YEA Special Projects Team
Want to Get More Involved in YEA Leadership? Join the Special Projects Team (aka Board)!:bulb:

Calling all [[Effective Altruism|YEA]] members who are interested in getting more involved in YEA leadership! The Special Projects Team (aka Board) is recruiting members for the 2022-2023 school year.

The Special Projects Team is an action-oriented team for YEA members who believe in using creativity and leadership to do the most good. Our mission is to generate entrepreneurial initiatives for YEA that expand the movement in innovative directions. Projects include expanding YEA's online and social media presence, speaker events, socials, career workshopping, and existential risk and longtermist presence.

Requirement
Entry has one requirement: you must be able to attend at least two 90-minute coworking sessions per week during the 2021-2022 School Year.

For flexibility, we will hold at least three 90-minute sessions per week (to be determined in a Doodle Calendar Poll). This is on par with leadership for other clubs, for a total for 3 hours a week.

How to Join
If you are interested in joining, please fill out this form and join on Slack!

So don your Special Forces Gear :military_helmet::medal: and looking forward to seeing you!
