# [[2022-04-11 Intro Fellowship]] Message to Evelyn Regarding David, Kelvin, Kai, and Sonny
Hey Evelyn! I have four friends—David Peng, Kelvin Yip, Kai Xu, and Sonny Nguyen—who all have approached me and expressed interest in working at Emerge this summer in any capacity. Of the people who have approached me so far, I think they are particularly good fits—they’re CS majors who have coding experience and are early in their careers, so they are willing to specialize in new technologies such as Unity. Additionally, they could help solidify a presence on Yale’s campus—I’m currently investigating a potential deal between Yale CCAM and Emerge’s hardware, since Yale CCAM has expressed high interest in using our tech. Is there anything that I should do on my end in enabling them to connect and/or work in the student projects team?
