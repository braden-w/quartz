# [[2022-02-09]] Letter to Phil Trammel to Apply to Impact Economics
[[Effective Altruism]]

Dear Phil,

Thank you so much for the response!! My interest for the course remains :) I’m sure you must be very busy and hope this email does not find you late!

- Here is my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/braden-wong/), and my Resume is attached
- My statement:

- I am drawn to Topics in Economic Theory & Global Prioritization because it would fill a gap in my EA knowledge and fulfill a personal desire for exploration, during my most ideal summer to study something new. Since I first became involved with Effective Altruism, I have been drawn to Policy and Artificial Intelligence—hence, my majors in "Ethics, Politics, & Economics" and "Computer Science & Psychology"—and sought a more rigorous analysis and understanding of EA concepts. Though I have taken several advanced STEM and computing courses, I have intended to plunge back into policy—and this summer would be an ideal time to do so. Unlike my first-year summer, I have kept my sophomore summer open and free from all commitments these past months to reserve it for personal exploration. Coincidentally, I already have tentative plans to study in Europe (and if so, likely London) this summer, which would take place before the course.
- I hope that my extensive involvement and interest in EA philanthropy can serve the class well. I am not an economics savant, who will blow through every problem set with ease. Rather, I am an EA organizer who is willing to struggle and grapple with the curriculum, in hopes of emerging a better thinker, facilitator, and organizer in Yale Effective Altruism.

- My academic transcript is attached below

- I’m currently registered as a Computer Science & Psychology major, but I will register for Ethics, Politics, & Economics in my junior year (after which I may seek to double major)

- "I consent to the attached data being handled by the Forethought Foundation to process this application.”

**For planning:
**

- 85%. As I mentioned earlier, I have kept my sophomore summer open for exploration, and this course meets those desires. I value the course highly, additionally as a study abroad opportunity, and so I prioritize it over work experience or research.
- Moving the program dates to be earlier, if possible. I am not certain when my classes at Yale start, though I will do everything in my power to ensure attendance is feasible. Otherwise, no other changes; I’m fascinated by your curriculum!

**Some of the strongest reasons that I should not attend, for your consideration:**

- I have not completed intermediate microeconomics

- I do have extensive experience with Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra in high school (I took the AP Calculus BC exam in 9th grade, and have been studying upper level classes since then).
- In my first semester, I took Math 230, a theory heavy vector calculus and real analysis class. To explain why I pass-failed Linear Algebra in my second semester, I wished to reduce the workload of a 6-class schedule (I had already been exposed to it but needed to take it for a major requirement). I tested out of introductory micro and macroeconomics, and am familiar with the Lagrange maximization problems, should that be of use

- I do not live in the UK

- I have a visa. I am also applying to another study abroad program in Britain, which will finish before the class begins.

- I sent this application after the deadline

- There was an error in the newsletter, but I always could have applied earlier.
- I am just very grateful for your offer to consider my application!

Best,

Braden Wong
