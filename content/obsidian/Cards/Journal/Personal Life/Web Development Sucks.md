title: Web Development Sucks
---

# Web Development Sucks
- Early web was optimized for documents, and we have been hacking ever since to expand it to get things to work
- We've expanded the Document User Interface so much that we are limited by its initial principles
- We're trying to do a bunch of things that are not document like with a document
- Like [[Fitting a peg in a square hole]]
- [[Modern web bloat]]
