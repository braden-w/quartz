# [[2022-03-08]] Email for Summer Experience Award to Katie Donley

## Yale Student with Funding Seeking Summer Opportunity (Offering to Work for No Cost)
Dear Katie Donley, Greetings and hope this finds you well! My name is Braden, and I'm currently a Yale first-year student seeking a degree in Ethics, Politics, & Economics and Computer Science.

I've secured special funding from Yale for a nonprofit internship this summer, and I'm interested in working with GiveDirectlyâ€”it is undoubtedly my first choice! The funding enables me to work for completely no cost to GiveDirectly, in either a physical or remote environment.

Ever since I was first introduced to GiveDirectly last May, I have been drawn to the simplicity and effectiveness of GiveDirectly's core principles (as well as its application in other area). I have been heavily involved with Effective Altruism since high school senior year, and assisting you in your mission would bring me immense satisfaction (and I hope to you as well)!

I understand that I am only a first-year, and even working for free still will still require a degree of investment from GiveDirectly. However, should there be room for me, I am willing to work diligently for at least 8 weeks, 30 hours per week, and amplify the returns of investment. I'm willing to fill in any roles that you believe would be most suitable for my skillsets, with particular interested in any roles related to software engineering or growth of GiveDirectly and the Effective Altruism movement.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration!

Sincerely, Braden Wong [braden.wong@yale.edu](mailto:braden.wong@yale.edu) 6266274599
