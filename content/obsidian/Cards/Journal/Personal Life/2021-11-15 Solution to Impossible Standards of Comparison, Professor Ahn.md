# [[2021-11-15]] Solution to Impossible Standards of Comparison, Professor Ahn

## How Can We Avoid Comparing Ourselves to Standards That Are Too High?
Similar to [[Planning Fallacy]], we can consider viewing ourselves from the third person, reminding ourselves that everyone probably has similarly impossible standards of comparison for themselves. Therefore, when we view ourselves in the third person, we are viewing ourselves in the same way we would view those people with impossible standards. Reminding ourselves of how irrational others are with the mindset, then viewing ourselves in the 3rd person, helps us with these impossible standards.
