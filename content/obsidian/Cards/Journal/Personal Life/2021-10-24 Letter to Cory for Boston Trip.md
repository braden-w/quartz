# [[2021-10-24]] Letter to Cory for Boston Trip
Hey Cory! This is Braden. I just woke up and wanted to say thank you so much for yesterdayâ€”for making time from your busy schedule to accommodate [[Carrie]] and me, treating us to the coolest places in Boston, giving us a tour of your suite ðŸ’¯, curing us of our homesickness in China town with clay pot rice and boba, walking down seaport for the Institute of Contemporary Art and Taiyaki, taking a stroll down Newbury, chatting over Korean seafood pancakes, accompanying us across public transportation, and helping us feel welcome and comfortable in Boston. It seems like you dedicated so much time and energy for us, and I was just utterly blown away. Your and [[Carrie]]â€™s banter was so charming, and you were so fun to talk to, kind, patient, and generous. Thank you for hosting such an amazing experience; Boston is my favorite experience of the semester. I hope you have a wonderful weekend and absolutely crush the rest of your work!!
