# [[2021-10-24]] Talk with [[Sonny]] and David in the Common Room After Their Trips
Talked about

- Our different trips - [[Sonny]] in D.C., and Johns Hopkins - Apparently the food at Johns Hopkins was super bad haha - David in NYC - [[Tiger Sugar]] is fire - Me at Boston - [[Dante Motley|Dante]] at Maine - Julia's family is quite affluent and so the facilities were crazy good
- Flutter Development - Lightning USB C cables - We'll work together in the Zoo later to work together
- Grades and GPA (our new target is a 3.0, which means we are super in the clear)
- Possible November ski trip or other activity - Our different experiences skiing ([[Sonny]] has never done skiing while David has)
