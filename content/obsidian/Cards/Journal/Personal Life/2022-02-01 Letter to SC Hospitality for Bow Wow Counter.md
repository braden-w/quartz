# [[2022-02-01]] Letter to SC Hospitality for [[Bow Wow Counter]]
Dear SC Hospitality,

Any sort of database, spreadsheet, or page with prices and/or availabilities of items would be massively appreciated.Â 

A friend of mine recently had an intense period and skipped lunch to get Alleve, but the Bow Wow had run out, which compounded her side effects. This was actually the incident that prompted us to email, in hopes that we could avoid this problem in the future.

There have been several other instances when my friends or suitemates ventured to the Bow Wow (at the cost of their lunch swipe) and were forced to resort to less favored items.

If more compelling evidence is required, we can also actively share through the YDN, YCC, YDA, YEA, and other student organizations (I have cced members of those organizatinos who have expressed a vested interest in the project).

Even if availabilities are difficult to track, just having the prices and items at minimum would be a wonderful quality of life update that would enable students to plan their trips and what to buy in advance.

Best,

Braden Wong
