Dear Yale Effective Altruism Organizing Team,

Welcome back and happy new year, {first name}! You’re receiving this email because you are a part of the YEA Board, now known as the YEA Organizing Team!

My name is Braden, and I am the director of the organizing team. I will be responsible for coordinating organizing team projects, cultivating a healthy inclusive team culture, and ensuring that you feel safe, connected, and empowered throughout the school year.

## Before We Begin, Here Are the Key Actionables:
- Read the following five updates in detail

- Think about your schedule this semester and what you'd like to see or make happen. I will be personally reaching out to you to gather input on what you would like to do this semester

- Come to the Onboarding Workshop this Saturday 4-5PM

- Fill out this [When2Meet](https://www.when2meet.com/?14347023-H5Rgg) to decide time of ODD by Saturday 7PM (January 29)

1. ## Name Change: Board => Organizing Team

We are now called the YEA Organizing Team, as part of our mission to better reflect our values and accurately encapsulate our roles in YEA. The name is more inclusive (“board” connotes “board of directors”), better encompasses what we do (organize), and signals an openness that “board” did not—that organizing team is for everyone, and anyone can get involved in YEA’s mission.

### Why the Change?
Over winter break, the YEA Exec Team (Eui Young Kim, Thomas Woodside, Miriam Huerta, Matthew Burtell, Braden Wong, Teddy Tawil) held a series of strategy meetings where we examined community and board survey results, and brainstormed methods to improve organizing team management and member experience. We decided to try something new this semester, and part of that is the name change.

2. ## Our Values + Ground Rules

Specific values we hope to embody are:

1. Truth-seeking

2. Open-minded and humble

3. Desire to take action to improve the world

4. Self-motivated and agentic

5. Respectful

6. Actively seeking out constructive feedback on how we can improve

Some ground rules:

1. We hope that organizing team members respond to Slack messages within 24 hours. If for whatever reason you cannot respond within this time frame, please reply saying you will reply in X amount of time, or say that you are too busy at the moment to do this task, etc.. If there will regularly be times during the week when you will not be checking Slack or responding to messages, such as the weekend or in the evenings, put it in your slack bio and we will not expect responses from you within these times.

2. If you can’t complete a task, or it has found its way into your [ugh field](https://medium.com/@robertwiblin/ugh-fields-or-why-you-can-t-even-bear-to-think-about-that-task-5941837dac62) (long-overdue tasks that you really don’t want to start), please let me know and we’ll find a way around the problem, e.g. by helping you break down the task into manageable chunks, doing a certain part of the task for you, or delegating to someone else.

3. Above all, you should feel comfortable enough in your position to reach out to me if you feel you are unable to complete a task. If a task cannot be completed in time, I will not be upset if you tell me—we can always work around it. The worst case scenario is not telling me, and it isn’t completed

3. ## Open Board Meetings are now ODD + Coworking

### What Does ODD (Open Discussion Dinner) Replace?
ODD + Coworking combines two initiatives from last semester:

1. Board meetings: a space where people could see their friends every week, and a space where you could get YEA tasks done together.

2. Weekly discussions: a different topic and facilitator every week for all YEA members, and anyone is welcome to facilitate or suggest a topic.

### What Does ODD (Open Discussion Dinner) Replace?
The new format comprises a weekly 2 hour block:

1. ODD (60 min): is an opportunity open to all Yale students and YEA members to build community and chat about various Effective Altruism topics, in an open dinner discussion format.

2. General Coworking (60 min): we open the floor to everyone, where you have the opportunity to work on anything (YEA projects, homework, personal projects, etc.) you want with your EA Peers.

### Sign Up to Facilitate a Topic for ODD!!

Our first ODD and coworking will be virtual next week, but we plan on having ODD and coworking at the EA house depending on when the campus-wide quarantine ends.

4. ## Apply to the In-Depth Fellowship!

The IDEA Fellowship is a 9-week program in which fellows complete assigned readings and meet for a 90-minute discussion each week. Topics span moral philosophy, rationality and epistemology, high-impact cause areas, [[Longtermism]], and more. The first few weeks of the program include a structured reading list, while later weeks give fellows the flexibility to dive deep into topics that interest them.
