# 2022-02-13 Overhaul to YEA Organizing Table AirTable
Heads up, I made a slight overhaul in the Organizing Team AirTable. Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 tables are combined and now all found under the "Organizing Team" tableâ€”you can click on the left panel to change views. This leads to fewer tabs than before and allows continuity of several properties (like onboarding).Additionally, I made an "Onboarding" form for Organizing Team that walks through the steps of our presentation. As they check off the form, it will create an entry in the AirTable and check off all corresponding onboarding boxes. We can use this in the future as a checklist for onboarding new members
