# [[2021-11-02]] Letter to Da'Von to Ask for Letter of Recommendation
Dear Da'Von,

Greetings and hope this email finds you in wonderful spirits! It's Braden, one of your former students from PLSC 118 section last semester!

I am currently applying for the Richard Light Fellowship, a fellowship that enables students to embark on study-abroad experiences for intensive language study. Part of the application is a recommendation from a non-language academic course, and you were the first person that came to mind!

I was wondering if you would feel comfortable endorsing my candidacy from an academic context in the application—it would be an absolute honor to receive your words of recommendation!

The recommendation will be an evaluation comprised of the following questions, and should hopefully take no more than an hour. Its deadline is January 5, 2021.

1. Please indicate in what context and for how long you have known the candidate.

2. Light Fellows are expected to invest a great deal of personal initiative into their studies. In your experience, how does the applicant respond to challenges? Is the applicant inquisitive? Are they respectful, open, and able to clearly and competently communicate in discussions?

3. Light Fellows will interact in their programs not only with a new culture but also with students from varying backgrounds. Please comment on the applicant’s ability to handle differing views or opinions. How do they respond to criticism?

4. The language programs supported by the Light Fellowship are known for their rigorous academics and demanding schedules. In your experience, how does the applicant perform under intensive academic pressure?

5. Having spoken with the student about their motivations and plans, do you feel the proposal is well conceived? Well timed? Fits well with the student's overall academic interests and goals?

6. (Optional) Please comment on any other factors which you believe may have a bearing on the applicant’s experiences overseas or on their potential to succeed as a Light Fellow.

To expedite this process, I would be happy to send materials or arrange a quick meeting to share my background and plans for the semester. A lot of time has passed since we last met, so we can definitely catch up!!

My sincerest thanks for your time and consideration!

Sincerely,

Braden Wong
