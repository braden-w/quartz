# How I Can Help
Would love to chat about any interesting opinions you have about EA, maximizing impact, and entrepreneurship.

Am also on the hunt for non-profits to work with this summer; I have special funding from Yale University to embark on any underfunded work opportunities this summer!

# How Help Me
I've secured funding from Yale to work for any registered non-profit this summer for no cost.

Looking to create value for your non-profitâ€”whether it be in front-end development, quality assurance, growth, or any other opportunities to exercise leadership, public speaking, writing, and more!

Would love to receive your advice or chat about interesting opinions you have about EA, maximizing impact, and entrepreneurship. I've secured funding to work for any non-profit this summer, and so any additional resources would be greatly appreciated!
