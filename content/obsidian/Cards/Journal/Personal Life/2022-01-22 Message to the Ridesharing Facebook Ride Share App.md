# [[2022-01-22]] Message to the Ridesharing Facebook [[Ride Share App]]
Hey everyone!! I've been gathering various ridesharing trips (26 trips in the next few days) across this page and made a little concept website to try coordinating ride sharing: https://yaleshare.netlify.app/

Ideally, it allows us to

 - Add trips from airports to Yale or vice versa
 - Groups them by airport
- Sorts them by time
 to make scheduling as fluid as possible.

Do y'all have any suggestions on how we could make it better? Some thoughts were:

 - Getting notifications when there is a new signup for your date and airport
 - Privacy of information, or contact information
 - Anything else you guys want

If so, feel free to message me!! Only been working on it for about a day, so there's room for improvement!

Mahesh Agarwal brought up the ride sharing problem to me a few days ago and how we could go about tackling it (huge shoutout to him!)
