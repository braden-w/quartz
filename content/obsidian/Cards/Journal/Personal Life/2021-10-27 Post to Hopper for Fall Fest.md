# [[2021-10-27]] Post to Hopper for Fall Fest
Hey everyone, Hopper Fall Fest is this Friday from 1:30PM - 4PM! Been working with the Head's Office and dining, here's the details you need so far:

1. 2 Crates of pumpkin carving and painting
2. 12 Dozen Cider Donuts
3. 8 Gallons of Hot Apple Cider
4. Popcorn machine
5. Two baskets of Apples
6. Professional photographer with a Halloween backdrop, decorations, and photo ops

Most of our requests ran into difficulty due to COVID policy or cost (12-foot skeleton is out of stock :/). Made a special push for skeletons, since I know we really pushed for that. To my understanding, the photographer is loaded and will provide most of the decorations we requested

If it rains, it will take place inside the dining hall instead. If weather permits, we will also set up Cornhole and Spikeball.Â  Trick or treating and candy stations will be offered on October 31 during our YSO Screening Event (more info on that soon)! Hope you all have a wonderful Halloween weekend!
