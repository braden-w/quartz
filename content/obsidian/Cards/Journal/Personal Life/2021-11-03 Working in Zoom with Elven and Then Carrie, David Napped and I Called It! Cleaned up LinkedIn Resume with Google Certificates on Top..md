# [[2021-11-03 Random Jokes and Thought]] Working in Zoom with Elven and Then Carrie, David Napped and I Called It! Cleaned up LinkedIn Resume with Google Certificates on Top.
Worked in the Zoo and watched a bunch of [[CPSC 323]] videos to catch up. Cleaned up the notes and had a great time!

Afterwards, Elven arrived and showed me to the Robotics Lab

Carrie arrived and I told Elven I had a sense that Carrie was here and stood up. There she was right around the corner! Elven was impressed by my "6th sense" haha

We talked about various parts of our past,

David showed up a little more on the late side. He overslept which I had predicted to Elven.

Afterwards, I took more notes and cleaned up my LinkedIn Resume so my best certifications showed up on the top.
