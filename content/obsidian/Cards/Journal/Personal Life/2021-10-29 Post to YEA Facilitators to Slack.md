# [[2021-10-29]] Post to YEA Facilitators to Slack
This week, we’ve had 3 of our facilitators absent and 1 late without notice or a message right before/after the session started. Normally one absence wouldn’t be a big issue, but both cohorts started out severely understaffed. Thankfully we were quick thinking and improvised a great discussion

The reason I’m posting this is not to point fingers; I’m here to understand and help us move forward—this week was super rough for all of us. Next time, please give us more notice and do your best to attend. It’s unfair to the other facilitators who show up, and impacts our quality of discussion

Please don’t beat yourselves up about this. I love and appreciate all of you, and am sure you can do better to help us avoid this in the future. Just know that your actions have consequences, and your help and attendance is invaluable to us

On a personal note, I apologize if my energy hasn’t been as good recently—I’ve felt a little down in the past few weeks. My Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday nights are always filled due to back-to-back EA meetings or the fellowship. It’s usually well and good, but emergency facilitating both sessions and seeing some of us struggle to show up once a week affected my morale, to the point where I sometimes feel unwilling to show up to EA events. I will be back better next week
