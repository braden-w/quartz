# [[2021-11-18]] Contemplating on Switching Back to Todoist From Sorted
Incredibly grateful for my time with Sorted. However, I think that the best move is to go back to Todoist.

I have been acquainted with new paradigms of organizing with Sorted, and so will be using those moving forward.

This idea of

1. Only showing relevant calendars in the feed
2. Having faster insert into projects / lists compared to sorted
3. Use Sorted paradigms in Todoist
