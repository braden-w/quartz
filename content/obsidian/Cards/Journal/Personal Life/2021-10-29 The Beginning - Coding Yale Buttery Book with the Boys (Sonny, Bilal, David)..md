# [[2021-10-29]] The Beginning - Coding [[Yale Buttery Book]] with the Boys (Sonny, Bilal, David).
Talking about our diabolical plan for Taki domination, and soy and meat substitutes with Tony, Sonny, and David. Then [[Bilal]] joins, and we have a lovely time sharing it with him. I float the idea of having an app that tells you which butteries are open.

Suddenly, we have an epiphany and start coding. Another whiteboarding session, just like [[The birth of Project Insomnia]] [[Bilal]] bikes all the way to Carrie's to fetch my backpack so that I can code. I feel so grateful for both of them for giving me this.

As Halloween music blasted in the background, we coded for ages. We used Quasar to scaffold something quickly. [[Bilal]] was in charge of getting all the information to display.

-“It was Halloween night.” Braden Wong wrote to the News. “We had just conceived the idea at 12:53 am. I told the lads I could probably get a prototype done by the end of the night—but I had left my computer in a friend’s suite. Without second thought, [[Bilal]] raced in the pouring rain on his bike to get my computer. Together, we pulled a near all-nighter until we had a working user interface.”
