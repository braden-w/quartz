# [[2022-02-05]] Letter to Eric Tu About [[Effective Altruism]] and [[YEA Fellowship]]
Dear Eric,

I am so sorry for the delay in this email; I was reaching out to past fellows and had realized this email had somehow slipped by me!

I sent out a Calendly invite in my last email; would you like to grab a plate someday [here](https://calendly.com/braden-w/grab-a-plate?back=1&month=2022-02&date=2022-02-01)? Given your special circumstances in the past semester with attendance, it could be especially helpful for us to sync up.

The fellowship (both intro and In-Depth) has gone a massive revision since last semester, and is more flexible in time slots (taking place over dinner)—and I think you would make a wonderful fit for our In-Depth fellowship.

But beyond fellowships, I am also interested in having you on board our organizing team (leadership team) if you are interested, as a way to continue getting involved this semester.

And here are some quick responses to your points that you outlined (we can talk about them more when we have our 1 on 1):

> Q1: I’m thrilled you feel this way about [[Longtermism]], and particularly nice that you cited the 80,000 hours article! You cited qualms against the [[Person-Affecting View]], which I agree with! I personally view/express [[Longtermism]] mostly through the lens as “making a world safer for our children” because that is, in my opinion, a more mainstream and easily adopted by the average person. Some relevant articles may be found in [https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Person-affecting_view](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Person-affecting_view), [https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/HyeTgKBv7DjZYjcQT/the-problem-with-person-affecting-views](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/HyeTgKBv7DjZYjcQT/the-problem-with-person-affecting-views)

> Q2: I like this analysis of forecasting!
>
> Q3: I think we are in agreement here; I generally stray away from the utilitarian calculus but think that EA’s general principles are better than the alternatives we have when it comes to evaluating charities.

Best,

Braden
