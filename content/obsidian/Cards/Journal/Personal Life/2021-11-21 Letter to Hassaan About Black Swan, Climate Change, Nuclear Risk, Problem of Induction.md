# [[2021-11-21]] Letter to Hassaan About Black Swan, Climate Change, Nuclear Risk, [[Problem of Induction]]
Dear Hassaan,

Thank you so much for your reading responses! I wanted to give a thorough response, see below for details:

> I really enjoyed your analysis on Le Chatelier’s principles and its application to climate change, as well as thoughts on Nuclear Risk. When we next speak, I’m interested in testing some of the intricacies and limits of this position.
>
> I think the biggest idea worth exploring is that of a “[[The Black Swan]]”: the notion that unexpected phenomenon—things that we don’t know that we don’t know—can have large ramifications. Especially when we construct models where we essentially rule out the idea of unexpected risks, we are open to an enormous amount of risk that could be realized if those unexpected risks happen. Using statement 3, that "the past 10,000 years have had the climate in equilibrium" supports two hypotheses essentially equally:
>
> 1. That the climate will stay in equilibrium forever
>
> 2. The climate will stay in equilibrium until year 10,001, on which it will heat up drastically and lead to a mass extinction
>
> As you can see, if either statement were true, we would still observe a wonderful climate in the first 10,000 years. So if we observe the climate is in equilibrium in the first 10,000 years, how can we be certain we aren’t living hypothesis #2?

Thank you so much and looking forward to our next discussion together!!

Best,

Braden
