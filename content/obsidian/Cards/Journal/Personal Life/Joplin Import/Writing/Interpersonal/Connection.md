In Bed

"Love through your heart

Shower with your spouse

Fingertips conduct heart, then dick energy"

Be Present

 

Make the Commitment to Love

"Why we don't say we love, just going out and liking people

 

Heart round top sharp bottom

 

Men are scared to talk to stranger women, from tribal history. You need social proof, and approaching stranger from clan is no laughing matter. One misstep could have killed. That's why it's rational."

 

How to Deal with Rejection

"The goal of relationships is not the end result, but the process. 100% of relationships end in breakup or death, or something complicated in between. If you are thinking of the end result, you're disappointed.

"

The glass is already broken. You're just finding out.

Buddhists have a great attitude about attachment to the physical world. They have a phrase that goes something like “See the glass as already broken.” They don’t overreact when something is destroyed or when a glass breaks because that glass is already broken. It is inevitable that the glass will break, so they see the glass as already broken—there’s no overdeveloped sense of attachment to it. Asking a woman out should be the same. If she says no, it’s not like you’re really LOSING something. Instead of getting bent out of shape if she says no, just say to yourself, “ah well, her loss.” One thing the Buddhists won’t tell you is that asking women out is a numbers game. The more you get out there, the more you increase your chances of a woman saying yes. Once you realize that it takes 9 no’s to get to a yes, the no’s don’t sting as much.

 

Women

 

Women need to be worse

Girls have only 1 shot, which is why they hit high

Slow down

Notice your breath and breathe deeply

Back of hand for light touch
