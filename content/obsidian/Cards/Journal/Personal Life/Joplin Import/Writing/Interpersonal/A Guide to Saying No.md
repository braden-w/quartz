Start with your yes, then their no, then a solution

**"You give respect not because of who they are but rather because of who you are"**

 

 

Quote from the book:

 

"Mom, I have a family as well, and they need me. I want to spend more time with them.

I will not be coming to visit every weekend anymore.

I propose to find a solution so that we can spend some time together while I also spend the necessary time with my family."

 

1. Prepare your positive no

Uncover your yes
Empower your no
Respect you way to yes

2. Deliver your positive no

Express your yes
Assert your no
Propose a yes

3. Follow through on your positive no

Stay true to your yes
Underscore your no
Negotiate to yes
