# The Ultimate Guide to Ownership
"Taking ownership as a leader is easy. Take a step forward if nobody else, take one back if someone else is. Own it when things go wrong, give credit to everyone when things go right. Sounds selfless and stressful but knowing to always do this is what helps the most

 

What roles. You mean what I was accountable for?

 

Own the problem even if it isn't yours. Then you are in driver seats. You take control.

 

Less Excuses, More Ownership. Gain ownership. I'm sorry because I have control. It was in my power. I'm aggrandizing

 

It is not weakness saying it was your fault. It is strength"

It is the ultimate refusal to accept you are helpless.

 

 

Three Types of Ownership

"1. All Excuse

2\. Analyzes and gives blame around

3\. Open up and just own it.

 

Most people go with 2, which makes sense. If you are smart and planned the event, you know where to place the blame

 

Here's the thing: they don't want to hear a rational argument.

 

Taking blame is about empowerment. Your narrative is that you had control."

 

Leadership not always about fairness, but the humility take responsibility

 

Why Gratitude is the greatest element of teamwork

"Feel like what you're doing is getting something done

Let them know they are making a difference, important"

 

Nobody is stupid if they know something is important/urgent enough

Most powerful is not to make people treat you as superior - it is to make them work with you in spite of it!

 

Establishing a Team Vision

"Importance of wanting the same thing in a team

 

Phrasing: Start with why. To \_\_\_ to\_\_\_\_

"

 

Avoiding common team mistakes

The higher you go in an organization, the more your suggestions become interpreted as orders.

 

How to Ask for favors

"Advice is that you need not to give a 10/10 explanation for everything. Just say what you want.

 

1\. We messed up (very slightly). We should have told you sooner. Can you help us and I would be like HELL YES

2\. Hey we made this decision here all the reasons we know it's in your way but can you move

 

A super awesome writer from Powwow but there's no need to set up the arguments in place

 

Just take ownership of what needs to be taken, we'll take ownership of our end, and we'll fix the problem together

 

You can a) explain yourself

 

or b) you completely understand

 

Someone who is confident enough to admit is someone I'd help 10/10 times anyday"""

 

Start with Why

Business focuses a lot on what, or how, but I feel not enough about why. Why is different--why is purpose. Why is meaning. Why is a vision. To paraphrase Simon Sinek, ""People don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it"". I think a lot of businesses could benefit from rethinking their company culture and mission. You don't always need a unique product, or a unique execution. You just need a unique reason.

 

Not just see, but notice

 

Slow together, fast alone. Fast is sometimes ok

Reverse pyramid. Teammates forward first, leaders behind

 

All we have is influence.

Never make people. Is manipulation

 

Exploit situations, not people.

Take advantage of the situation

 

No reason to not Frame the Nice Helpful Guy narrative

"People trust people who are on the same side. I am on the same side.

 

You need to study more. I would love to see you succeed.

 

It's not about what I want, it's about what you wish

 

Don't expect return.

 

Help me help you

 

Always Follow Through Commitments

If I say I will do something, I will do it. Otherwise, that is on me

 

Easier to say ask me for help than to say I need help

 

Lead yourself, or nobody else will

Leaders and followers. From ASB

 

# Most Important Skill: Not Work Ethic, or Time Management, but Prioritization
 

Prioritize your commitments for saving time

Prioritize others to delegate

Busy is lack of priority. Lack of control to do what you want
