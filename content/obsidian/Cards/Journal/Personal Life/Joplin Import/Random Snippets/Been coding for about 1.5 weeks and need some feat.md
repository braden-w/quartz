# Been Coding for About 1.5 Weeks and Need Some Feat
Been coding for about 1.5 weeks and need some feature requests!

Been coding for about 1.5 weeks and need some feature requests!

Feature requests! Will code almost anything :D

Hey guys! Been working hard on a small project this past week to help fellow remote Yalies connect. Ideally, as things open up, we will be able to find and meet with other remote Yalies around us in person! If this vision seems remotely interesting (haha get it 😆), you can join in a hot minute here: https://www.notion.so/College-Maps-94382a0123634301bd79bbf7d00d7dae Only been seriously coding this for about ~1.5 weeks so many more features to come! I’ll incorporate any feature you like, feel free to dm me. 🤩

Also please dm me/call me @6266274599

which problem, if any, do you think this app solves? totally good if no problem at all, that's actually a really enlightening answer! sorry for the random question 😆

ayy tysm bro! really appreciate the feedback 🙏 would it be ok if I stay in touch in the future for some advice? You def have more experience than me when it comes to college stuff haha

absolutely! and thank u so much for the awesome feedback 🙏 would it be ok if I keep in touch in the future for some of your advice as we move along? totally understand if you have other plans this summer

You joining as one of our core users would make my day (will take any feedback)
