Today was Joceline's birthday, mine being in only 4 days. We had an interesting message chain in the morning. The world is definitely changing HA
The best part is not having to fake your age on Facebook
 
 
Today has been a great day of calls, totaling four. In the first Google Call with Data Structures. Afterwards, a random call with Yalies covered UBI, Economics, Inflation, Mathematics, Number Theory, and Nuclear Physics. We had a student learning physics, mathematics, electrical engineering, and environmental science.
 
After that, a call about longtermism with Yale EA, and call with Evelyn about data science: namely, KAGGLE. Great notes obtained on the remnotes.
