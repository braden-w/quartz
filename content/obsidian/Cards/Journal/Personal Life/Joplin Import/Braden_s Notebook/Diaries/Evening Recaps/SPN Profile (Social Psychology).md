As an avid reader and technological enthusiast, I am drawn to tackling the ethical and economic implications of artificial intelligence and automation for the betterment of others. Through responsible research, I hope to explore responsible applications of AI in education and economic development to improve the quality of life around the world. I am a prospective Economics & Computer Science major and incoming freshman to Yale University, Connecticut.

I originally included my major and college in my first sentence, after consulting several other profiles as examples. However, in recalling our research on social judgements and the traces study, I realized that it is best to lead with my interests and passions. This concept has been echoed through author Simon Sinek and his concept of "start with why". Though I could have included academic accomplishments (e.g. I was student council president and valedictorian of my class), I decided to focus on what excites me for my description, as my accomplishments are already present in other mediums such as LinkedIn. I added a tagline and importantly, a strong profile picture, which may add to the first impression. As demonstrated in the yearbook study, the ability for others to discern and gain an impression of someone simply from there picture speaks volumes to how important and impactful a proper profile picture can be. At the very end of my description, I added my intended major and college. Comparing the two drafts I had, where one led with that sentence and the other ended, I found that the latter scored a stronger first impression with me. The inclusion of any accomplishments near the end rather than the beginning of a description is desirable.
