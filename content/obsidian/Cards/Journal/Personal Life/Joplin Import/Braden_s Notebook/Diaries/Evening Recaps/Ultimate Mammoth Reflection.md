# Grandma's Gone
I am playing with my phone when my dad comes into the room with terrible news.

 

"Grandma's gone."

 

Thus marks the straw that breaks the camel's back. This week has been incredibly taxing. Not only has the Mammoth trip been curtailed by the condition/passing of my grandmother, but I have struggled on a personal level to stay motivated after my rejection from M&T. Perhaps I have performance anxiety, of which Jeffrey affirms through a "lackluster" personal statement. What I must concede, foolish as I am, is that I am not perfect nor in complete control of my future. I only have ownership of the action, and not the result.

 

## Creating Realities
Lulu has already sent Grandma away. We might never see her again. I still remember the last time I saw her consciously, and the later time in which she was in a coma. The feeling is simply surreal, that this has been the first time a major person in my life has passed away. I have all of these memories of grandma, and have unlocked a more complex view of the world and thinking. In spite of these developments, the show must go on, and my life continue with her absence. I send my greatest prayers to grandpa in his struggle for meaning and purpose in these next few days. My regards that were sent to grandma were not fruitless, though not exactly fruitful either. In fact, this is an interesting point of introspection on my end: that my wishes often do not reach fruition in the same way that athetes create their own realities. Perhaps I can, in fact, create these realities. It is rooted in my ability to believe, past experiences, and trust that my wishes do, in fact, reach fruition through past events. The only way to reinforce this belief is to continue believing, which in turn may make things happen, which in turn will continue reinforcing \`this link between belief and actual outcome.

 

Though truly, I am incredibly saddened by this news by Grandma. Her passing marks an incredible leap in progress for my development, at which must bittersweetly come at the cost of someone else's end.

 

# Mammoth
Mammoth has been an incredibly enlightening and awesome experience. Driving with my family, feeling the warmth of the intereior of the car amidst the cold outdoors, and feeling the familial bonds within our cabin and with Jon and Michael has truly been an amazing experience. I hope to have similar experiences recreated in the future. The process of skiing, facing my fears, and descending down a moutnain at breakneck speeds is an incredilby breathtaking experience.

 

## Elisha
Meeting Elisha at Mammoth was a funny coincidence that also was incredibly terrifying. Her insistence on taking black diamonds, or even double black diamonds, was incredibly intriguing. It demonstrates that I have much to go as a skiier, and yet should also develop a similar confidence as she. After all, we have but the same equipment, similar technical abilities, and actual developments, but are only different by the level of confidence in which we tackle and tear up the slopes. This is something to be pursued with practice and repetition. Elisha is a funny specimen. Our discussion with Jon, about how terrible Cornell was terrible with its high suicide rates and how he didn't wish to find me at the bottom of a river, proved to be doubly ironic with the situation that Elisha had carved.

 

## Small World
It's a super small world. Meeting the same guy who saw me at Cool Cuts at Mammoth was quite funny. We saw a friend of Bryce and Michael's, too, at the top of the stairs. realizing how small this world is has given me hope but also slight caution for how I lead my life. There's a lot of things I must be careful with, should I ever be recognized in the future for an action.

 

## Quaint Gondala
Visiting the Gondala with my parents into the beautiful city palaza captivated the simplest bits of my imagination. The frosted glass of the gonadala resembled that of a beautiful ice wall, while the tall Christmas tree conjured images of Nicole in front of a similar object. The Gondala was another beautiful sight to see, truly.

 

# Car Ride
Among the most fun parts of any trip is the car ride. Gazing out of the window, observing the vastness of nature and true beauty of all that surrounds, is the most amazing part of any experience. That, and the minor car sickness associated with eyes glued to a screen.

 

## Naps
During the car ride, I spent an absurd proportion of the trip in deep sleep, in part from the melatonin pill that my mother had supplied at the beginning of the trip. Recognizing the importance of sleep has been a struggle when balancing the priorities of daily life. As one must embark on an innumerable number of endeavors, one cannot but feel that sleep must take a lowered priority on the scale.

Arriving into Mammoth was nothing short of absolutely beautiful. As the lights shined brilliantly onto the streets, one could not but feel how cuite and quaint the village truly was. I was absolutely floored by this and how absolutely great this town was. It was truly breathtaking and beautiful! Entering the Vons afterwards, purchasing non-lactose milk with John, and returning to the cabin was truly a memorably beautiful experience.

 

## Gokhale
Sometime along my journey in the Watch Later playlist, I finally decided to revisit the interview between Esther Gokhale and the running coach. It was immensely informative, demonstrating that there is clearly a need for proper instructions on how to sit, which resembles almost that of a slouching motion more than the upright standing one. Meanwhile, the demonstration of how to run, lengthening the psoas muscle, and optimizing movement s o that one is falling forward rather than pushing through the legs was an interesting long-term endurance strategy. These are definitely tips that I will be incorporating in my daily life later on.

 

## Google Coding
I was also incredibly impressed in watching the Google coding interview, investigating how to use computer algorithms to solve problem sets. The fact taht I arrived at similar techniques as the programmer, given my existing limited knowledge, is quite amazing.

 

## Sightseeing
Snow fell on the day of departure.Beautiful cascades of ice fell from the sky8 onto the mere mortals of ground surface. A tingling sensation fills my fingertips, definitely from my Wim Hof methods performed in the ice cold shower several hours before. Icy fields, snoww-covered plants all around us. The vastness of the world could not have felt more apparent, in the absence of all apparent civilization save a roud and one lonely car, that was once again a reminder of the place in which humans serve, subservient to nature.

 

## Delicious Bread
Picked up deliciouis bread from Bishop. Roast beef was good, but pastrami was absolutely delicious. Combined with the delectable selections of Sauerkraut and pickles, it was an absolute blast to chew through them.

 

# Maturity, Growing Up
Amid the recent developements, I cannot help but feel a bit childish compared to my peers. That, of course, will be used to my utmost advantage. I will now conduct a personal reflection on which areas may desire improvement, or are advantageous, and the best approach to approaching these shortcomings.

 

## I Care Too Much
This is perhaps the most important, and strangely immature, shortcoming of mine at the current moment. There is a lot of room for me to grow in the sense that I should care less, and simply be faithful of life taking its course. Why do I care too much? I believe that caring too much is the method to empower myself and take charge of the situation. In many ways, I am correct. It is far better to have a stronger internal rather than external locus of control. Either way, I will enjoy myself and become a better person through putting in my greatest effort and being done with it. However, I am unable to accept my greatest effort, as I would simply proclaim that it was not enough. Here is how I may address it:

 

Braden, I forgive you. That you tried your best, but then had victory snatched from your teech, or perhaps simply been outright rejection. I know you think you could have done more. I know it hurts. I know you will do better next time. No matter what, I just wanted to let you know that you will be okay. That fate has had a strange way of correceting your failures and shortcomings into opportunities to become the greatest. That no matter what may be of the present, the future will be okay in the long term. Your commitment to long-term planning should be an asset, and not a shortcoming, to be the very you can be.

 

## Tramatic Memories
There have been a bit of tramatic memories that I still hold, to which I cringe at certain instances. I must resolve to make myself at complete peace with them, and so here are them, in no particular order.

 

### Michelle
By far, this memory strikes me as the most tragic, perhaps due to its proximity to the present. Perhaps it was my leaning into the whole idea that I could do it, to go excessive, that ultimately made me regretful in the end. Why am I regretful? Perhaps it is my alienation from Michelle's friend group, and public embarassment. Though in reality, nobody knows except her friend group. I am worried about the repercussions, but in fact there are none.

 

### Winter Formal Dancing
Perhaps my embarrassment in this moment is from the fact that I was overconfident in my abilities and posted the video without second thought. Posting all of these videos have made me think that I was a talent, when in reality there are far more talented people in these departments. However, what I must remember is that every person has their own style and that it ultimately boils down to confidence, which needs not be trained necessarily if I am able to internalize it. Embracing that moment, and owning up to it as a fun period of my life that is now back to normal, is the best solution!

 

### M&T Rejection
Again, this was due to my overconfidence in my outcome and telling of people my plans before the results even came. Perhaps the most painful part was writing to the Edison Scholarship halfway through my plans when I received the bad news. Perhaps, however, it is not bad news. The biggest reason I am so saddened by this news is that I wanted to accelerate my learning growth in both management and technical positions at the same time, and very unfortunately, can no longer pursue or do that at the current moment. That, however, is a short term problem, and may not be the entire case. There is still the opportunity to learn technical skills and leadership, it is merely a longer time frame in which I do so. My dream, however, to work for tech startups might simply be short-lived or superceded by the program I go to instead. I felt a similar feeling to LBW several years ago, and yet was incredibly saddened at first that I would not go to Stanford. Looking back, I had so much fun at UPenn that I cannot have imagined have receiving at Stanford Humanities 2018.

 

## Colleges
As an Asian male, I cannot help but feel that all the cards are against me. However, remember that in reality, they are for me. College is an experience in which I will undoubtedly flourish, where I will meet new people and thrive in no matter what college God may choose to send me to. Of course, the big 5 for me are Harvard, Yale, Wharton, Stanford, and MIT. Any of those schools would be incredibly exciting and fun to approach with. That being said, even if I am unable to go to any of those schools, I will still be able to find a great opportunity no matter where I go. There is something about me that is unique, and I know where to find it. There has to be a way to make the best of both worlds. College is not an end-all be-all, but an accelerator to success. Think of it as analogous to a summer program, in which no matter where you may go, you will have an amazing time, just pushed in a different direction. That choice of direction, ultimately, is up to God. God, you have complete control of my fate and whether or not you wish to send me to these locations, so be it.

 

## Taking Ownership, Having Fun
Among the greatest advice I had received during my journey into Mammoth is to simply have fun. To take ownership of the outcome, and say that it is for the sake of having fun. That means that applying for college is for fun above all, that typing on the keyboard is an amazing pleasant experience, that reflecting on my life is an opportunity to have fun and really have fun.

 

## As I Type, on the Way Home
I feel only strangeness in ancipation for meeting Grandpa in the moments comoing up. I am about to see them after a long period, and will not know exactly what will be going on. It's normal for me to have a different kind of experience and strange experience. I'm not sure if Grandpa will be staying with us or at the nursing home or at someone else's. No matter what happens, I hope the best for Grandpa.

 

# Growing Up
Growing up is a tough process. Going to college is not the deal that seals it. Embracing complexity, my emotions, and the entire strangeness of life is the greatest development I will make sure to happen. I am no rush to grow up, but see every event as an opportunity to exploit and grow as much as I can.

 

# A Rough Week
This entire week has been sooo rough. First, got rejected from M&T. Then, Grandma gets ultra sick, right before our trip to Mammoth. Then, Jim's dad slips and passes. Then, Jim's car got broken into. Then, lost my earbuds. Then, college app stress. It's been quite a rough week, but a great learning experience. I'm going to do my best just to see what I can do. After this week, it will be just super sweet. I cannot wait to tackle

 

# Christmas
I can't believe I've been writing this all during Christmas eve. This is the strangest Christmas eve. Christmas is tomorrow, yet I don't feel anything particularly special about this time of year. Perhaps I have already received everything that I could ever ask for. I am grateful this time of year. It's about time to execute, improve, and adapt. Thank you Grandma, thank you Grandpa. I wish you the best.
