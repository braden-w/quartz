# Dinner with Lelan
Wednesday, September 30, 2020

7:58 AM

 

Dinner with Lelan. We had DELICIOUS SICHUAN cuisine and talked about . At the beginning things were a little slow but in the middle once we talked about some really fun topics! At first, she thought I was left-handed based off my use of chopsticks. Among them were our stories:

 

My story with student council
Insecurities
Writing competitions
Getting a B in my essay
My cousin Sierra Katow
History with Debate
Kantian interpretation: everyone learns information through their own narrow perspective
Validation
Compliments
Fishing for compliments
Are you trying to give me reasons to leave? Cuz it's not working
Don't put yourself down. That's my job
 

I assume the dinner went well because we kept talking for two hours! During that time, the food was absolutely delicious and the ceiling fell down on another couple. However, thankfully, everyone was safe.

 

Right when I came back, I did my best to clean my NMD's and succeeded! Used my toothbrush and lots of warm water to clean out the dirt from walking earlier.

 

I used my intuition and texted her dryly saying while I didn't think we clicked, I'm happy to give it another go or to be friends. She texted me that she didn't know this was a date until 10 minutes in and was dealing with a culture shock. However, that didn't detract from how much of a good time she had :) However, though she was okay having me as a friend, she said I was quite attractive and an interesting person and offered to go out a second time.

 

Oh, how she plays with my heart! I am not sure how to feel about today but the part where she flattered me really killed me. That night, I couldn't work on anything else and so decided to sleep early and call it a night.
