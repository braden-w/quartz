# Human Benchmark Autoclicker, Started Math Transcri
Human Benchmark Autoclicker, Started Math Transcri…

PM

Created a human benchmark clicker with Selenium! My reaction time is now &lt;25 ms. My brother suggested that I make a story called "haters will say it's fake" and I love it XD

 

Today, I started my math transcripts (completed 8 of Intermediate Algebra) and did some NitroType. I had a great call with Evelyn and Frank about cloud computing and the use of existing infrastructure to automate the service industry. Late at night, I talked to Dad about Nancy and Peter and how to negotiate in a principled fashion.
