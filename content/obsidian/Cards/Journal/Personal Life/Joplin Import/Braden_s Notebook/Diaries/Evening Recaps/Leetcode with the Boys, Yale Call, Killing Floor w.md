Today was a day of code and play.
 

1. Killing Floor with Stephen and Bryce. A lot of fun playing! I had a round with Stephen that was absolutely bonkers as everyone knew what they were doing. We destroyed the Matriarch

2. Leetcode with the boys. Did an F String and impressed the room. Some of these people are really good with competitive programming

3. Yale Zoom on Programming with Upperclassmen

4. Mastered Singing! Focus on placing voice forward
