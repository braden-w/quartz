Cooked Delicious Salmon!

PM

 

Today, I cooked a perfectly cooked salmon with a honey and herb baste.

 

1. Cooked salmon that was moist and perfectly cooked! Used honey and herb baste. There was a delicious spinach salad with Sesame dressing, as well as winter melon.

2. Played 5 games of Valorant. Hit some nutty shots with the Marshall and OP in Haven and the team told me those were some mad shots. Met a squad from San Fernando valley and queued with them! Did a 1v3 clutch in Spike Rush! I also trolled with Sage's wall against Viper and got kills+retreated. Learned how to reposition and run from engagements quickly.

3. Swam 48 laps with a sprint. Cut my hair afterwards.
