# Dave Compliments My Writing, Morning Grind, Sushi, Studying Stacks
Monday, September 28, 2020

5:47 PM

Woke up early today and had a wonderful workout, jumping rope for several minutes and completing 2 Math 230 lectures, realizing how states in Turing Machines worked, etc. Afterwards, I had class with CS201 and English 11.

 

Sushi with the Gays Hopper Squad. It was delicious and so light! I was quite pleased by the taste and the walk to the CEID. On my way back, a package arrived, which I picked up. I also shaved, clipped my nails really nicely, and washed my face.

 

Organized my dock with spacers. The result is a much more organized dock with grouped applications?

 

Studied in the stacks with Amelie. We talked about the tea, my dates, and also cleared up that we were friends. I learned quite a bit about her past 3 relationships and hers with Josh. It was a great time but very unproductive (in a good way).

 

Call with the Alexander Hamilton Society. Alex was very prepared and I was surprised by the depth of the conversation.

 

Ate dinner and had delicious lamb burgers and sweet potatoes for dinner! It was delicious. I met Alazar while picking up the burgers. Meanwhile I texted Lelan and continued the banter game. I also talked to Flora about Justin and how we're both surprised he hasn't had a relationship yet.

 

Dave Hagler texted me and told me my writing has substantially improved

 

Had a YUDI Finance meeting. Saw Lelan there as well. We talked briefly and had a good time. Afterwards, I visited the HCC meeting and passed on my request to Alex, who said that HCC can review it, then Dean Francis.
