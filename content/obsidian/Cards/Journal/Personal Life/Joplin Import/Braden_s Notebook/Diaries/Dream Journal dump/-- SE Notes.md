SE Notes

 

SE I don't know exactly what I was saying earlier but I realize now that's not exactly what I meant; it's time for me to grow up and stop playing games with my pride.

 

And so I know there's not much to say right now

 

Closure is pretty much as far as it gets

 

And you definitely have other things that are preferable to attend to

 

But I just wanted to clarify that I stop playing too cool now, I told you I liked you because I liked you, period, and it wasn't anything other than getting it off my chest. Awkward as it was though I thought I was trying to say I wasn't hurt but there was just a little pain; I didn't mean I felt badass or anything though, just that I felt good to let it go

 

But anyways

 

I still want to do everything I can from my end as a person which is not much

 

I just wanted you to always know that no matter the weather, the challenge, the circumstances

 

I'll be here

 

As a friend, as a colleague, whatever you call it

 

And if you ever need help with something, I'll be here to support all the way

 

Or if you ever feel like meeting to catch up I'll always be down to listen (more than low-key interested in the heights you'll reach :) )

 

But I know people are busy or have better contacts so in reality just know that whenever you ever feel down

 

I'm going to be here (or somewhere)

 

Rooting for you

 

Maybe going through stuff too

 

But I know everything will end up alright :)

 

And though I won't be forgetting you anytime soon

 

It's in a good way, for changing my life in so many ways for the better and making me grow and continue growing as a person

 

I've grown so much this past week and hopefully that translates to an extra inch or two haha

 

OF HEIGHT OMG

 

That's it I'm done

 

But yeah don't know how I can communicate this properly but in summary though sometimes it hurts just a bit life goes on and I wish you the best and only the best, and know that I'm always willing to be friends (only if you can tolerate it lol), and that I'm willing to help you out anytime because I don't know how else to be helpful lol

 

Thanks for being patient with me and hope I didn't embarrass you much, lmk anything that is on your chest cuz I've gotten pretty good at empathy and in the end I'm never hurt by honesty &lt;3
