# The Boys, Called Grandpa, Swam
The Boys, Called Grandpa, Swam

Today, I finished Season 1 of the Boys. It was epic! Homelander was an amazing antagonist, with an ending episode that was absolutely spectacular. The twist in the leverage of the blackmail, Hugh and Starlight's relationship, as well as the change in motives for Butcher, was an amazing end.
 
I called Grandpa to thank him for the birthday check. Very grateful for everything he has done.
 
Also started my first AoPS Math Transcript. Swam with Bryce for 50 laps.
