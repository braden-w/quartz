I found today's set of articles very intriguing. In general, I believe GiveDirectly to be my preferred charity, in part to this Chinese proverb:

 

“When there is food on the table there are many problems. When there is no food on the table there is one problem”.

 

I found the flexibility offered to beneficiaries to prioritize which immediate problem to solve to be quite enticing, as well as the low burden of proof. Many charities seem to choose a specific problem subset in advance, which while efficient, may not be effective.

 

My second choice would be the LLIN's under the Against Malaria Foundation, which suffers from this aforementioned problem of focusing on a problem subset. Malaria nets have been used for fishing, which pollutes water and targets young undeveloped fry. When hunger is an issue, these nets are not being used for their proper purpose.
