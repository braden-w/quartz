# FCC Mixer, Meeting Kevin
Sunday, October 11, 2020

1:43 AM

 

Had a delicious breakfast yogurt parfait. Met Donna and Bill. Got three of those parfaits because they were so delicious!

 

FCC Mixer Event. Met Matt, Leleda, and more! First, we characterized all the residential colleges, but then ended up just talking in the other three groups. Group 1 was elite! It was a great time to talk to Grayson and Matt in particular; I hope to meet them in Pauli Murray and Pierson sometime.

 

Afterwards, I ran over to Dwight Hall to complete my test. I met a lady who asked me my name and got excited, because she knew someone named Brandon Wong! I explained her my story with Brandon Wong from AHS, and she enjoyed it. She then asked for my birthday and I said July 12. She was so surprised, because she was July 13! We were both cancers. Feeling taller.

 

Had an energy drink and toast crunch while grinding away Philosophy paper. Kept on working on that paper until later that night, when I submitted it.

 

Projector and Movie. Ate a DELICIOUS Korean fried chicken that I thought would be quite bad but was incredibly pleasantly surprised. Met this person named Hailey from Long Island. Talked to Aaron and Mitchell and we got the projector cleared for NBA Finals tomorrow night!
