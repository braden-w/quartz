Reflections of the Passing of the Koi Fish Pond

There is still some pain in my reflection of yesterday’s course of events. To have watched the fish slowly suffer and endure an excruciating death by asphyxiation was not pleasant. However, the experience was in some way, cathartic, and additionally, a precursor to the suffering that is to come. There is no need to overreact in the death of others. Life is suffering ,and in recognizing that fact, one becomes incredibly at peace with one’s existence in the first place. I am grateful to have endured such an experience during this period of my life, for it will prepare me for the inevitable heartache that may come later.
