# AACC Meeting
Friday, November 6, 2020

8:30 PM

 

Had a call with AACC Speed Friending. Hedy and Eddie as Twins. Eddie and Hedy. That was quite hilarious. Charles and Mary. Talking during the AACC meeting was quite enjoyable. Meeting Eddie, an RSI participant who met Ben Liu from Arcadia, was also interesting. It helps me feel that community has been fostered even though it's been a rough set of weeks.

 

Duty night. Talked with FROCOS as they played Settlers of Katan and with David about some tips on CS Homework.
