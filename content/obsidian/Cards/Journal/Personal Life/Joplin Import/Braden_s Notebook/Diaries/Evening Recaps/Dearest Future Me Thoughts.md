Dearest Future Me Thoughts

Â 

What is this piece about? This piece follows the evolution of a man who struggles to find inspiration in the mundane, and must remind himself and reassert himself in times of struggle. What makes this compelling, though? This speaker has a unique background. When the bullies hit, and you cry? When you've argued with your mother again, not about food or girls but about how to get the latest culture shock. I am grateful to write about a dear future me article with the greatest emphasis of all of personal perserverence. Most notably, at the moment, the concern I have is of how to cultivate a distinct identity for each piece. Dear Future Me is to evoke a sense of pity and grandeur and amazement as we talk about the truth of the simplicities of life, trying desperately to become better. What can I talk about? I can talk about being an immigrant, but that has already been covered. I can talk about being bullied, and that also has been covered. I can talk about what it takes to be a better student, but I am not sure exactly to what extent is needed. When was I most discouraged? I compare the spikes of everyone and create a superbody.
