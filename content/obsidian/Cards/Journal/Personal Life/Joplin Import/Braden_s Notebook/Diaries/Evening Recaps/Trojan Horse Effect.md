Trojan Horse Effect

The goal of this investigation is to investigate and potentially provide recommendations for "the trojan horse" effect of Coronavirus. By Trojan horse effect, I am referring to the tendency for individuals to act with a greater degree of recklessness when wearing protective equipment, such as a mask, that leads to further spreading of the disease. This effect is often observed in daily life. For example, I have observed that several individuals in my community, once wearing a mask, break the 6 feet social distancing rule and even touch others in interactions. The same may be said once wearing gloves. Furthermore, some individuals fidget when wearing protective equipment in a manner that compromises the integrity of said equipment. While protective equipment is incredibly important, this investigation will attempt to find behavioral changes that may increase chances of passing infection between individuals, and whether or not, or to what extent, wearing protective gear is protective.

 

How does education play a role in preventing disease clusters? What are preventative measures that can enhance the effectiveness of protective equipment? How much does protective equipment lower chances of infection? Is protective equipment better suited in the hands of health professionals?

 

There are many possible questions that this study could answer. The purpose is to investigate the implications and insights these answers may bring. The biggest problem that this study ideally solves is the proper allocation of resources, should scarcity apply, and the best practices when wearing protective equipment, as well as the proper message to be sent to the public regarding practices. The message "wear a mask" may not be a proper deterrent, and in fact may be exacerbating contact and transmission between individuals. After the study is conducted, recommendations should be made to the government and individuals on the best practices, both in interpersonal reaction and signaling messages to the public.

 

My uncle is a working dentist and recently sent in a request to the California government with a packet regarding this effect. In dentistry, this is a common phenomenon where dentists must keep track of what they touch with their gloves, because cross contamination is arguably easier with gloves on (as you are unable to physically feel if your fingers have been soiled). There are numerous real life social interactions that further add to this. His request has been the inspiration for this potential study.

 

Additionally, as mentioned earlier, this effect is often observed in daily life. For example, I have observed that several individuals in my community, once wearing a mask, break the 6 feet social distancing rule and even touch others in interactions. The same may be said once wearing gloves. Furthermore, some individuals fidget when wearing protective equipment in a manner that compromises the integrity of said equipment. While protective equipment is incredibly important, this investigation will attempt to find behavioral changes that may increase chances of passing infection between individuals, and whether or not, or to what extent, wearing protective gear is protective.

 

As I mentioned earlier in my previous response, it appears that surveying may be the easiest option though a controlled experiment would be ideal. There is a possibility that we can obtain both. The strength of a survey is sheer size of data, while a controlled experiment can help establish causality. Self-reported data may be unreliable, but as mentioned in the course, community data can be incredibly helpful when gathering information for a study. It would be beyond ideal if we could have a method of consentfully tracking contact of individuals through their phone, similar to contact tracing, or a way of obtaining data of interactions of individuals both before and after the outbreak (when the mask rule was enforced). Through this, we would have a large data set to cross-reference and compare both before and after masking and use of other protective equipment was enforced on a public level by the government.

Additionally, establishing a controlled experiment, in comparing interactions of unmasked and masked individuals, is possible albeit not necessarily practical during these times of high contagion.
