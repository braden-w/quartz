Back at it again! Today's post will be focused on gratitude and my personal ritual as a very stressful week approaches.

 

Next week will be nothing short of a very difficult week. There's a bunch of things that I must complete, from English to French to History to College Apps. And yet, the fruits of my labors will be yielded at the end of the week. I am nervous about the whole Scholastics situation, yes, but will do my best and hope that they accommodate me. This is fate's way of making sure that I am always tested, and my boundaries are strengthened.

 

My personal values are focused on always pushing boundaries. My plans for the AMC 12 is because I value math and my academic performance. I value pushing boundaries, being the best, and following my own study plans.

 

Perhaps right now I am in a rut. But once I get back onto the grind, I will be all set. Getting back onto Toggl, Pomodoros, working in Starbucks, and getting the best of the best performance I can. Today's writing is the best of the best from Braden Wong.

 

Next week as dead week is also a topic of concern. There are so many different finals, and so much to study, but the only thing I need to do is START. Start working hard. Start getting better. Start being the best I can be. My grade is in balance, and this is a topic that is ultimately just so very exciting! I can do my best to calculate the amount of time to finish things up. Please excuse me as I do so right now.

 

The calculations reveal there is still enough for me to pursue my current schedule, thank goodness. Then please allow me to do so, wholeheartedly, in this quest. Let me be well rested and strong as I search for meaning. May I receive mercy for my blunders and gather the strength and assassin mentality to pursue success with grit.

 

Planning is incredibly nerverwracking and the pressure to succeed may be great, but I have faith in myself. There is hope for me as I plan all of these to be the very best of the best. But to be the best is to do my best, and to invest the strength necessary to succeed. That's quite a big commitment but one I'm willing to take. There is too much on the line and at stake for me to not try do my best and be the best. There is no too much, however. I am never going to run out of willpower or strength to do what is necessary to succeed. What must I do to succeed, however? What sacrifices must I do in order to maintain superiority? Is superiority worth maintaining? These are the questions that I ask myself endlessly in this quest for knowledge. Typing is therapeutic because it reminds me that there is much to complete in order to further this quest.
