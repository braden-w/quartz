# Daily_Note/Entries
1. Breakfast. Oatmeal was so delicious! Nice brown sugar, fruits, and nuts
2. Big Fat Nap. 90 minutes. Visualized that I am 6 ft and I slept like a baby.
3. Lunch with Shreya and Alex.
 1. Discussed the economic problem
 2. Carnegie endowment of international peace
 3. 2NK sent the Zoom meme
1. Dinner: Pasta
 1. Comrade Alex as a preferred pronoun in 500 person zoom
 2. Easy languages: all the jocks are taking Indonesian and Czech and Zulu since the grading curve is incredibly easy
  1. Imagine a party where the boys talk to each other in other languages
 1. Going out with ma boi Jack to approach Amelie
  1. I realized after he specified which group he wanted to hit up that it was Amelie's group and I was like :O
  2. Jack introduced me and it was awkward because I already knew them
  3. I did my best to hype up Jack and left early to give him a 1-on-1 shot
  4. Dm'ed him and made sure we're cool with the situation. He'll dm me if he drops the ball and the coast is clear.
1. Called mom and dad and discussed that situation.
2. Call with Froco. Shared my fun fact about drinking the Kool-Aid
3. Call with Duty. Extra 1-on-1 time with Kathryn and Amber, talking about clubs, extracurriculars, and classes. Also helped Gabe with CS201 HW
