In the past two days, I've got a bunch of sleep and proved my conversational abilities.

 

1. Call with E Young for Yale Board. Since I recently completed my Yale Oxford application, I spoke about my personal opinion of EA's pitfalls and the scarcity mindset (focused on the neglectedness). She was incredibly impressed. She said that I would be very good for "grabbing a plate with", the term for deep conversations with Yale undergrads.

2. Slept 11 hours that night. Took a nap for 2 hours in the afternoon. Very refreshing!

3. Drove my way to Yearbook pickup and had a nice chat with Dad. I heard a story about siphoning gas, which was incredibly funny and also something to be concerned about.

4. Watching headphone videos and intro to audiophile equipment

5. Played a bunch of piano!

6. Pulled the trigger on the headphones

7. Played a lot of CS and Aim Trainer to get my perfect sens. Get back to 1.06

8. Completed Weeks 4 and 5 of Coursera
