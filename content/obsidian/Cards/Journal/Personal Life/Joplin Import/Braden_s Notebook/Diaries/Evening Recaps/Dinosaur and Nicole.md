Dinosaur and Nicole

A beautiful dream today. First, there was a dinosaur invasion. A runner dodged death through playing peakaboo around a building, running circles around the building, and then being cornered by the dinosaur. He/she sprinted to the side right as the dinosaur lunged, and it crashed into the building a died. Suddenly, I teleported down to the ground and ran with a bunch of smaller humans. As an enormous giant, I was tasked of protecting the humans, picking up cars and dinosaurs behind us and stalling them. However, they barely budged with each throw. I then transformed to normal size and was chased by secret agents. I threw everything I could, then dream ended.

 

I teleported into a bus with Nicole. With an arm/hug over her, everything came flooding back to me. It was a beautiful moment. She was all smiles and happy and we leaned on each other. The experience was wholesome. I felt transported to a different era, one that I hope to return to someday in the future.

 

And thus, the journey begins. I am currently brainwriting whatever is on my mind in search of uncovering the gems of my mind. One of the biggest things I am dreaming about are relationships. What purpose do relationships serve in today's world? When I am more than content with my own life, it seems that relationships are an opportunity to share this joy with others, rather than to receive joy myself. Upon this meditation I must find myself relieved to know that there is no pressure for me to somehow live to this expectation that I have to make others happy or not. It is rather to find a person that fits into my lifestyle and who I wish to exercise a near monopoly over or sole ownership, because they are so precious to my existence. I am attracted to the types of Nicole, who are of a very flirtacious enthusiastic bunch. Happiness bleeds inescapably into my daily life thinking of the memories we have created together. More importantly is to recognize what I may do to enhance other people's experiences. That is the goal of today's ponderance. I am a man more than capable of handling myself on my own, and whether or not others wish to invest in my future is not my decision. But it is my decision whether or not I wish to invest in theirs.

 

Analyzing my dreams. In terms of Nicole, it is clear that I have a desire for a happiness that I find otherwise lacking in my life (relatively speaking, of course). In addition, there is definitely no reason for me to feel upset by the recent course of events in school or life, but to feel excited that my future is to be decided in the near future. The invasion of dinosaurs is a strange enthrilling experience that at the moment felt extremely uncomfortable and scary.

 

What does it mean to be a good citizen? This is a question I must ponder over from the Elks Lodge scholarship. If I am a good citizen and beacon to my community, is my attempt to be generous genuine? Or am I playing a façade? I do want to help others, but in part because I know helping them helps myself. To help others elevates one's reputation and status, and demonstrates that they have enough on their plate to be able to share and give to others. That is a sign of strength rather than weakness. In otherways, this view could be selfish. It is easy to justify one's desire for self-propulsion to be strictly selfish and self-serving. But that is not necessarily the case for me. I derive just as much enjoyment from seeing others respond to my knowledge and stories as I do improving myself or reading those of others. The exchange of ideas and flow of information is something that is universally celebrated in this era. However, am I truly deserving of such an honor? Do I have the willingness to do what it takes to cook a startup in the heat of battle? These are questions that I ponder nightly. There is no correct answer to these questions. I very well might be curtailing my own progress by trying to convince myself of a narrative that I must help others. I don't.

 

But that is the exact reason why I should. It is because helping others is not a social norm or expectation that is precisely why I should pursue it. This is the manners in which I regard myself. I am a hero not simply because I just want to do the right thing, but that I believe unequivocably that doing the right thing will always be in my best interest. Perhaps that is a selfish regard but it is the truest and steadiest form of generosity. Whereas others may be exhaused in the mundane drudgery of serving others with no meaning, I shall take as prodigious a leap as to claim that I am surely one to be generous for my own benefit and serve others forever.

 

I do hope that the Elks may be able to see this passion in my application. However, ultimately, it is not my decision, but theirs, who they wish to pick. I do hope for the best. Good luck, Braden.
