HILARIOUS Grand Tour Episode with Jeremy Clarkson's Adventures with the Citroen. Among the tests were:
 
Is it faster than itself?
Can it tow a 13,000 ton boat?
Can it fit Angelina Jolie's children?
Can it fit a disabled child's wheelchair?
Can it fit a horse?
 
Episode 10
Hammond Stunts
May Unboxing
Clarkson Detective Souffle
I laughed SO MUCH with Bryce when watching this video!!
 
Afterwards, I had a talk with dad. Our tenant having taken advantage of us, I had many things to say and we spent a good deal of time discussing about people, the government, etc.
Gen Z is very like Boomers
We were born in a war (we have known war all our life)
Protests everywhere
From trough to peak, not peak to trough like Millenials
 
Finally, my MacBook Pro 16 came in! Unboxed and it is absolutely beautiful! I'll be setting it up tomorrow.
