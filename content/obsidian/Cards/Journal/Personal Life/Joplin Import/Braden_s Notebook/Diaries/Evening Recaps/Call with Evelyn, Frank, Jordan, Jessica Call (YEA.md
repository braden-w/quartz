Today was an incredible day of calls! After an amazing delivery during our EA call on factory farming, "Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional", the unintended consequences of decreasing demand, and is it an evolutionary win to be factory farmed?

 

Afterwards, a call with Jessica was quite illuminating. She offered housing at the YEA house as an alternative this upcoming semester.

 

Finally, a call with Evelyn and Frank covering a whole sort of topics. Among them were politics and AI. I shared with them some great YouTube channels and concerns about race, technology, geopolitics, etc.
