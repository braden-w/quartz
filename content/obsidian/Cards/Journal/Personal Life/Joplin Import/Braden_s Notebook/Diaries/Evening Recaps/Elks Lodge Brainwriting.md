Elks Lodge Brainwriting

What would make me happy today? Quite a bit. As I profusely dump ideas from my mind and believe in what would make me satisfied, I have a growing list of priorities to tackle for the rest of the week. First and foremost, the Elks Lodge application has occupied a significant portion of my mental bandwidth, to which I am sure a great application is cooking. I will focus on making the application about others, not just myself. My biggest decision is where to cut and not mention my resume of failures/losses and early wakeups, or if I should keep them. In summary, I should just not worry so much about the application and all will be well. In this regard, it is much easier to maintain a sane head when there is no overhead fear of whether or not an omitted detail would benefit my application. The purpose that I am trying to convey is that I am an applicant which truly cares about others, not just about myself. And in this regard it may be worth my time to refrain from bragging too much on what I have accomplished or am prideful of; the actual focus should be on the people I impact in spite of this productivity. I am perfectly capable of holding my own on either angle. Thus, my main priority is to demonstrate that I am a man who possesses both heart and intellect, an irrefutable fact in its own regard and certainly for the Braden Wong.
