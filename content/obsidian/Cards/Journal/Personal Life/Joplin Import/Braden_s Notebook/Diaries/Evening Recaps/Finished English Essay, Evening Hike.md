# Finished English Essay, Evening Hike
Finally finished my English essay! Wrapped it up during the 201 lecture and was quite pleased with the result that I got out of it. Was a great vibe and excited that I was able to pull it off! Emailed that and was quite relieved to pull it off. I am now ready to tackle the rest of my list, which I am incredibly excited to do.

Had lunch with Effective Altruism. We walked together to the EA House and I was able to play Beat Saber on McKinsey's VR Set. It was a great experience! A lot of fun and played two songs. Afterwards, I completed 4 problems on the CS201 pset, making good progress on the Psets.

Evening hike with Gays Hopper. It was an absolutely surreal sunset! It was so beautiful and wholesome as we congregated around in a circle and talked. The sun set and we had so many laughs along the way. Afterwards, we bought and picked up cookie dough and ate it along the way. On the way back, we sung a bunch of songs together.

Then, I went out with Shreya, Andres, Gabe,Dante, etc.. We visited Taco Bell and then came back to Bookworld, where I met Justin. We bugged out and then embarked on an adventure to find Gabe and bring him back to the suite. In my room, there were like 15 bags on the floor left over from my breakfasts/math psets.

Tea party in the suite. Everyone sung along to some songs, we discussed our lives, and overall had a great time. It was so wholesome and we definitely enjoyed ourselves.
