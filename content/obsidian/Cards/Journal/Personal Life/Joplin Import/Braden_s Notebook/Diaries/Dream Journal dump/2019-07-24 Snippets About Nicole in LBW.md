NICOLE

I've been having so much fun! but time flew and we only have a week left so I should tell u

lately I've been missing you and the time we spent together-those were some of the best memories I've ever made!

u honestly make me just so happy and I want to treat u right; share some back and make some new experiences (:

would u like to meet later this week and play again, bestie? â˜º

 Oof yesterday was a rough day

Omg you remembered! thank you so much bestie ^v^ I'm not the best texter but I need to say

Thank you for showing me that there are happy intelligent beautiful people in this world. You have a genuine happiness that is just infectious and I can't help but smile remembering our moments. I just genuinely enjoy talking with someone is like me

If I did I didn't intend to come across as melodramatic but thank u for being there for me just to talk and make me feel better

When I grow up and go to college here I'll look for you
