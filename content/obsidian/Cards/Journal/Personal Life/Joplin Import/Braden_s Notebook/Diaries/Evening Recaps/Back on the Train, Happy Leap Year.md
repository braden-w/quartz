Happy leap year! This is a cheers to my dreams, and having reformed my system to habits over dailies in Habitica, and reading more frequently. I am sleeping much better, and I am in the process of an immense transformation/self-betterminet. I am grateful for this opportunity to have freedom over my life, to understand what a gap year is like and to invest in myself. Three big things to focus on: reading comprension, writing ability, and programming ability. The biggest thing to finish today is my homework and all preparation for my activities next week. 80/20 activities that are worth my time: SAT Comprehension, Writing Daily, Reading Fiction, and Programming Python Projects. I will finish Udemy's Python Course, FreeCodeCamp, and finally, CS50. My values are to do small things that have an enormous impact on my future. That is what I will strive to do, always.
