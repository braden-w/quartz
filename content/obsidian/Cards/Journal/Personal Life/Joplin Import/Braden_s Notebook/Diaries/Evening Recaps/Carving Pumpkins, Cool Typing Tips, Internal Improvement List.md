# Carving Pumpkins, Cool Typing Tips, Internal Improvement List
Sunday, October 25, 2020

Texted Nina and Vanessa and got it all cleared up! I will hopefully do my best to be honest and kind to them.

Carving pumpkins in the courtyard.

Typing tips. Visualize words as chords and type them as such. Instead of typing super fluidly like I do, this helps set my brain in the right mood.

Shared my internal improvements list with Hopper.

Dinner in the buttery. Madison's hair dye bag was left in the shower, and her roommate thought it was a bag of blood in shower

Kevin told me that he saw my resume and really liked it! It was clean.

Helped Bryce out with a Math Calculus problem. It was a trough and I really felt good! My 230 knowledge has definitely helped me out in understanding how to solve these problems.
