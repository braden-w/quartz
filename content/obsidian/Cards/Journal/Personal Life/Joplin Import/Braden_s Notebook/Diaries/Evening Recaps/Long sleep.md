# Long Sleep
Monday, November 9, 2020

4:29 PM

 

1. Slept almost 11 hours! Slept from 4AM to 10AM which was a super long time to be in bed. Lots of dreams that night too.

2. Had a great call with Lincoln and the Gettysberg address. Got my paper back, a B+/Aand taught me that argumentation is more important than style. Working on the paper throughout the day.

3. More of The Onion binge. It was HILARIOUS! Enjoyed the talk shows that go awry and the headlines with the Mike from Medschool. He also did one vs. Legal Eagle on which is better: Med or Law school.

4. Had a quick call with YUDI about finance with Goldman Sachs. This helped teach me that finance may not exactly be my thing, but I will keep my options open.

5. Call with Andre. We talked about what to do when we don't vibe with people, time fixes relationships, when people are special, having a type vs. not a type.

	1. You can be skeptical while being open-minded. Skeptical and close-minded are not mutually exclusive.

	2. Validation. That other people are on the same boat. Honestly, that is the best part of talking about it.

1. Sent out the YCC Fall Survey, which was the following:

	1. Hey guys, hope quarantine has been treating you well! Just wanted to drop the YCC Fall Survey below—feel free to fill it out whenever you have a hot minute (and a chance to win an Amazon gift card). YCC has policy committees who would like to advocate changes to the Yale administration and would like your voice to be heard. Let us know about your opinion on modifying days off, mental healthcare, COVID, zoom fatigue, general wellness, and more. It's also an opportunity to vent and let us know how you're feeling :)
