Â 

1. Learned Sova Arrows on Ascent and Haven from Sinatraa. Good use of time. Remembered using them once I did it myself. Really important to apply concepts to remember the context to use it.

2. DM Showdown with Bryce. Dmed in CS:GO, went positive and had a really great play in door Cache.

3. Later that night, we switched back to our respective games. I played DM.

	1. In the end, I hit a nutty 3K through mid connector on Ascent. Killed two in cat with clean headshots, then turned around to kill a Brimstone. Top fragged and won that game. It was super good.
