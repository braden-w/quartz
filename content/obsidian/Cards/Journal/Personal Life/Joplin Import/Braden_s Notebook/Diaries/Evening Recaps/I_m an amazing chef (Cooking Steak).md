A great day of cooking steak and discovering my ability to be a chef!

 

1. Cooked T-Bone steak with butter. Delicious! Mom added the butter before the bone was done cooking at first (which Bryce and I found hilarious), citing that she was "following my directions" and that I had no common sense. LOL To rescue it, I realized I should cook all the cubes, take them out, then put the bones in (because they can't all fit together), then put everything back to put butter in. Afterwards, we tried some and it was DELICIOUS. Dad really liked it. The butter really heightened the steak to a new limit.

2. Killing Floor hacking. I started spam firing desert. Skrake rounds were EZ. Bryce shredded through the bosses

3. Played Valorant games. Ended up playing 5 due to constant surrenders. Did pretty good but lost all 5 LOL

4. Algorithmic Toolbox meeting. FIRE.

	1. Me: "We tend to project our insecurities in our questions" Alecia: "I got into Yale and MIT, and I chose MIT"

	2. Life advice. Suffering together. Russian culture: suffering together. Higher suicide rate in happier countries, not saddest countries.

	3. Hedonic treadmill/hedonic adaptation

	4. Set Context:: Separate work from play, get accountability buddies

You are much more likely to let yourself down than someone else

5. Rotary Meeting. Introduced myself to rotary and my interests. Scarcity mindset. Received plaque with Adam and Jenny
