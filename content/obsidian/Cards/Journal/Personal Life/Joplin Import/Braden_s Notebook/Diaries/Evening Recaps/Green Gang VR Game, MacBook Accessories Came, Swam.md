# Green Gang VR Game, MacBook Accessories Came, Swam
Green Gang VR Game, MacBook Accessories Came, Swam…

PM

 

Watched an amazing video set with Bryce on VR with the Green Gang! Their skits were hilarious, especially the one where one of them slaps the other on the ass and there was an awkward silence. After that, I continued to swim at the Power's house for about an hour (132 laps)!

 

During today, I have been setting up my MacBook. Ever since the accessories arrived, I was able to set up the monitor and peripherals to make it super streamlined.

 

Later that night, I called William Pan and we played Minecraft while discussing life.
