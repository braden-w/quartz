# Organized Onedrive, Remnote_OneNote, and Finished
Organized Onedrive, Remnote/OneNote, and Finished …

PM

 

An amazing day of clearing out all the junk to allow me to focus ahead.

 

1. Watched funny memes with Bryce, the wireless mouse in an AC outlet and the two traps were hilarious!

2. Cleared OneDrive and Google Drive Backups

3. Organized Remnote and OneNote. OneNote is a dedicated journal for record keeping and remnote is for all things idea related.
