On Christmas Eve 1914, soldiers from both sides of the trenches came together. As they played, laughed, and sang songs together, a glimpse of peace could be seen in a long and terrible war.

 

We are all human, protesters and police officers alike. They have families, fears, and problems, just like the rest of us.

 

This isn't an excuse for either side to self-justify. It is a reason for both sides to show compassion.

 

Challenge will unite us, not divide us.
