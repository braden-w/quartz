The search for great immigrant writing continues. I am typing vigorously on the keyboard when she falls. My thoughts race as I try to recall what happened. I am utterly confused. I am disgusted. How could she leave? They say it was a stroke of fate. If that's true, then screw fate. Don't take away Grandma from me, please. But as I look at the note, all is forgotten.

 

There is only gratitude, flowing in English. My grandparents forgot all their Chinese when their parents died. I wonder what that means?

 

I emerged from the womb with a smile. At least , that is what my parents told me. And so I say everything with a smile veiled behind them.

 

And so while my friends marvel how they forget their mother tongues, I only coyly smile and watch from a distance. There are more things to life than culture, I think.

 

Ten years ago, my bullies would bully me endlesssly. Ethan's lunch box smacks my head. It's not the first time this has happened. For some recesses, I would only walk around with my friend and talk about science and technology. He wasn't ostracized for his language, of course. Timothy spoke Chinese. He was just a nerd. And that was something that united us.

 

Ten years later, there are no bullies. For one, the bullies themselves are forgetting Chinese. The roots so inescapably attafhed to their parents have left them, and there is nothing left. They pride themselives in being American, and I just smilie. That's the spirit, I say.

 

When there is nothing but truth and vague recollections in this mess, I am simply done. A World with No Boundaries? Is the solution to all of our problems. There is a faint love for what I have to offer to the bullies.

 

I hop into the car, smiling. Grandpa is here, and we talik. I had just spent the entire day writing about Grandma. Grandma is confned to a bed. It's going to be a while until she ever becomes mobile again.

 

There is something so wonderful. Silence weighs over in a heavy blanket. I am appalled.

 

We know what is coming. Fate, with its stroke of luck, had reminded us now what would happen in a few years. Nobody talks about Grandma. We know what is huappening.

 

I am at peace with the passing. There is something so oddly amazing in fioguring out exactly what to do, oozing voice and making sure that these words find a place somewher

 

Heaping loads of turkey and stuffing and beans and soup and gravy and cranberry sauce. It feels like more food than ever before. I know that this dinner, we will scarf it voraciously. There will be little talk in between the muffled bites of blisss. Grandpa will finish first.

 

"Okay, now who would like to say grace?" my father says enthusiastically, as custom. I volunteer in response.

 

I love my life. My prents and grandparents love me, and there is food always on the table. The amount of arguing is nothing compared to other families. The only conflicts that ever happen are with the external, or perhaps with an ocassional aunt or uncle.

 

I bow my head for prayer, but I stumble upon my words. I can't think of anything to say.

 

Among all of the wonderful fruits of this world, the only one that you need to concern yourself with is the raspberries.

Four memoirs is an exhausing number. Sprinkling in two humors, and a poem, and science fiction might make it worth it. It depends. Let's analyze. So we'll have a personal memoir introduction up next, and then after that perhaps a humor or poem to talk about how thankful you are. Then we have the interlude, Remember Me, Honeybunch. There is something oddly remarkable about both of these pieces. We can then talk about the interlude, which is the poem or memoir about what it is supposed to happen. The immigrant's struggle, and how to make it all work out in the end. There's something about that which makes it worth it, or perhaps not. I'm not sure, it's a gamble. However, the ending is quite priceless. Talking about Thanksgiving both times is great. You can talk about Thanksgiving \#1, then give thanks, then Remember Honeybunch, then Poem, then Immigrant's song, then Spork, then Let it Happen, then Humor, then finally the end of it all, the capstone. We end with the final Thanksgiving, which would make sense. I have a lot more writing toi do! Oh, but I guess this is not too bad, for it is a freeform writing and expression ofhow I feel, and nothing short. Watching mom's Chinese drama, while she makes joke and I reflect deliciously about the nights before, is a great feeling. I am but thankful and grateful, and I hope that this confidence exudes in my writing and that I am joyous and happy. There is but no concern, no negative emotion masked in these times, but instead a simple love for what is to come. I wriggle my toes in my little croc slippers, their insole support helping out so much. There is something so profoundly religious too. I want to mae sure it is expressed that I believe God. I am listening to Ace Combat soundtrafck, which is amazing to listen too. The background music helps stimulate my thoughts as I dream about what is to come later today. The ideas, the tutoriing, the help. I am nothing but grateful for that. After this rant, I must organize and decide WHICH 8 I will do, for if I do not I will be in some difficulty technically speaking. There is something for everyone to do. My mother is fully supportive of my endeavors, however, which is wonderful. I am very happy to have this opportunity to write about my thoughts and just braindump. This orchestral music is music to my ears, and helping me breath and understand my emotions. Time to clean up!
