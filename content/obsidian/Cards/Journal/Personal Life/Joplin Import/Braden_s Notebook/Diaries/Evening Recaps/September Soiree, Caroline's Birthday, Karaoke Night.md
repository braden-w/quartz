# September Soiree, Caroline's Birthday, Karaoke Night
Sunday, September 27, 2020

8:29 AM

Woke up late and had a great breakfast of Keesh with a juicy sausage and squash. The buttery was also open from 1-3 PM in the courtyard, so I grabbed some food and mozzarella sticks. I talked to Isabelle briefly since we were in the line together. Otherwise, a simple breakfast hanging out with Akeel, Kevin, Andrew, and Shervin and tennis players at the side. We talked briefly about the previous night.

Grinded out Math 230 Psets with the squad. We ended up completing problem 1a, 2, and 4. It was pretty sweet!

After the long grind, it was time to go to the September Soiree! I showered and got ready, put on a polo and debated which pair of pants to put on. During the Soiree, we did the Cotton Eyed Joe and some basic line dancing. Some nice hanging out and grooving, as well as talking and pictures with the gang. People dressed well and it was really nice to see! At the very end, we grabbed chicken tenders, brownies, etc. from the back.

After the Soiree, I went down to the buttery with Akeel and Aaron and had a great time talking and just chatting. I talked a lot with David afterwards, hanging out, and then hung out with Justin's group in the courtyard.

Afterwards, we departed. Caroline's birthday party had a special cake which costed a lot of money and had Dragonfruit in it. It was so delicious! Kevin, Andrew, and the gang came and we all had a great time.

Afterwards, I went to Morse to crash their Karaoke party with Hopper Squad. We had an absolute blast! We sung Payphone by Maroon 5 with the boys, Kevin did a great job with that and even did the rap part! Gabe sung ride by 21 Pilots, which was hilarious. During the event, I met Lelan and we had some great banter. It all started with charging my phone, and afterwards we talked about our backstories, our parents (also from Sichuan), debate, and a few other topics. I had a lot of fun singing along with our Grace Hopper group. We were definitely the life of the party.

At the end, I walked around a short while with Vanessa. I was absolutely pooped and thankfully she was very accommodating. I texted her about this and we may meet in the future when her schedule opens up.
