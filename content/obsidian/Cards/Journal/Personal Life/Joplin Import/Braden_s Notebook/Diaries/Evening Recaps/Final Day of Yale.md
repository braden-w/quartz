Saturday, November 21, 2020

5:30 AM

 

1. Fantastic weather! It was an ideal day to spend time at Yale. Josh and Carson accidentally walked into the PHC through our emergency door LOL.

2. PHC
	> Great philosophical discussion about

3. Went out with Akeel to Popeyes. Afterwards, we hung out in our suite and I drank a few screws. Then, we headed to the buttery and played some ping pong.

4. Visited Pierson

5. The buttery door was unlocked, by some twist of fate.

6. Played Ping Pong with Nathan

 

1. Final goodbyes. Emotional hugs. Josh came in just in time and we had a group suitemate hug. Love is a bitch played in the car.

 

1. Met Derek from Amherst. Slept right after takeoff and before landing. Nice talking with the flight attendant and jamming to my music.

 
Arrived at home. Showered, ate some spice, and a turkey sandwich. Mom and I had a laugh about my paper bags and utensils saved.
 
Talked with Bryce after he came from alpha. Turned on my computer after dad switched the outlets.
 
Took a nap from 3 to 7. Woke up and ate steak and corn, which was delicious.
 
Grabbed some sushi with Akeel at the CEID. Great philosophical discussion about noodles during lunch. We talked about how they had to be thick or thin, not in between. After that, we helped Rayyan pack. There was so much stuff that it took 5 people two trips. Everyone thought that we were leaving LOL. Finally, we went to the bookstore with Nathan, Akeel, and Gabe.
 
Ate dinner with Gays Hopper and Shervin. The buttery door was unlocked, by some twist of fate. Shervin and I talked, plans about pizza party that night, and general plans for the rest of the year. We swung Shervin around by his arms, and also he talked about COVID.
 
Visited Pierson briefly. Said hi to Pierson group (whom I haven't seen since Halloween) and made some goodbyes. We hung out in Nina's suite as she packed up and I said goodbye to Kevin, Edmond, etc..
 
Emotional hugs. Josh came in just in time and we had a group suitemate hug. Love is a bitch played in the car.
 
Holy crap was my plane ride enjoyable. I got my midterm back from CS, and I got a 94.5!
