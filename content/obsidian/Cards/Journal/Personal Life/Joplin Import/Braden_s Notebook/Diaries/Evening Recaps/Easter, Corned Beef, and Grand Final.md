What a wonderful time ot be alive! I am filled with ideas for my new blog. In particular, I am excited and grateful for all the ideas that are spilling over from last night. Today, I am watching the grandfinal with my brother and it was EPIC! Fnatic Flusha scored a double knife against Mousesports and the pistol round nade knife round on Mirage was so chaotic and fun to watch. Bryce and I also flossed together in Mom and Dad's bathroom after eating corned beef for lunch.
