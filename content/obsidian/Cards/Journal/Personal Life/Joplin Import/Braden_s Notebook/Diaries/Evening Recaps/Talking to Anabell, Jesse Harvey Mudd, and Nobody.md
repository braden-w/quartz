Talking to Anabell, Jesse Harvey Mudd, and Nobody in STEM Getting Colleges

Several dreams last night but I do not recall. Waking up, I was very surprised to hear my mother speaking about Jesse's committing to Harvey-Mudd. What a legend. I am Yale bound. Grateful for this 2nd monitor setup that is beyond my table, giving me more room on my desk. Three big things to tackle today are to finish all my habits, clear pocket, and clear all past dailies in Todoist. 80/20 activity? Reading. I value learning and extracting the 80% from the 20%.

 

Among the greatest priorities in recent days have been to keep consistent to a habit. Great conversation today with Anabell about UChicago. We bantered back and forth about each other's college choices, reading, and colleges of other people. Among my realizations was the fact that none of my friends in STEM were admitted in top universities this year. It has, indeed, been an incredibly interesting year.

 

I have been taking several L's in recent days but they do not leave me distraught. I am a $1000 recipient of Elks Lodge, but not Final winner; and am a Finalist for Edison Scholarship, but not winner. It is okay to not always be the winner. I will win when it counts. There are many great long-term goals I have that I will pursue and dedicate myself to.
