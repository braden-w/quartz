Dr. Tung, thank you so much for the wonderful dinner today. I am incredibly grateful for your hospitality, generosity, and every second you have invested in me. The amount of ground we covered is stunning, and I will do my best to put us on a strong trajectory. I look forward to talking with you soon.

 

Mr. Press, I wanted to thank you sincerely for the amazing dinner today. I am in awe of and deeply respect your sacrifices and dedication this first year, and look forward to closely coordinating our classes with you. Hope we can make each other's jobs a little easier along the way :)
