My palms dripped in sweat as I walked through the door, it slamming shut behind me. I grip my pencil nervously, its blue grip squeezed to the core in my nervous fingers. It is Test 4 for Multivariable Calculus, and I am not prepared. I have spent the entire day studying, doing the concept quiz, nervously fretting on what is to come. I had crammed the Divergence Theorem and Stoke's Theorem in the span of 10 minutes before class. As I disembarked the car, fret with nerve, I told my caring father that I wholely expected this test to be my retake in the next week. However, that turned out not to be the case.

 

During the test, I grinded out problems. The teacher had been kind enough to assign problems 5 and 6 and problem 7 and 8 the same problem as pairs, such that their answer matched but methods differed. This was to my great advantage. The divergence theorem aided me in the box problem, while my manual integration of all six sides came in second. It was completely based off intuition: I made the problems up as I went, synthesized the normal vector &lt;0,0,1&gt; and all other 5 directions along the way, based only off faint recollections of the flux formula's normal unit component. That was incredibly impressive. Afterwards, I finished Stoke's theorem based off a vague recollection of tracing the shape in 2D with disregards of the vertical component to solve the line integral. Afterwards, taking the Curl, I parameterized and experimented with the cross product \|r\_r x r\_theta\| until I achieved the desired result. In doing so, I discovered the actually method of Stoke's theorem for the first time. Otherwise, my knowledge of the fundamental theorem of line integrals and Green's theorem carried me through. I did, however, make one minor error on one of my problems regarding Green's theorem. I had written the integral as 2pi rather than pi, leading to a error by a factor of two. Other than that, my answers are all correct.

 

Discussing the test with Jason and Shawn afterwards was amazing. Shawn was incredibly funny as he had ended up with 350 as the answer to BOTH problems even though the answer was actually -150. Further analysis revealed the source was addition rather than subtraction, a rather tragic end. The discussion took place at the whiteboard over a pair of incredibly brilliant fluorescent orange markers. We discussed interviews, his 3-hour promising interview with Harvard, plans for the future, and his own school, Temple City. His characterization of Kevin as a spike was rather amusing to me, as it was delivered quite cheekily. Shawn's ability in science olympiad and physics is truly remarkable. I am glad to have talked to him and earned a great friend today.

 

Having only looked at the practice test once, my academic performance has been nothing but outstanding. It has been my utmost pleasure that I pursued higher learning today in my Multivariable Calculus. Doing so has expanded my educational horizons and demonstrated how creative I can be, not just in the realms of English but STEM as well.
