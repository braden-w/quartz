Today marks one of the greatest realizations I've ever made on economics, and solidified my knowledge and confidence in the subject. Realizing that attributing wage increases to the increase in the factors of production, rather than the increase in income causing demand-pull inflation, was the realization that was finishing blow to the argument. Kevin had a ho

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I was talking with a conservative today at school and there was a great point raised on ubi

 

How do we know ubi will not cause hyperinflation, especially bc that always happens when minimum wage increases? and additionally, if ubi causes people to work less, how is that necessarily a good thing for our gdp

 

so the main assumption with his argument is that people not working is a bad thing, which I contest to a degree. Not working opens them up to opportunities to shop/consume/go out/care for kids/etc. However that's more of a social argument than econ argument (that mental well-being/less overwork is good) and I am not sure how to assert that gdp/output won't be affected if we have fewer people work overtime (sure, they might spend money into the economy but they won't nec. be producing as much output)

 

But I still don't have anything against his inflation argument. If anything I am worried that we will see price inflation on necessity goods, since poor people getting income will increase demand for them, but little effective inflation on luxury goods because ubi does not affect income of rich as much as the poor. That means the poor still end up not being able to afford much stuff

 

I mean I still think ubi serves as an automatic stabilizer and form of wealth distribution, but I am not as sure how it will supercharge the economy if there's inflation. Which is sad bc that is the real reason I like ubi; we already have stabilizers and progressive income tax

 

HOLY SHOOT I GOT IT

 

he attributed the inflation from the wage increases to the increase in disposable income, when in reality inflation was caused by the increase in factors of production

 

ubi only affects disposable income, not factors of production. Which means that demand will increase but supply will not decrease

assuming most necessity goods are in a perfectly elastic market we know that changes in demand don't change price bc supply curve is flat

SO THAT MEANS

yes increasing wages will increase the price of the basket, but increasing income only increases quantity demanded

WE WON BOYS AYY
