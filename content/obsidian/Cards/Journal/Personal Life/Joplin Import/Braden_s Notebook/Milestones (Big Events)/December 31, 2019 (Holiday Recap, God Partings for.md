Holiday recap: it has been a hilarious run. From Michael's failed micro in Bloons Tower Defense 6 to get a Sun God before Round 76, selling a misplaced glue gunner that cost him the game, to Grandpa's mood swings. I am so grateful that we talked to Grandpa after Grandma passed away to placate him. I am overjoyed that he never had to go to that awful place in the shady part of the city. God has aligned the stars for that all to happen. So thank you, Heavenly Father, for this opportunity.

 

God has made light in several strange ways. In many ways, he has parted things in order for me to pursue my destiny. Here's a recap:

 

1\. He removed the Most Important Relationship question from LBW, which would have been a strange entry had it been allowed.

2\. He made going to Stanford Humanities impossible, so I would apply to UPenn

3\. He attracted me to M&T, yet in the end I never got to go there.

 

Something about all of this is pushing me in a very specific direction. We will see how this all turns out. In the meantime, however, it is great to have seen all of these developments all in just the 2019 school year. This year is one of greatness, with many different objectives to follow. Primarily, my goal from the past years was to simply build a resume. For the upcoming year, it will be one of simply pursuing greatness: to find new opportunities, pursue them, immerse myself, and become a more complete holistic package.
