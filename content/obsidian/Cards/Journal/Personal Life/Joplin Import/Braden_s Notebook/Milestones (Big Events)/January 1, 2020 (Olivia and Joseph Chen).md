# January 1, 2020 (Olivia and Joseph Chen)
January 1, 2020 (Olivia and Joseph Chen)

AM

I am grateful for the develoments that God has allowed me on this day, for today has been the greatest day of my life to kick off the 2020 year. I have met Joseph Chen, one of the greatest most developed juniors I have ever known.

 

He is my age. His girlfriend is at Berkeley MET. His market is in sustainability and business. He wants to go to M&T. He has Yale Global Scholars, CTY, and is applying to LBW, MTSI, and more. His resume is absolutely stacked with businesses and interships, cold emailing his way to new opportunities. He has more APs than me, and at Exidor high school, has more leadership in clubs. He eclipses me in every way, yet we can talk about economics all day, covering the same topics but taking different angles (competition vs. high level math, physics vs. bio and STEM, etc.). Joseph Chen and Braden Wong is a collaboration I very much see happening in the future.

 

Among this, it is strange to have seen many different ways Olivia and I have met.

 

1\. She was going to be my SMW Dance Partner

2\. I was going to ask her to Homecoming

3\. We played Quiz Bowl together at the SMW Gathering

4\. We met in the Starbucks and she introduced me to Joseph

5\. We can talk about philosophy for many hours

 

However humble she is, it is apparent that she is an ideal candidate and awesome person to just hang out with. :))
