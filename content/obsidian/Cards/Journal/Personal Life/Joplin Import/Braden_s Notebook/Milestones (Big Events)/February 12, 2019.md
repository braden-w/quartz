Another Tuesday, more troubles.

 

Today was a big day. Japanese students came in, and they were absolutely fantastic. My man Ricki was especially interesting.

I still can't help but feel puzzled by Michelle's behavior in the past few days. She ritually avoids me, yet today seemed to have made indirect eye contact, and touched my shoulder twice when the exchange students departed. Yet, maybe she does that with everyone. I am far from the person to judge.

 

Anyway, tomorrow is going to be an even bigger day. It is the day of the AMC 12B. The AMC 12A was a spectacular overcommit from my end because I had worried too much. Well, today I will rest assured knowing that there is nothing to worry about. If it is meant to be, it will be. Winning is a result, not an outcome. Learning is a process, not a result. I am trying my best to keep up with everything, but know that if I don't get anything tomorrow, I'll still be happy. There is no such thing as losing in this case. I am only seeing if I can gain a little more. God knows what is best for me in this situation. I have learned my lesson, and it is time to see what I can do. Let's hope to see some strength and power in tomorrow's lesson. I pray that the right thoughts and the right mindset be instilled within me conducive to success.
