I thrive off tension.

 

I've been working up the courage to as Michelle out for a while now. It's slow. It's painful. It's uncertain. She knows how to sew doubt into anybody's mind. However, if anybody is going to ask her, why wouldn't it be me? Is anyone more capable or fit to go with her than me? I have so many talents, so many special gifts, that I can't imagine what would happen if we didn't go.

 

What happens if I ask? I might get accepted. I might get rejected. But both outcomes are something I'm comfortable with. Look at me. If I ask anybody else, would they not say yes? She is at the upper echelon, and if I can't get there yet then I'll just go one step lower. She has standards, and she doesn't want anybody who she hangs out with. This is the chance to be different.

 

But what happens if I don't ask? Doesn't matter, it's worse than being accepted or rejected. For certain, she will be wild, and maybe I will be, but we belong on the same dance floor. Nothing more, nothing less.

 

So today, I promise myself I will have the courage to ask. Today is the day I make history and do my best. I will offer the truth, and whatever happens, so be it. There is no shame in being honest. If I get rejected, who cares? I will just be ablip on the radar. If I get accepted, I'll be a legend. Either way, I will emerge happier and stronger from today. God, please be with me on this journey.
