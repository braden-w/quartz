Yesterday, as we packed Holiday grams, I watched Elisha get accepted to Cornell. She flipped out and was super excited. Meanwhile, my friend Shawn got accepted into Harvard. Incredibly happy for both of them! The energy in the room was amazing and I look forward to hearing news from David Zhu and Stephen. My boy Ruobin is EDing Wharton with me and so there is a chance we both might go, as well as Nicole. However, of course, it is not one of certainty. The worst case scenario is one in which neither makes it except me, in which I must adapt and make new friends in high school.

 

It is only 4 days until I receive word from Wharton and SEAS whether or not my application may make M&T 2024. I am incredibly excited, not just for what may be in that letter, but what implications it may carry for the rest of the year. Should I be accepted, the rest of my school year shall be incredibly lax and ambitious, to take on new challenges and push my own boundaries. However, should I be rejected, I will have great difficulty explaining to my parents the situation LOL. Just kidding, but I willl need to invest significantly more work should that be the case to recover during the second semester.

 

I just listened to a podcast from Adam Grant and Tim Ferris and was intrigued by its advice. Writing in the morning sounds like solid advice, especially for a guy like me, who is about to embark on some of the greatest writing endeavors of his life. I will keep that in mind moving forward and do my best to consistently sleep early to rise early as well.

 

Reestablishing my morning ritual through early wakeups is profoundly appreciated. Today's assembly has a lot of work to be done but it is only things that I look forward to.
