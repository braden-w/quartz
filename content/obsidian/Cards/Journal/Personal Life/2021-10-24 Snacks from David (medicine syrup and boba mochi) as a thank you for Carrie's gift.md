# [[2021-10-24]] Snacks From David (medicine Syrup and Boba mochi) as a Thank You for Carrie's Gift
Told David Carrie and I missed him and Jen told us that she normally has something she dislikes about everyone but can find nothing to dislike about David, he is just super likeable

I'm so grateful that my suitemates are so awesome, and that David is my suitemate
