# Guide to Coding Interviews

## Guide to Referrals
Here was my process:
- Get a giant Notion Table like [this](https://www.notion.so/Job-Applications-87f06f9033b54c13939b2af5f862c0e2)
- Add all the companies that I wanted to apply for
- Now, clear the list. For each company:
	- Search online to verify position name
	- Go to LinkedIn for that company, and find someone that works there from my school or connections
	- Use my [[Referral Request Template]] and fill in the details

In particular, I was super drawn to this part:
> How to find your bottle necks: Apply, and see where you reach. Do they reject your CV? Do you fail leetcode questions? Is it the HR interview? Is it telling about your project? It’s hard to guess in advance, and people often spend time on the wrong thing
