# [[2022-05-01]] Letter to Joie on Yale Vs. Princeton for CS
Hi Joie,

Finished most of my finals yesterday and now ready to respond! First off, if you want, would you like to call? Feel free to call me anytime today or tomorrow at 6266274599! Or if you prefer to schedule a meeting, I have a [Calendly](https://calendly.com/braden-w) and we can arrange a time to meet!

Here's what I would boil the decision down to: are you thinking about studying any other areas outside of Computer Science? Do you have any inclinations towards the arts or humanities in addition to Computer Science? If so, Yale is probably a better choice in my opinion. The requirements for a Computer Science major BS are lower, and you only need to take 12 courses (13 if you include prerequisites) out of 36 courses. I'm personally attempting to major in Ethics, Politics, & Economics and Computer Science & Psychology, and low major requirements has definitely aided this. I have an inside joke with my friends that Computer Science is a humanity major—but this is bc it has one of the lowest numbers of course requirements of any STEM major, and this makes double majoring or exploration much easier. Compare this with Chemical engineering, which requires over 22 courses because of prerequisites. CS Department also has several joint majors offered with Math, Psychology, and Economics—this means you do not need to "double major" and take ~24 courses to major in CS and one of these categories. Instead, you can take one 15-course joint major (like CS & Math) to effectively double major and save 9-course slots (which you can reserve for discussion).

If you're interested in hardcore CS, I would recommend Princeton. Their department is probably significantly better than ours in terms of coursework. Their major is also much more rigorous with more requirements (which could be a good or bad thing). But regarding softer aspects beyond coursework—not sure what Princeton's culture is like, but Yale CS is incredibly collaborative (helping each other in psets) and diverse (there's about equal gender distribution and many clubs for Women in STEM). Grading is probably way more forgiving here, but I wouldn't include that in your decision.

My experience studying CS at Yale has been great so far, but this is especially because I get to take classes outside of CS. If you think you might have any interest in a subject outside of CS, I would lean Yale. I’ve found the people in the department to be very supportive.

Overall, my guiding question is what college do you feel personally drawn with or can see yourself attending in the future? Choose the college that you personally associate yourself more with.

Happy to talk about this more! Would love to call sometime to catch up on what’s been going on in your life and ways to assist.

Best,
Braden
