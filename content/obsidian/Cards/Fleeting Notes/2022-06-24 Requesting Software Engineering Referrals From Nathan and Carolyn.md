# [[2022-06-24]] Requesting Software Engineering Referrals From Nathan and Carolyn

## Requesting Referral From Nathan Ahn (Meta)
Hey Nathan, I hope all is going well with you this summer—is now a bad time to ask for a huge favor? I was wondering if you would be opposed to writing a referral for me at Meta—I hope that the time we spent working in YHack, tackling problem sets, and chatting together could provide some insight. If you are, that's totally ok and I understand! I'm just trying to navigate the recruitment process in any way I can. If there's ever a way I can help you out or if you're ever down to practice Leetcode together, I'm down!

## Requesting Referral From Carolyn Qu (Google)
Hey Carolyn, I hope all is going well with you this summer—is now a bad time to ask for a huge favor? I was wondering if you would be opposed to drafting a referral for me at Google—I hope that the time we spent working in YHack, debugging projects, and chatting about web development could provide some insight. If you are, that's totally ok and I understand! I'm just trying to navigate the recruitment process in any way I can. If there's ever a way I can help you out or if you're ever down to practice Leetcode together, I'm down!
