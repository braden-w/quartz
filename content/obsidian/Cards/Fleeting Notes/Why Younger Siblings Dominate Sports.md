# Why Younger Siblings Dominate Sports
Competing with older siblings, who often overpower them physically, challenges younger siblings to think critically and creatively to find ways to win.
> As well as honing psychological skills, playing with an older sibling can also accelerate the development of physical skills. The theory is that athletes learn more when they are challenged and fail; the difficulties of these situations can provide feedback that [enables athletes to adapt and develop their skills](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15130871/). While older siblings can generally rely on being bigger and stronger to win, younger siblings “playing up” to their older siblings’ level need to develop creativity, decision-making skills and tactical intelligence to keep up — ultimately benefiting them on the field even when they are no longer at a physical disadvantage. Whether consciously or not, older siblings can pass on instructions to their younger siblings. “The ideal strategy for a younger sibling is to try out the same sport in which an older sibling is already established, benefit from a possible teaching effect, and then see if one can do better than the older sibling in that same sport,” Sulloway said.

> The amount of informal play that athletes do may also be a predictor of who goes on to become elite. A study comparing soccer players who were offered scholarships from Premier League academies at age 16 with players who were released found that the two groups had accumulated a nearly identical number of hours in practice at their academies.⁠ But players offered scholarships had spent more than twice as much time per year on informal soccer play — games with family and friends in local streets and parks — than the players who were released. [The NBA has also noted](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326088011_The_NBA_and_Youth_Basketball_Recommendations_for_Promoting_a_Healthy_and_Positive_Experience) that informal play exposes children to more variables — like different roles and positions, court sizes and numbers of players — which can accelerate skill development, creating “smarter learners” used to adapting.

> These findings further help explain the little-sibling effect. Younger siblings are generally able to get more informal play at a younger age than those without older siblings, as they can play with their elder brothers and sisters. Firstborns and only children have to wait for their parents to play with them, or for their parents to arrange play dates; those with elder siblings do not.

> Parents also give younger siblings a better chance of becoming elite athletes by treating them differently. Parents are notoriously more indulgent of later-born children, letting them go out more at a younger age — including engaging in unsupervised informal play. Compared with older siblings, younger siblings are around 40 percent more likely to be allowed to play dangerous contact sports, so they have more opportunity of making it to the top in these sports. A certain rebellious streak may also benefit younger siblings on the field: In Major League Baseball, younger brothers are 10.6 times more likely to attempt to steal a base and 3.2 times more likely to steal successfully, Sulloway and Zweigenhaft found. Later-born MLB players are also more likely to get hit by a pitch than than their older brothers, suggesting that they’re less likely to be intimidated and less willing to back down from a confrontation — perhaps because those younger brothers were hit by more pitches growing up playing with their elder brothers.

> By the time younger siblings follow older siblings into the talent pathway for a particular sport, parents are “more familiar with how to navigate the sporting system,” said Melissa Hopwood, the co-author of the study of Canadian and Australian athletes. “They knew the good clubs, the good coaches, the commitment required, so they had a more informed, deliberate experience rather than flying blind.”

> Athletes can also learn from what worked — and what didn’t — for their older siblings. This has been the case with the remarkable [Ingebrigtsen family](https://www.european-athletics.org/competitions/european-athletics-championships/news/article=filip-and-henrik-ingebrigtsen-bask-jakob-1500m-success-berlin/index.html) of runners. Three of the Norwegian brothers have won the gold medal in the 1,500-meter race at the European Championships. Jakob Ingebrigtsen, the youngest of the brothers, is the only one who has also won the gold medal in the European Championships’ 5,000-meters event; in 2018, at age 17, he won gold in both the 1,500and 5,000-meter races.
