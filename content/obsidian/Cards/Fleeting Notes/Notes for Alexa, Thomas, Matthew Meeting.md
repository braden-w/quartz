# Notes for Alexa, Thomas, Matthew Meeting
- You're going to think I'm tooting my own horn, that I'm talking about things that don't matter
	- I have strong doubts on whether you will be able to recreate the EC Bazaar
	- I do think that there are soft things about culture that I provided
- What do you think I'm effective for?
	- I think failure to recognize what I am effective for is a good indicator
	- I do not feel mentorship from anyone here, the closest was from Eui Young
