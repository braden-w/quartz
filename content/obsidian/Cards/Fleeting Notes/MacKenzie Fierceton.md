# MacKenzie Fierceton
It seems like a [[Character Assassination]] since she was going to testify against [[University of Philadelphia|UPenn]] in court regarding a different incident.

Much of what the media and university said about her “fake” upbringing was actually true, and the amount of information flying around may have been used to protect [[University of Philadelphia|UPenn]]'s' reputation from her possible testimony on the other subject.
