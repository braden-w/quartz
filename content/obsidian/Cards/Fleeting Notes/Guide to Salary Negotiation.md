# Guide to Salary Negotiation
From the Kalzumeus Software article:
- Your model is broken
- **Virtually any amount of money available to you personally is mouse droppings to your prospective employer**.
	- [[To the World You May Be One Person; but to One Person You May Be the World]]
	- They will not feel offended if you ask for it.  (I received a comment that this is untrue for startups by someone today.
- [[Only Negotiate Salary After You Will Guarantee to Be Hired After Agreement]]
- [[Start Negotiating When You Reach Yes-If, Not No-But]]

## Don't give them a number
>**Objection**: “I really need a number to move the process forward.”
>
> **What you should think**: “You’re lying to me to attempt to get me to compromise my negotiating position.”
>
> **What you should say**: “I’m more concerned at the moment with talking to you about discovering whether we’re a mutual fit.  If we’re a great fit, then I can be flexible on the numbers with you and you can be flexible on the numbers with me.  If we’re not a great fit, then the numbers are ultimately irrelevant, because your company only hires A players and I only work at roles I would be an A player at.”

> **Objection**: “This form needs a number.”
>
> **What you should think**: “You’re lying to me to attempt to get me to compromise my negotiating position.”
>
> **What you should say**: “Give me git access and I’ll fix it in a jiffy!  _both people laugh_ No, seriously, speaking, I’m more concerned at the moment with discovering whether we’re a mutual fit…  Oh, it’s physically impossible?  Put in $1 then to get the ball rolling, and we’ll circle back to this later.”
>
> **Objection**: “We want to figure out whether you’re an appropriate candidate for the position.”
>
> **What you should think**: “You’re lying to me to attempt to get me to compromise my negotiating position.”
>
> **What you should say**: “It’s so important to me that this is a good mutual fit for us.  Let’s talk about why I’m a great fit for this position: I know you’re concerned about $FILL_IN_THE_BLANK.  In addition to my previous successes doing it, I have some great ideas for what I’d do about that if I was working at your company.  Would you like to drill into those or is there another job area you’re more concerned about to start with?”
>
> **Objection**: “I’m sorry, great try at a dodge there, but I just can’t go forward without a number.”
>
> **What you should think**: “You’re lying to me to attempt to get me to compromise my negotiating position.”
>
> **What you should say (if you’re an engineer): “**Well, you know, I would hate to have to walk away from the negotiation over this.  Working with your company looked it would have been such a wonderful opportunity.  I hear the hiring market is super-tight right now, would you like me to introduce you to other candidates?  Maybe we can shave a couple of months off of you filling this position.”
>
> **What you should say (if you’re not an engineer)**: “Damn, I guess I should have studied engineering.”
>
> **What you should say (if you’re a little put out by that comment)**: “Well, you know, salary is only one component of the total compensation package.  In terms of total compensation, we’re probably looking at something like $FILL_IN_NUMBER_HERE.”  (Suggested calculation: take the package value from your last company and add 5~10%.  If you don’t know how to calculate the value of your compensation package, _learn that_, but as a rough guesstimate salary + 30 ~ 50% for full-time employees in professional roles and the multiplier tends to scale up as your base salary scales up.)
