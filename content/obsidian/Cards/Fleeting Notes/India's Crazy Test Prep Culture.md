# India's Crazy Test Prep Culture
- Brutal test prep, IIT, All of India Rank (AIR), the superstars like AIR.
- There are posters of people with them lucky to even crack 4 people into IIT.
- There's a city with almost 100,000 students dedicated to preparing for the entrance exams for certain studies
- So not studying, but studying to get to study
