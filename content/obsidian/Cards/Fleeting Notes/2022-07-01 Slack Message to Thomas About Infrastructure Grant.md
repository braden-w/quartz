# [[2022-07-01]] Slack Message to Thomas About Infrastructure Grant
Hey Thomas, following up from our discussion earlier: I was wondering if I could run this grant application by you or grant makers for feedback?[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1coDhSTd76rSFWITIYlbKQGNgYXW9HAaiWPR7OJ7iPA4/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1coDhSTd76rSFWITIYlbKQGNgYXW9HAaiWPR7OJ7iPA4/edit#)Had a few questions as this is my first time applying:

1. I’ve been discussing getting funding for Ben and Yara for their work. Should this be included in the application or a separate application?
2. On a similar note, we may want to get funding for  X-risk club community building, and initial seed funding for events. Should this be included in the application or a separate application (if separate, I still think it can be grouped with 2.)? It would be ideal if we could group all of these funding requests together
3. In general, is there anything else that my application may be missing? I’m thinking about the sections regarding project description, goals, track record, and the amount requested
