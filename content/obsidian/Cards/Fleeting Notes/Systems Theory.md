# Systems Theory
Look at [[Emergent Properties]] because [[The Whole is Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts]]
![](https://i.imgur.com/ZZGrGPm.png)

Developed for systems that are:
- Too complex for complete analysis
	- Separation into (interacting) subsystems distorts the results
	- The most important properties are emergent
- Too organized for statistics
	- Too much underlying structure that distorts the statistics
	- New technology and designs have no historical information
