# There is No Evolutionary Purpose for Grieving
Evolutionarily speaking, grieving is just a side effect of the very deep relationships we form with other humans. Otherwise, there are a lot of downsides. For example, [[Becoming a Widow Places You at Increased Risk to Die Within the Next 6 Months]].

In [[Gen Z]] terms, people who say grieving gives [[Love]] meaning may just be having [[Copium]] and have a [[Motivated reasoning]].

Using the above, while you should have a positive attitude to grieving, don't embellish it.
