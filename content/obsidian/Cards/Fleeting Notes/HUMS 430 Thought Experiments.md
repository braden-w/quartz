# HUMS 430 Thought Experiments

## What Are [[Thought Experiments?]]

## Lecture 1
- Thinking [[Counterfactual Reasoning||counterfactually]] about what-ifs
- Thinking suppositionaly
- Thought experiments are also called [[Intuition Pumps]] (Daniel Bennet)
	- Thought experiments are a way of us arriving at different conclusions we wouldn't have gotten to had we not entertained the initial premise
- [[Plato's Ring of Gyges]] Thought Experiment
	- Conclusion: You are a person
- 1936—The most disruptive thought experiment is born
	- [[Turing Machines]]
	- Because of this, binary computation was implemented by von Newman
	- The world is run on turing machines
	- It is one of the most disruptive thought experiment
- What is suppositional belief? #On/Philosophy #Type/Concept
	- Are you not engaging in suppositional belief every time you are engaging in a novel?
- World-building in thought experimients
	- The world in Frankenstein is extremely developed
	- The Trolley Problem, in contrast, is minimum
		- Questions irrelevant in the experiment are left out
			- Is the paint chipping off the track?
			- H. G. Wells: Imagine you could travel in time the same way you leap through space
			- Shelley: What if we could create a new body?
				- What does this raise thoughts on [[Dualism]], [[Mind Body Problem]], [[Philosophy]]?
- Thinking of the [[Flynn Effect]] and the rise of suppositional belief having led to increases in intelligence
	- How is abstract thinking different from suppositional thinking? #Type/Source/Question #Personal
	- Suppose there were more people thinking suppositionally? #Type/Source/Question #Personal
- There should not be that much of an overlap of STEM and Humanities #Type/Hot_Take/Derived
	- Professor: We should not pay attention
	- Sherlock Holmes is Deduction, not Induction #Type/Hot_Take/Derived

## Lecture [[2022-09-13]]

### Responses on Recreating
How does Frankenstein raise on identity and qualia? Include specific examples from the story Frankenstein.
- In the story Frankenstein, the creature is created without a name and without any sense of identity. He is constantly referred to as "the creature," "the monster," or "it." The creature is never given the chance to create his own identity; instead, he is defined by what others think of him. This lack of identity creates a deep sense of loneliness and isolation for the creature. He is constantly searching for a sense of connection and belonging, but is never able to find it. The creature's experience of qualia is also deeply affected by his lack of identity. Qualia are the subjective experiences of sensory stimuli, such as the taste of a strawberry or the sound of a bird singing. Because the creature is never given a name or an identity, he is never able to associate himself with any of the qualia he experiences. He is always an outsider, looking in on the world but never truly part of it. This creates a deep sense of alienation and isolation for the creature.

### Questions
A couple things in Frankenstein to think about:
1. Victor describes what he is doing as "bestowing animation upon lifeless matter" (53). What makes this phrase and idea so strange and uncanny? What are we being asked to imagine here ? What intuitions are pumped about “life” when we consider the animate and inanimate in this way? ^Bestow
2. That phrase comes at the end of what I call the HAND WAVING paragraph ie. a rather momentous experimental result issuing from a rather scanty descriptive explanation (ie, hand waving at some phrases about "discovering the cause and generation of life"). How does the suspension of disbelief work here? How are the "science" and the "fiction" fused in Shelley's prose? ^HandWaving
3. Does the monster have a sense of self? Where did it's personhood come from? Where does its agency come from? Its motivation? Its desires? ^SenseOfSelf

### Bestowing animation to lifeless matter
- In response to [[#^Bestow]]

### Context
- Shelley received a "masculine education"
- Galvinism and electricity
- Galvini is doing experiments with frogs and electricity
- So many things
	- Artic exploration
	- Science
	- [[Epistolary]]
- Obsession of birthing
	- Her mother died in childbirth and had miscarriage
	- Shelley was likely traumatized by birth, but also fascinated by it as a [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical]] and scientific perspective
- [[Ancillary]] and [[Term Police]]

### More questions
- [[Mind Body Problem]] and [[Dualism]]?
- How does alienation and lack of sympathy affects someone?

### On description
- The Being
- I did it, I did it, I did it, until he paid the maximum prize
	- Parable: Nuclear bomb, and the cost of scientific curiosity/discovery/pride
- [[Frankenstein as caution for scientific curiosity]]
- Frankenstein as a meditation on childhood
	- A child in an adult frame
	- "I ought to be Adam"
	- [[Paradise Lost]]
- The monster is comically eloquent
	- Similar to the quality of the speech of Satan from [[Paradise Lost]]

### Handwaving
In response to [[#^HandWaving]].
- Technical description is really sparse
- I did everything methodically, worked really hard, etc.
- Hand waving and [[Suspension of belief]]

### Inability to introspect
- Victor's loneliness leads him to not have the capacity to talk with others, which deprives him of the ability to introspect
- It's interesting that the monster's idea is to kill everyone that Frankenstein cares about, to make him as lonely as the monster

### Quoting your own soul
- Quotes his own soul (maybe Victor is a bit odd)
- Personalized the soul of Viktor such that he can quote from it
- Intospective in solitude and "quotes" is soul
- [["A thought doesn't come when you want it to come. It comes when you want it to come."]]
	- It's difficult to cause preference change
		- Pointing a gun to coerce someone to believe
	- Connection to [[Buddhism]]
 - Neuroplasticity and the massive reroutability of dendrites
 - If you are truly [[Materialism|Materialist]], you must at some point be a [[Determinism]]
	 - [[Solving AI Safety by simulating the world]]
[https://philarchive.org/archive/ECATFP](https://philarchive.org/archive/ECATFP)

### The [[Preference Update]] once he sees his monster
- His disgust may be because he cannot watch to see something else have personhood
- His vanity is wounded by the autonomy of the being he created

### Victor lacks responsibility
He refers to it as an "unhallowing" as if there is moral high ground and elevated diction. In reality, he is probably just disgusted or cannot care to see it have personhood

### On loneliness
- Personhood depends on social transactions, almost as if acknowledgement like [[Hegel]] would say in the [[Master slave dialectic]] from [[Dialectics]]
	- But the novel is not necessarily implying that personhood is what results from the experiment
		- Instead, it is something that has interiority, wonders about consequences, demands attention and acknolwedgement

## Lecture [[2022-09-15]]
- More questions raised by [[Frankenstein]]
	- What is [[personhood]]?
	- [[State of nature]]
	- How is one socialized and learns social norms?
	- This again reminds me of [[PSYC 140 Developmental Psychology]] and [[Developmental Psychology]]

- [[Determinism]], often contrasted with [[Free will]], and [[Compatabilism]]
- [[Rational choice theory]]
- [[Laplace's demon]]
- Roger Penrose Stuart Hameroff—Consciousness arises from biology thinking that it is conscious
- Free will
- Conscious awareness is what collapses the wave function. There is a deep link with consciousness and quantum
- [[The Emperor's New Mind]] and one of the most comprehensive cases against [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]]
- [["A thought doesn't come when you want it to come. It comes when you want it to come."]]
- [[Frankenstein]] just wanted to live in a [[State of nature]]
	- I just wanted a person who can look at me without revulsion
- Frankenstein populating with a female is overhyped
	- You could just stop procreation and design it without organs
	- It is probably a moral outburst
- Choice is free if we redefine free
	- Our lives are motivated by a series of chance events
	- We are unfree in the sense of the ability to choose otherwise
	- But we are free in the sense that we are not coerced
		- A good response to [[Gun to head]]
- [[Determinism as copium]]
	- [[Free Will|Internal Locus of Control]]
- Pushback at saying that lightning striking the tree was the cause of the creation
	- [[Motivated reasoning]] and [[Unreliable]]
	- "He has a self-assigned [[Teleology|Telos]]"

### "Be Right Back"
- I contend that I would really like Ash given the right perspective, give him a lot of leeway, and he responds incredibly well to reinforcement
	- Example of a helpless robot learning through [[Reinforcement learning]]
- She's dissatisfied by him not being close enough to the original Ash
	- Maybe he's in the [[uncanny valley]]
	- But I think this is really just an emotional response, in addition to as Teddy and we have said, it's a rejection of us just being data streams and information processing
	- If he started from scratch, would he be better?
		- Or if he was explicitly not to be a replica, but an idealized version, would this make it better?
- [[There is No Evolutionary Purpose for Grieving]]
	- This is a [[Motivated reasoning]]
	- What if we could ask her to have her grief completely disappear? Is this outburst emotional?
- But she's also very satisfied in other ways
	- You look really good
		- Curated and based off what Ash posted (people post the best part of everything)
	- Sex is juxtaposed
	- But new Ash never refers to his phone
	- Replacability of people?
	- Replacability of yourself? What if you could shape your own preferences and beliefs in an idealized version of yourself.
- I find most of Ash's behavior very understandable
- The only thing that stops us is [[Epistemology]]
	- The knowledge that you know it is not real
- Note Ash's addiction to his phone
	- Even from the van scene, where he rudely ignores his girlfriend with two lattes in the rain due to him being glued to his phone
	- Irony that what he puts in his phone is what will reconstruct him
		- But until then, it's a huge pain point
	- [[Black Mirror refers to the black reflective screen of your phone]]
	- But new Ash never refers to his phone
- In contrast to [[Frankenstein]], the robot has no needs or desires
- Nice transition from phone to voice to actual person
	- She even freaks out after dropping the phone, as if Ash is dead
- What is more [[uncanny valley|uncanny]] than a robot having no needs or desires
- There is no [["A thought doesn't come when you want it to come. It comes when you want it to come."|spontaneous thought]]. Every desire must be scripted and elicited

## Section [[2022-09-20]]

### [[Ship of Theseus]]
- The three [[Thought Experiment]]s for [[Ship of Theseus]]
	1. Replaced all the planks
	2. Replaced all the planks, and put the old ones in a bin, then rebuild in the spring
	3. Replaced all the planks, and use the old ones to make another ship
- Personal identity
	- There is continuity over time and preservation
- Cellular replacement, we are not the same people on a cellular level

### What does [[Thought Experiment]] do differently that a regular argument does not?
- Greater economy of expression—but then why not just reduce it further into an argument?
	- Why not just using an argument or symbolic notation?
	- There is a [[The Whole is Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts|sum greater than the parts]] property of thought experiments where you are invited into metaphor and scene setting

### Artifact identity and personal identity
- [[Ship of Theseus]] asks for artifact identity
- [[Teleportation (Thought Experiment)]] asks for personal identity
- [[Frankenstein]] asks for both artifact and personal identity
- [[Teleportation (Thought Experiment)]]
	- An interesting

### Main line and branch line
- In branch lines, there is a quantitative change. There are literally two
- Painting a billiard ball
	- Changes the qualitative identity (it's green instead of red) but not quantitative identity (it's still 7)
- The fission problem, of splitting one ship into two ([[Ship of Theseus]])
- What if a universe had two objects are the same?
	- Chances are, in this universe, there are two objects that are completely identical to each other in structure.
- Categorization has likeness but not the same
	- We say they are all ships
- Mentioning that we are all receiving continuity from the top
- Agastya's position
	- It's going to be empircally the same regardless
	- But by the way, our analysis introduces identity
- [[Sorites paradox]]
- My take
	- There is a terrible chaos to all of this
		- Intelligence is information processing, and we are attempting to process the chaos of the world
	- It seems like we prefer simplicity in our definitions of identity
		- But I would argue that there is just infinite complexity and these are approximations, shots in the dark, where we attempt to label some sort of patterns or arbitrary groupings in data
		- So these are subjective "shots in the dark" on top of some objective pattern in data (In response to identity is a construct)
	- What if ship of Theseus had every plank replaced except one?
		- There's a paper called [[The Bitter Lesson]]
	- Mathematical objects are different from objects of sentimental value
		- How exactly? Rather than there is just more information
- Russell's clusters of descriptions
- [[Pay attention to the shape of the answer we're looking for]]
- (in the philosophy of Leibniz) an indivisible and hence ultimately simple entity, such as an atom or a person.

## Lecture [[2022-09-22]]
- Details in thought experiment
	- Provide verisimilitude
		- the appearance of being true or real: the detail gives the novel some verisimilitude.
- The idea that your replica has all your memories and bears evidence of its own novel experiences, and it's your wife
- Branching problem
	- There's one wife, but there's two husbands
- I'm about to die, and hear the words of consolation from my replica that I
	- He will love my wife, take care of my kids, and yet my consciousness will end
- One have to be a [[Determinism]] if you believe that a replica would make the exact same choices if it were in the same location
	- Why not be [[Compatabilism|Compatabilist]] along the way and say you also have free will
- Caesar crossing the Rubicon
	- Leibniz said it was in his notion to do so, even though he perceives it as free will
	- There is a level of [[Telos]],
- Replication as a way for [[Immortality]]
	- [[I don't want to achieve immortality through my work; I want to achieve immortality through not dying. I don't want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen; I want to live on in my apartment.]]

In Reasons and Persons, Parfit argues that there is a fundamental distinction between what matters to us and what we have reason to want. What matters to us are our own desires and preferences, while what we have reason to want are those things that are good for us. This distinction is important because it helps to explain why we often make choices that are not in our best interests. We may want things that are bad for us because we do not fully understand what is good for us, or because we have conflicting desires.
In Reasons and Persons, Parfit argues that there are three fundamental principles that we should use when making moral decisions: the principle of humanity, the principle of future generations, and the principle of impartiality.
In Reasons and Persons, Parfit argues that what matters is not what we are, but what we are like. He claims that there is no single correct answer to the question of what we should do. Instead, we should try to do what would make the world as good as possible.
- Cofee cup
	- Viscosity alone, coffee alone, liquidity alone, mug alone, scente alone, is not enough to synthesize a coffee cup
- Our personhood -> judgement -> intention as a flow of being from a person
