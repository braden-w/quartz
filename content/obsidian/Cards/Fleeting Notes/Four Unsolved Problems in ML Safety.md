# Four Unsolved Problems in ML Safety

## [[Robustness]]
Create models that are resilient to adversaries, unusual situations, and Black Swan events.

## [[Monitoring]]
Detect malicious use, monitor predictions, and discover unexpected model functionality.

### Anomaly Detection

### Trojans

## [[Alignment]]
Build models that represent and safely optimize hard-to-specify human values.

### Value Learning

### Proxy Gaming

## [[Systemic Safety]]
Use ML to address broader risks to how ML systems are handled, such as cyberattack

### ML for Cybersafety

### ML for Improved Epistemics
