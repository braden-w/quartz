# PSYC 140 Developmental Psychology
- There was one thing we had in common—We were all babies
- Why are we all different? Where does [[Knowledge]] come from?

## Lecture [[2022-09-06]]

### Bias that things are learned rather than innate
| Ability                              | When Acquired (Year) |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Seeing                               | 0-0.5                |
| Hearing                              | 0-0.5                |
| Discriminating Colors                | 0-0.5                |
| Discriminating Distances             | 0-0.5                |
| Prefer Faces to Non Faces            | 0-0.5                |
| Think unsupported objects will fall  | 0-0.5                |
| Think hidden objects are still there | 0-0.5                |
| Discriminate quantities              | 0-0.5                |
| Prefer helping others                | 0-0.5                |
| Learn to read                        | 2-4                  |

- We have a bias that most things are learned, rather than innate
	- We guessed the above in class, and overshot every metric except "learn to read". People have these skills much earlier than we thought
	- "Most of what we know has been taught to us"
		- "Let us then suppose the mind to be… void of all characters, without any ideas…"—John Locke on the [[Blank Slate]]
		- "The ego has to be developed"—Sigmund Freud on Narcissm
	- Maybe this is an innate bias that things are learned from an evolotionary perspective
		- It is [[Evolution|Evolutionarily Advantageous]] for people to believe that things are learned, sincec
- **[[Even Though We Were All Children, We Have a Lot of Biases That Prevent Us From Understanding What Children Actually Know]]**
- We think what we know derives from experience
- Studying development of processes allow us to answer questions
	- [[Zebras Are Black with White Stripes]]
		- We thought they were white with black stripes
		- Studying baby zebras, however, shows that they are black with white striipes
- It also allows us to find out what can go ary
	- Zebra with white dots rather than stripes is beautiful, but not
- Big questions for cognitive development
	- The causes and consequences of psychopathology
	- How can we create social policies that help children thrive?
		- [[COVID-19]] impacts on Child Development?
			- 9 Year Olds are way behind on reading and math, according to a recent New York Times post

- Seeing [[Adversarial Examples]]
	- Dan Hendrycks was featured!!
	- [[2022-09-01 Email to Julia Leonard About Dan Hendrycks]]

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02498.pdf#:~:text=The%20performance%20of%20these%20deep,5%20error%20rate%20of%203.57%25.

What do you want to get out
Understanding a lot more about biases about child development and innateness!
- What do you want to be when you grow up? : Happy
	- Parents increasingly want their kids to be "Happy"

- Don't take easy courses just for your GPA
	- Dr. Julia Leonard was focused on getting good grades, but didn't learn as much

### Is development stage-like or continuous?
- Stage-like (qualitative change) versus continuous (quantitative)
- Is development global or local?
	- Kids who walked interacted way more than kids who didn't #Type/Experimental_Study
- How to see if moral reasoning and mathematic abilities were related?
	1. Follow kids over time (longitudinal study)
	2. Intervention study
		- We could make a training study where we measure moral reasoning ability before and after training them in mathematics.

- [[Rationalism]] versus [[Empiricism]]
	- Knowledge of that which is true is innate ([[Plato]])
	- Knowledge based on experiments ([[Aristotle]])
- The fall of [[Behaviorism]]
	- Tolman showed that rats learned information that wasn't explicitly reinforced
	- Bandura showed you can learn through watching wouth explicit reinforcements
	- Chomsky showed language could not be learned by "mere association" (povety of thes timulus)
	- PIaget argued learning depended on structure of environment
- The rise of new approaches to [[Developmental Psychology]]
	1. [[Cognitive science]]
	2. Comparative and [[Evolutionary Psychology]]
	3. Cross-cultural
		- Issues with Developmental Psychology
			- Until 2010s, small sample sizes (n = 20) of mostly Western, White children
			- [[Replication crisis]], research was siloed
			- Ground truth? What development is real?
			- [[Many Babies]]
				- Replicate most basic study at scale
				- Replicated a robust finding: [[infants prefer infant-directed speech over adult-directed speech]] AROUND THE WORLD
	4. [[Neuroscience]]
- Piaget
	- Wanted to bridge rationalism and empricism
	- Founded "genetic epistemology"
	- Piaget Mechanisms (Adaptations)
		1. Schemas:: internal knowledge and structures
		2. Assimilation: Incoporate new knowledge into existing structures
		3. Accomodation:: Change cognitive structures to accomodate new evidence
	- Cognitive structures are developed
	- Piaget's stages

| Stage                      | What's Lacking        |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Sensimotor                 | [[Object Permanence]] |
| Preoperational state: 2-7  | [[Conservation]]  and Perspective Taking         |
| Concrete operational: 7-11 |   Hypotheticals and Abstract Thinking                    |
| Formal operational: 11+    |                       |

- Challenges to Piaget (Piaget is wrong)
	- Questioning of experimental methodologies—leading question
		- Which row has more quarters?
	- Comparing children at different ages, not Longitudinal
	- Discovery of many early compentencies
		- Object permance by 3-months (Spelke)
	- A not B
		- Baby could not update schema that lion is hidden in new location (B)
		- Complications
			1. Could be communication or nature of study: Children are more successful if no communication and location is just changed
			2. Possible alternative explanation: A problem with inhibitating actions
				- They know where it is, but cannot control their motor plans
			3. Memory: Babies don't have memory
	- Infants have abstract representations, make inferences, can reason
- Unfortunately, Piaget's theory is still a dominant view of children outside of academia
	- The idea that kids use their existing knowledge for new knowwledge is extremely influential

## Lecture [[2022-09-08]]
- [[Scope Insensitivity]]
- [[Visual cliff]] is wrong

## Lecture [[2022-09-13]]
- [[Preferential sucking]]
	- Have music play, and it plays louder if they suck more
- [[Babies prefer baby talk]]
- [[Theory of Mind]]
- [[Red circle, yellow triangle, blue triangle googly eyes experiment]] #Type/Experimental_Study
	- They all have a preference towrads prosocial individuals
	- Physical choice paradigm

## Lecture [[2022-09-16]]
- Twin study -Suzuki, Ando, & Sato
	- See which hand babies use to reach into tube
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ybMx2WC.jpg)
	- [[Left-handedness]] is genetic
	- Cross-sectional versus Longitudinal
	- Cross-sectional
		- Pros
			- Fast and efficient
		- Cons
			- Selection bias (preschoolers from the Yale daycare)
			- Can't tell discrete vs. continuous change.
			- Challenge of measurement equivalence (how do you test 3, 6, 12, and 18-year-olds on the same concept?)
			- Cohort effects
	- Longitudinal
		- Pros
			- Can use fewer subjects
			- Can provide information
			- about individual
			- differences.
			- Can look at effects of
			- particular interventions.
		- Cons
			- Selective attrition
			- Labor intensive
	- [[Preferential sucking]]

## Lecture [[2022-09-20]]

### Perceptual development
- Giraffes can walk 30 minutes after they're born. Babies, in comparison, cannot walk even after 1 year
- Why grow up fast versus slow?
	- Fast: You're prey, and need to be independent quickly
	- Slow: Longter maturation of brain
- Bigger brains = born early and helpless
	- Helpless babies requires smart big brained adults to care for them
		- Selects for larger brians and intellect, a [[Positive feedback loop]]
	- Usually, the more helpless the baby, the smarter the parents
		- [[Weaning time is a strong predictor of intelligence]]
- Visual acuity
	- Acuity at birth is much worse than adults
	- Babies can see color, but only high contrasts and a subset early on
		- Led to a [[Marketing]] explosion where people were selling high contrast stuff
	- 4-month-olds categorize colors like adults
		- Reminds me of [[Russians are better at identifying blue]]
	- Depth perception
		- [[Stereopsis]]
- Hearing
	- Infants prefer
		- Higher pitched/female voices (might be because it is closer to their range)
	- [[Pruning]]
		- Able to distinguish between ra and la, until later in 8-12 months and it is [[Pruning|pruned]] away
	- Short term exposure to language is enough to help reverse this, but it must be in person
	- Why learning is better in person
		- [[Language is more than just flashcards]]
		- Memory is better in person
		- It's most motivating in person, whne you can interact socially with others
- Taste
	- Babies are acclimated to our parent's diet in the womb
	- [[Taste preferences are formed]]
	- Formula has only one distinc taste, while breast milk has many tastes
		- [[Babies fed formulas may be more picky than those who are breastfed]]
	- [[Babies love sweets]] and Gerber therefore makes even their "vegetable" kits have

## Lecture [[2022-09-22]]

### Reflexes
- Lots of reflexes in infants
- You lose reflexes later to enable more goal-directed behavior

### Walking
- Being bundled up and diapers impedes walking
- Experienced walkers don't fall at higher rates than experienced crawlers (Adolph and colleagues 2012)
- It doesn't matter **when** you learn to walk
- [[Mirror Neurons]]
- [[Classical Conditioning]] and [[Operant Conditioning]]

## Lecture [[2022-09-27]]
- Scottish has 421 words for snow
- [[Piaget]] and [[object permanence]]
	- Babies 4 months old have [[object permanence]]. They were shown a possible event (cardboard hitting barrier) and an impossible event (cardboard clipping through barrier and moving 180 degrees)
		- Then tested again against alternative hypothesis, babies prefer 180 degrees—stopping at 112 degrees
- Kingfishers picking up fish beyond refraction of water
	- Is this innate or are they doing calculations
- Babies do have [[object permanence]]
- Why is continuity but inertia and gravity not?
	- Maybe it's just harder to understand inertia and gravity
- Toy Car going through a wall
	- Babies test hypotheses
	- Surprises are a good way of encoding information better. See [[Salient]]
- Lighting match on wall and using box as a [[Functional Fixedness]] and a design stance. Adults judge objects of the intended function rather than current use

## Lecture [[2022-09-29]]
- Agents versus objects
	- Basic [[Ontology|ontological]] distinction. One of first to appear, last to go
	- [[Agency and moral consideration]]

[[By age five, children think "move" can apply to a passively moved object but reject "move" for a passively moved agent]]
- What distinguishes [[Agent|Agents]] from Objects?
	- (Heider & Simmel 1994)
- Children are asked to evaluate puppets and Puppetgate
	- Framing a puppet as an [[Agent]] or object
- The [[Preferential looking paradigm (PLP)]] and [[Head-turn preference procedure (HPP)]] are **experimental methodologies employed by researchers to measure infants' and toddlers' spontaneous looking and listening behaviours towards visual and auditory stimuli**.
- Do babies understand goal directed actions?
	- How we tested it
		- [[Babies understand goal directed action of lifting pen cap]]
- Agents who don't help at low cost must not be motivated to help ([[Tall person refusing to help versus short person refusing to help]]). In comparison, if there's a high cost (like you're short), it is more forgivable
	- Even 10 month olds can tell this
- [[Attachment Styles]] and internal models
	- 12-16 month old infants
	- Looking time paradigm, followed by "strange situation"
		- Secure were more surprised and looked more in the "insecure" situation
			- Insecure were more surprised and looked
		- Doesn't account for genetics and importantly, culture
			- Predictive if you control for culturemore in the "secure" situation
- Early life deprivation
	- [[Foundling home versus prison nursery]]
		- Very clean versus not clean but social support
		- 37% of Foundling home died
	- [[Romanian Orphanages]]
