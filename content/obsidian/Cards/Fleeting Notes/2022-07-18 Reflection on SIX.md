# [[2022-07-18]] Reflection on SIX
I was blown away by the SIX. SIX is a play that thrives on spectacle, but also accompanies it with substantive performances that convey more messaging than its script would ever imply.

- The feminist message is at times obfuscated. It feels like there are conflicting themes since the implied nature of the play is comparing six women. Although the wives realize in the end that they should not be grouped together or compared, the entire play's premise (including its name) is unfortunately centered around the fact that there were six (wives). Although to be fair, how else would you name this play? "SIX" is, if anything, an [[Objective Not Objectifying]] description of the play, as opposed to "Six Wives," etc.. It is neutral and open to interpretaion, resorting to a numeric digit rather than any other type of label, adjective, or noun
- When I first finished watching, I told Cal that I thought it was well written, and he was surprised, and hen I immediately realized that I meant was regarding composition
- I do think that this is a significant step in the right direction, and would recommend anyone to watch this. I like how they cast women of color, and they were able to not just "incorporate" them, but in my opinion make a work that is far better than the studio recordings of the original cast. Each song has a distinct and raw personality, far more tangible and closer to the contemporary performers they were modeled after. It is a poignant, powerful, and most importantly, good message to convey to general audience

The biggest part of SIX lies in the performers, not the script. I would watch it again.

- This is a feel good play. The ending was to leave
	- Final Spectacle

## What Would You Do Different? What Would a Play Look Like
- Preface: [[I Really Would Like to Critically Examine My Motivations - What I Want, Not What I Want Myself to Want.|I really would like to critically examine my motivations: what I want, not what I want myself to want.]]
- What do I really want from this medium?
	- What role do plays have in affecting change? Wide but shallow, or narrow but deep?
- Simple: release a written, deeper analysis accompanying the play that we would look into
	- After the play, have them be so enamoured that they want to read more. Generate a buzz. I feel like a play's ability to create change is amplified by the number
- The reality is that there are a lot of people who go to the theater to turn off their brains, or enjoy life
	- There is always a tradeoff between superficial entertainment and broad appeal
- If you want to get everyone interested early into something, you don't just introduce them to the deepest aspect of the lore/subject. Unfortunately, that will only attract a narrow group
