# 2022-08-31 Request Regarding ENAS 118 Absence From Lecture

# Request: Today's ENAS 118 Lecture
Dear Professors Wilczynski and Wilen,

Greetings and hope this email finds you well. My name is Braden Wong, a prospective Computer Science major from the Class of 2024. I have been interested in taking ENAS 118 for a while, but was unfortunately unable to take this course during my first year due to COVID-19. 

Unfortunately, I missed ENAS 118’s first lecture today having seen the course's “HTBA” start time on Yale Course Search. I have recognized the 9:25AM start time in the syllabus, and was wondering if there may be anything I may do to make up for this absence, or to improve my chances of being approved for the course. I understand it is a lot of work

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Braden Wong
