# HIST 271 European Intellectual History Since Nietzsche

## Lecture 1 [[2022-09-02]]
- [[Modernity]] is about replacing God
	- Demoting, Killing, Replacing God

### Shift of Cyclical to the Linear
- [[Modernity]] leads to the idea of time moving forward
- We are moving from a Cyclical to Forward motion. See [[Linear versus cyclical history]]
- Rise of [[Subjective|subjectivity]] over [[Objective|objectivity]]
	- Instead of man being the object acted upon, it is the subject that acts
	- The idea of women also being subjects comes much later
- The [[Enlightenment]] is disenchantment—Max Weber
	- The loss of mystery
	- We lose enchantment and magic
	- It is the casting of the light on the world
	- The time of myths and magic making is over
- **Reason**—the key concept motivating the enlightenment
- We will use our reason and motivation
	- An optimistic
	- That reason and time is a good thing, and we will use it

### Teleology
- The key of all of this was the hard sciences
	- Philosophy doesn't see a clear teleology of progress, as professor describes
	- But medicine and others do, as professor's father says
		- There are some peoiple who would have died before but now
- [[Cards/Fleeting Notes/Empiricism]]

## Not a Killing Off of God, but a Gentle Off Staging
- [[Philisophes]]
	- Public intellectuals who applied reason to their study
		- Not just based off passion, but people based off reason and experience
	- Theory and praxis
	- Ask questions from state of nature to state of society
	- What state of government is best
	- See Voltaire
- Nothing bad is happening to God
	- Yes, we appreciate his gifts
	- We will not rely on magical things from God
	- Deism
	- Now, he steps off the stage and he left it up to us to do the rest
- Not Atheism, but abolish intolerance in Christianity—Voltaire
> 	_It would be easier to subjugate the entire universe_ through force _than_ the minds of a _single village_
- [[Social Contract]] and [[Hobbes]]
	- The natural state of humanity is violence and chaos. We are all nasty, broodish, and prone to murder
	- We exchange our violence for
	- Once you do it, you do not get to opt out. only if the Leviathon fails to give you that security
	- Relationship between freedom and security is a zero sum game
		- A dark vision, but Hobbes thinks it's a worthy trade
- Consent of the governed and [[John Locke]]
	- Idea of property
- The Idealized State of Nature and Jean-Jacques Rousseau
	- In contrast to [[Hobbes]], thinks we are all naturally kind and loving
	- One of the few to have **nostalgia for the state of nature**
	- Wish we could return to the state of nature, but cannot return to it
		- We have no choice but to return to the [[Social Contract]]
	- Interesting character
		- Can sound like a philosopher, romantic, etc. depending on the book
		- Was very hard to get along with, supposedly
	- [[General Will]]
		- Mystical, not mathematical, and not public opinion that is counted
		- Sum of the differences of individual wills
	- Man is born free but everywhere is in chains
		- He will never be able to return
	- Once we have property, it will corrupt it
> 	Society will only be free if he the last monarch is strangled with the guts of the last priest
- Kant's "What is Enlightenment"
	- Mendelsohn wins the essay contest, and Kant wins second contest
	- "Dare to Know"—Kant's definition of [[Enlightenment]]
	- [[Enlightenment]] is the getting out of our immaturity
		- Immaturity is letting other peopel think for us, to not use reason
		- Maturity is thinking for yourself
	- Kant is still very much for order
		- You should follow orders, but do not let the Monarch think for you

## Lecture 2 [[2022-09-07]]
- Social sciences emerged from the Enlightenment, because we believe we can understand
- Romantic revolt against the enlightenment
	- Beauty, passion, longing
	- The difference between [[Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]] is reason versus will
	- [[Enlightenment versus Romanticism]]
- The Romantics love darkness and turbulence. They are pessimists
- There is an interiority and moving inward
- Rousseau was kinda weird, yo
	- The Confessions is raunchy and quite unsettling.
- Kant tells us to reason independently
- We can never leave our mind to confirm that the world exists
	- Does the universe exist unto itself? Or is it a projection in our mind?
- In rationalism, we get to truth through our own reason without needing experience
	- In contrast to Empiricism, we don't need to get a bag of M&M's to confirm that 2 + 2
- Kant says that it is a synthesis of our brains and we need both
- [[It's not that our consciousness conforms to the object, but that the object conforms to our consciousness]]
- [[Categorical imperative]]
- [[Romantics interpret Kant for valuing intent rather than outcome]]
- It's not about being free, but becoming free
- (References:: [The data science resume that got me my FAANG (MANGA?) job (entry level data scientist) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx-x-yXXE9I))

## Lecture 3 [[2022-09-12]]
- [[Hegel]]
	- [[Hagel was a terrible writer]]
	- [[The Phenomenology of Spirit]] is an experience
	- Hagel and Kant were both fans of the French Revolution
		- Encountering of the enlightenment and romanticism
	- How do we step from inside to outside?
		- [[Brain in a vat]]
	- Hagel moves outward in a spiral
		- Towards a [[Teleology|telos]], but not in a straight line
	- [[Synchronic versus diachronic]]
		- Until then, most of philosophy was [[Synchronic versus diachronic|synchronic]]
		- Hagel puts a greater emphasis on how things evolve over time
	- There is no still, there is no quiet. You are always going somewhere, in a distressing way
	- [[Kant]] was very calm, whereas [[Hegel]] was dark and edgy
	- [[Ontology]]
	- [[Geist]] translates to "spirit" in German
	- Meaning can't come from just the particular. It comes from the whole. Spirit is the power of the whole, the [[Geist]]
		- Everythin can only be understood holistically and [[Synchronic versus diachronic|synchronically]]
	- To be alienated is to be individualistic, because everything is from the whole
	- Things can only be understood in retrospect
		- [[You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards.]]
	- The evaluation of an action can only be understood by seeing how it plays out
		- Recall that Kant said [[Romantics interpret Kant for valuing intent rather than outcome]]
		- You cannot evaluate actions solely from intent
		- Consequences are limitless, based off the boundlessness of consequence
	- [[Teleology|Telos]]
		- Apple tree, and its design is
		- The apple tree will grow into an apple
- [[Teleology versus contingency]]
	Things are dependent. It might happen, it might not. It could happen
	[[Dialectics]] is about contradictions
- Hagel is not [[subjective]], the [[Geist]] has an objective purpose stepping through
- Freedom is the recognition of necessity
- For many philosophers, [[Alienation]] is the distance between [[subjective]] and objective
	- But Hagel argues that it is our disconnection and inability to see how we fit in the whole
- To be free is nothing, to become free is everything
- [[Master slave dialectic]]
	- Importance of recognition
		- Everything is mediated through some other
		- We are never self identity. Our identity depends on the perception of others
		- Our identity is dependent on recognition
	- [[Master Slave dialectic]]
		- The slave in order to not be killed becomes a slave
		- A master looks to the slave for acknowledgement
		- The problem is that the master has relegated the slave to an object
		- The master cannot get the recognition that he needs
		- It is a way the master is slave to the slave
		- The slave is producing work, which is self-actualizing
		- The master, which does not receivie anything, is not actualized
	- Why do you want to kill a stranger? You wwho binds you
- Collapse of facts and values
	- What is good is what wins
	- Everything can be understood only at the end of the university, when we see the whole
- Exciting that Hagel was moving, and in the end it would all make sense
- Seduction of Hagel is the seduction of [[totality]]
	- And mediation. That nothing is self-identical, alone, or is what it is

## Lecture [[2022-09-14]]
- [[Dialectics]] is about contradictions and wholeness
- [[Telos]] is not just about a goal, but that an object in its essence contains its
	- Flower apple tree seed
		- Inside the apple seed is already the design of the apple tree
		- You don't plant an apple seed and get a peach tree
- [[Hegel]]
	- There's no going back
	- [[History has progression]], is linear rather than cyclical. See [[Linear versus cyclical history]].
- [[2 + 2 = 4]]
	- Is the metaphor that everyone wants that timeless certainty
	- "What if I don't want [[2 + 2 = 4]]"—Dostoevsky
- Hagel sais there is no such thing as timelessness
	- Philosophy is dependent on time
- Hagel's thoughts on [[Amorality]]
	- [[Subjective]] morality is absurd
	- Rejecting your feelings or philosohpy
	- Your feelings about "[[2 + 2 = 4]]" don't matter
	- You must accept the movement of history. [[Synchronic versus diachronic]]
- Hagel is [[Determinism]], [[Contingency]], but importantly also [[Totality]] and the seduction of wholeness
- [[Marx]]
	- How did Marxism go so wrong
	- What made it so seductive
	- [[Marx]] was a Jew
		- Was [[Marx]] a self-hating Jew?
		- Jew's relatedness to [[Capitalism]]
- [[Modernization]], [[Modernism]], and [[modernity]]
	- [[Modernity]] refers to a temporal period, a division in time
		- Antiquity, early middle age, late middle age, Renaissance, Enlightenment
	- [[Modernism]] is an aesthetic response to modernity
		- [[Modernism|Modernist]] painting, modernist philosophy, modernist poetry
	- [[Modernization]] is the technological, societal, etc. changes that come with modernization
- Marx's motivation
	- The rise of assembly line, and the distance of the worker from what they are creation
	- Shift from feudal economy to hourly wages
	- You are no longer a [[subjective]] person, but a commodity being sold per an hour
- [[Kant]] continuing [[Hegel]]
	- History has always been about class struggle
	- [[Capitalism]] [[Synchronic versus diachronic|diachronically]] overcomes [[Feudalism]]
	- [[Communism]] [[Synchronic versus diachronic|diachronically]] overcomes [[Capitalism]]
	- [[End of History]]
	- [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]] are referring to [[History with a capital H]]
- Class consciousness
	- The understanding
	- The only possible solution is for all of the workers all around the world to unite
	- Violently overthrow the [[Bourgeoisie]], violently take over, institute a transitional dictatorship of the proletariet
		- Eventually, borders wither away
		- Everyone works to their ability and receive according to their need
		- Classless utopian world
		- That is the [[End of History]]
	- This is not "it would be nice if"
		- This is about [[History with a capital H]]

## Lecture [[2022-09-19]]
### [[Nietzsche]]
- A prodigy, gets sick and unfortunately stays sick with health destroyed
- Becomes a great friend of [[Wagner]]
	- [[Wagner]] was supposedly not a good person (as [[Many historically important people are not necessarily good people]])
		- Professor's brother's opera singer teacher's anecdote about [[Wagner]] (every bad thing you hear is true)
	- Then becomes a great enemy of [[Wagner]]
- Rejected by his love interest after proposing to her from a friend
	- Devastated, for his entire life he has felt solitude
	- "[[Nietzsche]] is never tired of inveighing against women. His opinion of women, like every man's, is an objectification of his own emotion towards them, which is obviously one of fear"—[[Bertrand Russel]]
### [[Nietzsche]]'s beliefs
- Anti [[Hegel]]
- The belief that one is a latecomer of the ages is paralyzing and depressing
- He doesn't like that [[History with a capital H]] is above art, above passion
- He is still interested in becoming and self-overcoming ([[Aufheben]])
- A lot of disgust and revulsion, pleasure of pain
- Embraced [[Pain and suffering]]
	- “That which is ready to fall, shall ye also push!”
- Beyond good and evil
	- The concepts of good and evil contribute to an unhealthy view of life which judges relief from suffering as more valuable than creative self-expression and accomplishment. 
	- For this reason Nietzsche believes that we should seek to move beyond judgements of good and evil
	- Good and evil is performative rather than discovered
- Detests pity, detests compassions, and loves heroes
- Lots of self-hatred projected on women
	- Can't stand women due to the above
	- Can't stand Christianity because it is a "[[slave morality]]"
		- That you should turn the other cheek, that you should not fight back, that slaves should respect their masters
		- Morality comes to the slave that is docile and subjugated
		- Religion of the weak and subjugated and makes being weak and suffering a virtue
		- "The meek shall inherit the earth"
- [[Slave morality]] is a moral system (like Christianity, like communism, ) requiring submission to others for "the greater good" (the individual submits to the community), while [[master morality]] is individualistic: that which makes a man the master of his own destiny and fate.
### [[Nietzsche]]'s [[Übermensch]]
- One who is above man
- We must [[Aufheben]] and rise above current man
- Man's relationship to apes is what [[Übermensch]]'s relationship will be to man
- Man is tied between beast and [[Übermensch]]

### We must live dangerously
- Eternity as a dimension of time that reaffirms the present

### [[God is Dead]]
- A madman comes to deliver the news
	- He says "God is dead", "God remains dead", and "we have killed him"
	- How shall we, the murderers of all murderers, comfort ourselves?
- This is not [[Atheism]]
	- God was alive, he existed, and we have killed him. We have taken the [[agency]] in killing God
- There is no [[Telos]], no end
- People want [[totality]], some sort of wholeness, but it is not exist
- Eternity is now
- The result is a crisis called [[Nihilism]]
	- We have to reach the 
- Collapses in the street
- Moved to asylum
### Concluding thoughts
- A sort Draconian
	- Was not a German Nationalist, but going to be blamed for the origins of [[Naziism]]
	- Rebellion of the cool rational optimism of the Enlightenment
	- Pessimist
- "Nietzsche developed more penetrating knowledge of himself than any other man who ever lived, or is likely to live."—[[Freud]]
- Often read as an [[Amoral]] philosopher, but there's a hysterical mourning for morality
- [[God is Dead]] shakes up everything
	- [[Dostoevski]] writes, "If [[God is Dead]], then everything is permitted"
	
## Lecture [[2022-09-21]]
- The present is difficult for philosophy because it 2has no duration
- This is where [[Sources/Podcasts/Philosophy]] starts to overlap with [[Physics]]
	- [[Teleology]], [[Contingency]], [[Determinism]] still remain big players after Enlightenment, as well as [[Positivism]]
- [[Henri Bergson]]
	- Time is a river
	- Different between point and flow
	- A century after Enlightenment in France
	- A rebel against [[Enlightenment]] [[Positivism]]
	- A relevant between the [[Discrete versus Continuous]]. Thinking of [[Set Theory]]: an infinite continuous set of all points on a number line versus an infinite set of all of the natural numbers.
	- Dualistic thinker
		- Likes pairs of concepts that oppose each other
	- Our experience of time is quantitative, not qualitative ([[Categorical versus quantitative|Qualitative versus quantitative]])
	- When does changes in scale become changes in kind? [[Sorites paradox]]
	- What is finalism?
		- [[Teleology]]
		- The plan is predetermined, the function is inherent in the structure, [[Telos]]
		- The plan for the apple seed is already hardwired into the seed as an example of [[Telos]]
			- See [[Apple Seed Telos]]
	- Epistemological clarity that comes with laughter
- [[You know you're a crazy influential philosopher when I refer you by just last name, not full name]]

## Lecture [[2022-09-28]]
- [[Freud]]
	- Memory can cause illness and come back to bite us. This is the origin of [[Return of the repressed]]
	- Sexuality begins at birth—there is child sexuality, etc.
	- Sexuality is expansive. It doesn't have to be connected with procreation or genetals
	- Sexuality is repressed, and childhood is filled with [[Trauma]]
		- Having parents is [[Trauma|traumatic]]
		- Being born is [[Trauma|traumatic]]
	- Everything is about sexual repression
	- [[Id]], [[Ego]], [[Superego]]
		- The job of the [[Ego]] is to negotiate
		- Quite [[Hegel|Hegelian]] in that the self is in a war with itself
	- [[Freudian slip]]
