# Attachment Styles
[[Secure (60%)]] attachment style is placated and can use their mother as a stable base. When the mother returns, the baby calms down and is happy and resumes playing with toy.
[[Ambivalent (15%)]] attachment style also wants contact, but cannot be placated and often is angry. Likely caused from inconsistent presence of parenting.
[[Avoidant (20%)]] attachment style is completely disinterested once the mother leaves.
