# Analytical Gradient
Derive the actual [[Gradient]], usually using [[Back-Propagation]] or [[Calculus]], then apply.

This is more exact and faster than [[Numeric Gradient]], but error-prone.

In practice, always use [[Analytical Gradient]], but check with [[Numeric Gradient]]. This is called a [[Gradient Check]].
