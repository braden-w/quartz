# Countersignaling
Trying to show that you don't have to try.

Let's say you go to a restaurant and forget your wallet, and ask your friend to spot some cash. Your friend may say, "No Problem!". But your close friends may say, "Look at Braden, always stealing my money." The signal means the opposite of what is said, and is an expensive signal to somehow signal that you are even closer than friends.

See [[Signaling]].
