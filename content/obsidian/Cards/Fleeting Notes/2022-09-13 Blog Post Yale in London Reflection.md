# 2022-09-13 Blog Post Yale in London Reflection
1) Give an overview of your activity, including any goals you set and progress you made towards them.

The program consisted of a mixture of writing courses on both British art and country houses, as well as British music. During the program, I had a goal to be able to revisit writing English essays and memoirs – as it was something that I had not done seriously since high school.

The program was incredibly well structured and enabled our program of six students to become very close. The country house class had a field trip about 1.5 times a week, which enabled us to have something to look forward to every day. In contrast, the British music class was more spontaneous, having several excursions and frequent meetings with the professor in class. The result was one program being a backbone around which our program was given structure, and the other the heart and soul where we were able to regularly meet together and intimately discuss with the professor.

2) In what ways did your experience challenge you?

I was challenged logistically, creatively, and in my ability to write efficiently. I have never studied abroad before, never having been outside of North America for that matter, and so there were definitely challenges to acquaint myself to a new international system.

Academically, having to write around two essays a week in addition to field trips does put some logistical strain. During the field trip, I was taking an online fellowship that also required around 20 to 30 hours a week of study, so it was challenging to find time to work on both that and British courses.

The experience also challenged me on the certainty of my college trajectory. Did I really want to focus on a second major at the expense of writing classes? This challenge has led me to update my plans for the rest of my college career, in both classes and selection of extracurriculars.

3) Describe the ways in which you grew academically and/or professionally.

The program strengthened my ability to think creatively regardless of context and to pull concepts from disparate areas of the world. I also gained immense appreciation of how deep and ubiquitous London is, in both pop culture and academic circles, and have subsequently appreciated recognizing it in many of my classes, articles, etc. since. I have not been able to write in this quantity since high school, and I found myself enjoying the process once again.

4) Describe the ways in which you grew personally through this experience.

Since I first joined Yale, I have intended to fulfill my dream of traveling abroad during my Yale career. I have never traveled outside of North America, in part due to a combination of family financial and logistical complications during my childhood. Although traveling to Asia has been extremely difficult during the COVID-19 pandemic, the opportunity to travel to London under a structured curriculum at Yale is incredibly exciting and literally a dream come true. Therefore, the primary means of personal growth has been entirely emotional—actualizing a childhood fantasy.

5) Conclusion

I loved loved loved my time at Yale in London! The experience has impacted me substantially in both emotional and academic aspects. It has rekindled my desire to study English and writing, and it most definitely changed the trajectory of my life in a meaningful way.
