# Coding is to Programming Like Typing is to Writing
Writing requires mental effort. The words have some importance, but even they are secondary to the ideas that are being expressed.

Coding is the instrument to express the core ideas. Programs are built onto ideas.

> Learning to program by coding is like learning to write by learning to type. It doesn't make sense.
