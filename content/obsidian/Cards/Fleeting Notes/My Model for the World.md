# My Model for the World
Ultimately, [[Welfarism]]. I want ideas to win (see [[Meme Theory]]) and that an ideal world that maximizes the good has a better distribution of people who hold certain ideas and act upon them.

Specifically for me, this is [[Utilitarianism]]. I think pop culture gives it too strong of a bad rap and a lot of people would update towards it if they were presented it in a logical way.

I also think that [[Effective Altruism]] is highly misunderstood or underrated. An ideal world that maximizes the world would have a lot more peopel who happen to believe in at least a subset of EA ideas and act upon them.

People are too easily satisfied to help their neighbor, wtihout thinking about the broader picture. Beyond geographic and temporal proximity.

These are an example of [[Suboptimal Equilibria]].

If there are ideas where immediately after hearing, they experience [[Preference Update]], then we should pursue them.

It is funny/ironic that my theory of impact can easily be conflated with being excited ideas because they sound cool

I heard about EA and really wanted to spread the ideas

Impact and being an engineer or a doctor. Ea is a vehicle of ideas that you can use to any extent to help your career
