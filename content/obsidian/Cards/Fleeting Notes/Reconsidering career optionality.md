# Reconsidering career optionality
> The average ambitious person spends too much time accumulating optionality and too little time taking actual risks with high upside potential for themselves or the world. People often pursue optionality because they perceive that going after something big like, say, starting a company, is financially and socially risky. However, the bigger risk is not that you fail, it's that you don't get enough actual shots on goal to do something amazing.
