# To the World You May Be One Person; but to One Person You May Be the World
We overestimate what few things we can do _to_ ten people, but underestimate what enormous things we can _for_ just one. Because one person might not change the world, but changing the world for one person happens every day.

Teachers and staff, each student here is only one of thousands you’ve watched grow, but to us, you might be the only ones to ever inspire us. The first ones to help us find our passions. The only ones to mentor us. And students, we are the world to each other on so many levels — because we make new experiences together, and that’s something that’s so incredibly precious.

Believe in the impact each of you has on one person.
