# [[2021-07-08]] Post for Project YAM
Yalies! Ever wanted to meet other Yalies, but feel a bit too low-commitment to do so?

Enter Project YAM: bridging the gap for low-commitment connecting. Let's introduce you to as many people as possible, as low-effort as possible‚Äîjust enough to introduce a spark before setting foot on campus.

We're now hooked up to the Yale Facebook!

Share Spotify Playlists and IG of fellow Yalies so you get to know them ASAP.

Find Yalies near you based off location

* Your address is not disclosed. For privacy, the map zoom is limited, avatars from the Yale Facebook are disguised, and clicking any part of the map returns an list of users in the general area (not by proximity) to protect locations. User addresses are tied to cities, not addresses üç†
