# Start Negotiating When You Reach Yes-If, Not No-But
 (Yes-If we agree on terms.)  Do not start negotiating from No-But.  (No-But we might hire you anyway if you’re really, really effing cheap.)  You don’t want to work for a No-But for the same reasons that [smart employers hate hiring candidates who are a No-But](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html) (No-But maybe if not on my team, etc).  
 
 If they’re leaning to not hiring you, you will compromise excessively on negotiation to get them to hire you.  Compromising excessively is not the point of the exercise.  It is a seller’s market for talent right now: sell to someone who is happy to buy.
