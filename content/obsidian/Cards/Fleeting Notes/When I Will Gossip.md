# When I Will Gossip
I used to refuse to gossip. I wanted to [[Give Everyone a First Impression]] There is now one new condition that has updated why I would gossip: [[Gossip Evolved as a Social Incentive for Alignment]].

It is important to alert others to watch out. Gossip came about in part as a way for people to regulate the behavior of others who may be dangerous, hurt others, etc.. Sure, it can also be manipulative. But the former reasons are the conditions under which I will gossip.
