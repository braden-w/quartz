# Obsidian is a Way of Mapping What You Know
There is an infinite number of things you don't know, but a finite number of things you do know. [[Obsidian]] and other [[Knowledge Tools]] are just a means of keeping tabs on what you know.

It's like having a personal [[Wikipedia]], but you are familiar with every entry. You don't waste time on rereading and have an intense familiarity with everything.
