[Google Docs: Sign-in](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ET0sALoH5TDsxFZaymeNJ9DcBVvth7_vyZm_VeC0nSE/edit#)
[YCC Entrepreneurship Handbook - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k92uwpfNh1qlVwvJxKcvsleLPe6zZ4O4zRdZXqCKxN8/edit?usp=sharing)

## General patterns
Something interesting is seeing the [Biographies of Top Entrepreneurs from 80,000 hours](https://80000hours.org/2014/05/biographies-of-top-entrepreneurs/) pulled from [a summary of the richest tech entrepreneurs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xquJqw1Jg614g_wenoZ3JvnzUT_JAlg4hE8YtZoKui4/edit#gid=0), which is insightful. Another good book to read is [[Super Founders]], which dispells many of the myths about the origin stories of successful entrepreneurs.

## More thoughts
