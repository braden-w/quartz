# Guide to Highly Impactful Careers

## Start here
I think it's nice to distill by cause area using the [80,000 hours career guide](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/?source=email&uni_id=330). There is a longtermist skew to this.
1. AI safety technical research
2. Long-term AI Policy
3. Founder of new projects

## Already have a specialization?
You could also see the list of [socially impactful careers if you already have a strength](https://80000hours.org/articles/advice-by-expertise/?source=email&uni_id=330).

## For tech people specifically
For me, one of my favorite resources is to [Found a tech startup](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/tech-entrepreneurship/).
