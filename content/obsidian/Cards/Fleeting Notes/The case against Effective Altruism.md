# The case against Effective Altruism

## [Defective Altruism ❧ Current Affairs](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2022/09/defective-altruism/)
- Earning to Give
- Climate Change
- Pandemics
	- There's very little care about poor people receiving the same kind of care as rich people during pandemics
	- Equity doesn't matter as much
- Artificial intelligence

- I highly disagree, as [[Intelligence is information processing]]
- Very unconvinced by his writings about doubting AI, that it will not deceive or that "pocket calculators" won't end up being more or that this is just "dystopian fiction"
- [[Everyone criticizes you until you're actually right]]
	- "She notes ruefully that EA is hugely popular in Silicon Valley, where hundreds of millions of dollars are raised to allow rich people, mostly white men, to think they’re _literally saving the world_ (by stopping the hypothetical malevolent computer monster).""
