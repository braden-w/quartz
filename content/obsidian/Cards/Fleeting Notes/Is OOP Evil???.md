# Is [[OOP]] Evil???
- One of the most influential [[Videos]]
- Methods for managing state
	- procedural & imperative (the default)
	- procedural & functional (minimize state)
	- object-oriented & imperative (segregate state)
- [[Inheritance is irrelevant]]
	- There is no reason use [[Inheritance (OOP)]]
	- [[Polymorphism]] is not (exclusively) [[OOP]]
- Why does [[OOP]] dominate?
	- Management wanted cookie cutter solutions to substitute programmers
	- The real reason was [[Java]]
	- It's nice to have "auocomplete"
- Splitting things seems nice but can be bad if you need to keep track of everything. This reminds me of [[Don't race to break down components]] and [[Do not be afraid of long functions]] and [[Don't overabstract code]]
- [[Pure functions are the only truly self-contained unit of code]]
