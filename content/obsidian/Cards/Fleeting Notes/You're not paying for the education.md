# You're not paying for the education
Most universities will let you publicly view the courses they offer, and walk into the lecture at any time, no questions asked.

The reason? You aren't paying for the education. You're paying for the connections that you will get along the way, the exclusivity, etc..

I've already talked about [[The value of auditing college courses]].
