# The Great Stagnation - How America Ate All the Low-Hanging Fruit of Modern History, Got Sick, and Will (Eventually) Feel Better
- Politics has recovered far earlier than jobs
	- We have not recovered jobs in the same way, [[Jobless Recovery]]
- Republicans are often more fiscally disastrous than Democrats when running policy
- We are at a technical plateau for the past 40 years, slowing economic growth

## The Lower
1. Free fertile land
	- Ambitious workers immigrated to work the land
2. Technological Breakthroughs
	- Telephone, mass production, television, etc.

- Could you contend that discrimination is low hanging fruit?
	- Yes, but not very big fruit

> [!important]
> Eeking out marginal improvements is not the same as low hanging fruit

## Decrease in Median Income
- [[Median Income]] is the best measure
- Rate of growth slows at 1973, starting the stagnation
- If it had continued to increase, it would be be $90,000
- Financial Crisis wiped out massive 3% of median income

## The Rise of Finance
- Wealthy individuals often create financial innovations that do not translate to wealth of Average American Citizen
- Valuable ideas have become more scarce, so the small number of get farther

> [!summary]
> Recent innovation has been geared for [[Private Goods]] rather than [[Public Goods]].

The basic accoutrements of life have not changed that much in the recent years

## Healthcare
- Competence versus Feeling Good from Doctors
- America spends 17% of GDP on healthcare but no results to show

## Healthcare Productivity is Hard to Measure
- Spending more on Healthcare does not necessarily lead to longer life expectancy
- Other countries have less healthcare expenditure, but also live longer lives
	- Most plausibly from lifestyle
- Rand Corporation Study
	- Thousands of Americans were given 100% free healthcare
	- Consumed 25-30% more healthcare services
	- But except for poor, did not significantly increase health
- For surgical patients, the uninsured have better outcomes than the insured

## We Don't Know
- We don't know the effects of spending
	- Is spending more on education improving productivity?

## The Web
- The new low hanging fruit is in our minds
- Twitter, reviews, etc.
- Most web activities do not create the same economic activity as old innovation did
	- Facebook doesn't employ many people, and most of work is by servers
	- Everyone has heard of [[Twitter]], but only 300 people work there as of 2010
	- [[iPod Has Created Only 13,920 Jobs]]
- Explains the [[Jobless Recovery]]

> [!summary]
> We're having a lot more fun, but it is "cheap" fun

## The Danger of Lower Taxes
- Easy to market, but loss of government revenue leads to a death spiral (we cannot appease as easily with spending)

## Traveling, Communication Leading to Big Government and Big Business
- Traveling makes lobbying is easier
- America does not have big government
- [[Big Government and Big Business are Intertwined]]
- [[Internet Drives Inequality]]
- [[Information Technologies Increased Inequality]]

> [!summary]
> All of these knit us closer in a national scope rather than community scope

## Takeaways of Madoff
- The point is not that all banking is fraud, but that we place too much trust in the judgement of others

## Why Politicians Like Debt
- Japan is a model, but not what we expected
	- An example of a slowing economy

## We Should Give More Status to Science
 [[Borlaug Wheat]] should be more famous
