# Guide to Summer Internships
Internships have three different uses:
1. Do something you cannot ever have time to do, such as studying abroad (See [[You should study abroad]])
2. Advance yourself in a career as fast as possible
3. Explore and find out what you **do not** want to do.

See [[Jaded juniors]]
