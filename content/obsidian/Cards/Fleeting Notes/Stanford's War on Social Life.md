# Stanford's War on Social Life
> Today, most of the organizations JP remembers from Stanford are gone. The Kappa Alpha boys have been kicked out of their old house. Lake Lagunita was closed to student activities in 2001, ostensibly to protect an [endangered salamander](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Lake-Lagunita-no-longer-filled) that had taken up residence in the artificial waters. Eventually, Stanford let the lake go [dry](https://125.stanford.edu/then-and-now/990/). JP claims you can still see his island though, now a patch of elevated ground in a dry, dusty basin.

> Stanford’s new social order offers a peek into the bureaucrat’s vision for America. It is a world without risk, genuine difference, or the kind of group connection that makes teenage boys want to rent bulldozers and build islands. It is a world largely without unencumbered joy; without the kind of cultural specificity that makes college, or the rest of life, particularly interesting.
