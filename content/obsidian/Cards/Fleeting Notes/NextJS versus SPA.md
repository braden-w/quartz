# NextJS versus [[SPA]]
You can just remove `getServerSideProps()` and have a [[Create React App (CRA)]] equivalent except that the HTML more closely matches the end results.

The only thing NextJS does is add an optional earlier stage before the page loads. NextJS is a single SPA framework that happens to include server side.

[[Just because you don't need SEO doesn't mean you don't need the power of a server side framework]]

[[NextJS]] still makes SPAs once the first page loads. [[NextJS is strictly better than Create React App (CRA)]]
