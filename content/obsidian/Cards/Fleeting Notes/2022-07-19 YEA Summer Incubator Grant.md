# 2022-07-19 YEA Summer Incubator Grant

## Name
Braden Wong

## Project Information

### Short Description
How would you describe your project in one sentence (max. 120 characters)?

Please be as concrete as possible; e.g., ‘6-month salary to set up a new org providing career advice for social impact to uni students through online content’ rather than ‘Working towards a future where more people pursue careers for the greater good’.

2.5-month .7 FTE grant for community builders founding existential risk/longtermist club & developing YEA infrastructure

### Summary

### Please Provide a Brief Summary of Your Project (max. 1000 characters). We Will Use This Summary to Pre-screen Your Application, so Please Make Sure to Include the Key Reasons in Favor of Your Project Here. If You Have Already Talked to a Particular Fund Manager, Please Mention Their Name Here so We Can Be Sure to Get Their Input.
An accelerator program for promising community builder to give YEA a logistical head start before the school year begins. YEA often began past school years with less than 2 weeks to plan the fellowship, socials, and speaker events. This cold start led to suboptimal outcomes, such as fewer speaker events (about 2 per semester).

We believe we can substantially increase the number of events and offerings with some planning. We will take on tasks of critical importance, such as speaker events, as well as tasks that YEA members often say are “really nice to have”, but table during the school year due to more pressing logistics. These involve documentation, Slack, Asana, etc.

One executive member, Braden Wong, will be managing a team of 6 high-potential community builders and report weekly to the YEA Exec. Detailed tasks and agendas in next section.

Thomas and I attempted to reach out to Emma Williamson but did not get a response. The project has been vetted by the YEA Exec Team. 

### Project Goals
What specific actions or steps might your project involve? What impact will this have on the world? What is your project’s goal, how will you know if you’ve achieved it, and what is the path to impact? How does this relate to the goals of the fund(s) you are applying to?

The detailed agendas and meeting notes for this initiative can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IDCjCw8TOlJ2f_9zWKE9rdoQRzFVa0uu2DsPZx0G0ws/edit?usp=sharing

The project aims to profoundly shift YEA’s ability to encourage promising students to pursue high-impact careers.

Tasks can be grouped in three broad categories:

- Locking Event Itinerary for YEA for 2021-2022 School Year

- This is important because YEA’s first events of the semester were often delayed due to advance planning.

- Overhaul and standardize the guest-speaker pipeline. We will consolidate the list of speaker and reach out to all of them during the summer (as opposed to during the school year)

- Founding an x-risk/longtermism aligned club

- Fully Investigate the Yale Club Application Process and Submit Application

- If the club does not get approved, it will become a reading group within YEA

- Start curriculum for an Intro Fellowship (or equivalent)

- General “Nice To Have” Tabled Tasks

- Revamp the YEA Website

- Create social media presence on Instagram

- Create new Slack communication channels. At minimum, 1. Cause Specific Channels, 2. A Channel Encouraging Giving, and 3. A Channel Encouraging Criticisms of EA. These channels will create discussions of altruism and open-mindedness

- Create an Internal Notion Database for the entirety of YEA

- Create an EA-oriented alumni and career-building network on Linkedin

- Overhauling any other aspects of YEA infrastructure

These are all tasks that either are 1. Immediately important (such as speaker events) or 2. Are always tabled during the regular school year in favor of other more pressing logistical issues.

Members are selected based off ability demonstrated during the 2021-2022 school year and summer availability.

### Track Record
What is your track record for running projects of this kind?

Please give us an outline of previous successes and failures that would help us understand your (or your organization’s) ability to execute this specific project. For example, campaigns you’ve implemented, products you’ve built, research you’ve published, or relevant professional and volunteering experience.

Alternatively, what other kind of evidence do you have that the organization or project will succeed? If you are applying for a project that is related to a previous EA Funds grant, please elaborate on how your previous grant/project went.

Braden Wong

- 2-year student community builder who spent the last 2 semesters on a 10+ hour per week community grant. 

- Last semester, I was the board manager and led a team of four new student organizers in planning for YEA Bulldog Days, Yale’s incoming first-year event. We obtained over 170 email signups and over 40 fellowship signups, which has increased our email list size by 20% and doubled our fellowship pool this summer (42 applications). The event was a smashing success

- Before this, I led a fellowship team as fellowship manager. This meant coordinating curriculum, events, and discussion facilitatation for 30+ fellows per semester in Yale EA's Introductory Fellowship Program.

- Before this, I worked on the old YEA Website and was a first year liason who led all planning for Bulldog Days (admitted students recruiting)

- Before college, I was the class president and then schoolwide executive president for all 4 years in a high school with about 4000 students. This entailed being ultimately responsible for 43 students and planning a schoolwide event per month

- Facilitated 7 cohorts of Introductory and Career Intensive Fellowships.

- I was the first high school student to attend the YEA Fellowship in Summer 2020. I was also recommended to the Oxford In-Depth Fellowship in the same summer, becoming a board member the following fall

- Currently a fellow of the Machine Learning Safety Scholars program run by Dan Hendrycks and Thomas Woodside

Six Community Builders

The six community builders have all been intensely active with YEA for at least 1 year. They are selected based off ability demonstrated during the 2021-2022 school year and summer availability. All of them are YEA intro fellowship graduates, and half are YEA In-Depth Fellowship graduates.

1. Sarah Shapiro: Single-handedly planned the entire speaker event itinerary of Spring 2022. She plans an average of three speaker events per month for another Yale club, and has lots of experience on the process. Will be focused on Speaker Event Planning for the Summer

2. Koray Akduman: Active participant in EA Conferences with a strong interest in X-Risk related areas and founding a longtermism club. Assisted with YEA Bulldog Days Planning

3. Alvin Delgado: Planned the entire speaker event itinerary of Fall 2022. Speaker event planner and most senior members. Played a pivotal role in YEA Bulldog Days Planning, specifically logistics

4. Alicia Cazares: Webmaster and marketing coordinator. Adept with almost all YEA internal tools and played a pivotal role in communications during the Intro Fellowship. Assisted in YEA Bulldog Days Planning

5. Gian Luca Reti: YEA Social Chair adept at event planning. Played a pivotal role in YEA Bulldog Days Planning, specifically brainstorming and logistics

6. Will Aarons: In-Depth Fellow and Facilitator. Played a pivotal role in YEA Bulldog Days Planning, specifically brainstorming.

Yale Effective Altruism

- YEA has several executive board members on community building grants and expanded substantially in the past year. Our summer intro fellowship sizes have increased almost threefold since Summer 2021, and our email list is currently over 1200 students.

### Funding
How much funding are you requesting, and how do you intend to spend it?

We suggest applying for a range of amounts, from the minimal amount necessary to successfully implement your project, to the largest amount such that no extra money would buy any additional happiness or productivity. Please ignore the fund's current balance: if a request exceeds our available funding, we will suggest a lower grant amount or fundraise from additional donors, rather than rejecting your application.

We also suggest that you build a buffer into your budget (e.g. 10-20% of the total budget). We find that applicants systematically underestimate the real costs of their project.

Please specify the currency your request is denominated in.

Please also provide a very rough breakdown of your budget (e.g., "45% on salary for me for 6 months, 35% for payroll insurance/tax, 10% for a contractor, 10% on software and other expenses"). If you prefer, you can provide a range of values or specify multiple scenarios. If you are applying as an individual and this grant is a primary source of income, please ensure you are applying for the full payroll cost including self-employment taxes ([more info](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/help/1lZgor0q3CImJwTt0xefPR)). If you do include a buffer, please state that explicitly in your funding breakdown.

$8400 USD

7 members working for 4 hours a week for 10 weeks

7 members x 4 hours x 10 weeks x $30/hour= $8400

Budget

100% Community Builder Salary for 7 Members for 2.5 Month (0.7 FTE)

### Alternatives to Funding
What would you likely do if we decided not to fund your project?

Are you seeking funding from other funders? If so, how likely do you think that funding is to come through? Would your project go ahead if we didn’t fund it?

No immediate alternatives during this summer. Ideally find an alternative funding source in Yale Effective Altruism, given that students are community building. The project goes ahead regardless of funding decision. 

### Use for Additional Funding
What would you do if we gave you more money than you have requested?

Direct deposit into Yale Effective Altruism funds or x-risk/longtermist club (if the club is approved in time), for use in future events (most likely the speaker events locked in during the summer)

## How Did You Hear About EA Funds?
This question is required

Recommended to apply here by Thomas Woodside.

I was encouraged to apply to EA Funds after participating in the US Organizer Retreat in 2021 organized by Jessica McCurdy. I have additionally been encouraged by executive members on YEA to apply for EA funding during the summer in the absence of Community Building Grants.
