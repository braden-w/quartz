# The Wildest [[Alternate History]] Question ([[World War I]])
The wildest alt history is "what if WWI hadn't happened?" Even if other wars would've happened, what else could it have looked like? The geopolitical landscape today--the ideologies, coalitions, alliances and rivalries--is so firmly rooted in WWI and WWII that it feels impossible to imagine what the world would look like today.
