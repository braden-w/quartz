# [[Evergreen notes]] are good for "frontier work"
> The fact that evergreen notes don't reflect the mental maps of one's mind (Zettelkasten notes also don't, for that matter) is at least partially by design. Andy Matuschak writes that "[notes should surprise you](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Notes%20should%20surprise%20you)":
>
> If reading and writing notes doesn’t lead to surprises, what’s the point? If we just wanted to remember things, we have spaced repetition for that. If we just wanted to understand a particular idea thoroughly in some local context, we wouldn’t bother maintaining a system of notes over time.

> Quoting the [page](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/extend-your-mind-and-memory-with-a-zettelkasten/) from the official Zettelkasten website:

> If you look something up in your _Zettelkasten,_ you need to get unexpected results in order to form new thoughts. Surprise is the key ingredient here, as I pointed out in my [introductory post](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-improves-thinking-writing/) on this topic. The links between notes make this possible since you’ll generate new ideas by following connections and exploring a part of your web of notes. The non-apparent connections are generally more beneficial to creative thinking than the obvious ones as they generate greater surprise. While your mind usually continues to work with the obvious, your _Zettelkasten_ instead shows you the bizarre. It sparks your imagination and blows your mind as it confronts you with the unexpected.

> It's important to note here is that both Andy Matuschak and Niklas Luhmann use their note-taking systems for doing original research, whereas at least 80% of my notes are unoriginal and reflect ideas and concepts I learn from books and elsewhere. I use the evergreen note system for learning a practice or a domain and as my [external memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_memory_(psychology)). My main goals are improving and increasing my memory capacity, making thinking and recalling things faster and more reliable (not forgetting things I shouldn't forget about).

> Therefore, it seems to me that while evergreen notes and Zettelkasten are good systems for doing original research or "frontier thinking", **these note-taking systems are not optimal for training one's mind in fluent and reliable thinking in terms of a certain (professional) practice** (for example, deliberating about security threats when considering certain IT solutions: a practice of security engineering) **or learning the existing body of knowledge in a certain domain** (for example, quantum computing).
