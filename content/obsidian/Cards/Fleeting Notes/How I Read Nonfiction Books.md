# How I Read Nonfiction Books
> While I love reading [nonfiction](https://amir.rachum.com/blog/2019/03/16/nonfiction/) books, over time I realized I have very little retention of most books I’ve read in the past. While I wouldn’t say it was a waste of time1, I wanted to have better recall of what I read.

> [[Your Brain is Literally a Neural Network. Your Attitude Towards the World Can Change Imperceptibly, Ever-so-slightly Changing Weights When Accepting New Training Data, Even if the Original Input is Gone.|Don't Worry About Retaining Everything]]

> [[Talking to Myself|It’s one of my theories that when people give you advice, they’re really just talking to themselves in the past. This book is me talking to a previous version of myself.]]
