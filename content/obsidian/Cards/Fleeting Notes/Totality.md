# Totality
Every stage or phase or moment is partial, and therefore partially untrue. Hegel's grand idea is "**totality**" which preserves within it each of the ideas or stages that it has overcome or subsumed. Overcoming or subsuming is a developmental **process** made up of "moments" (stages or phases). The **totality** is the **product** of that process which preserves all of its "moments" as elements in a structure, rather than as stages or phases.
