# Marginal rate of substitution (MRS)
Slope of the [[Indifference curve (IC)]].

$$=\frac{dx_2}{dx_1} = -\frac{MU_1}{MU_2}$$
Where $MU_1 = \frac{\partial U}{\partial x_1}$ and $MU_2 = \frac{\partial U}{\partial x_2}$



MRS is equal to $\frac{p_1}{p_2}$. This means after solving $\lambda$, you can just divide both $\lambda$'s to get $\frac{p_1}{p_2}$'
