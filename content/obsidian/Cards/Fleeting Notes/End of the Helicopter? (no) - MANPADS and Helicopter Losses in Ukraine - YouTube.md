# End of the Helicopter? (no) - MANPADS and Helicopter Losses in Ukraine - YouTube

## Helicopters Are Fragile
- Sources suggest [[The US lost more than 5,500 helicopters in Vietnam]]
- Three hundred plus helicopters lost in Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
- Hundreds of helicopters lost in Iraq and Afghanistan majority to accidents, not hostile fire
- Mogadishu humble RPG
- Hollywood may be onto something hereâ€¦

## Lots of Things Can Kill Them
- Helicopters are vulnerable to almost anything that can hit them and there are a lot of things out there that can hit them if given the chance
- Peopel have used many different things to destroy helicopters (anti-tank weapons)
	- Consider [[How an F-15E Scored an Air to Air Kill with a Bomb]]
- More expensive ground based systems lack cost advantages of MANPADS but are also much more capable
- Non-dedicated systems also pose a threat, as experience in Ukraine and earlier demonstrates

## Uses of a Helicopter
- Carrying troops across mountaintops
- Flexible weapons platform
