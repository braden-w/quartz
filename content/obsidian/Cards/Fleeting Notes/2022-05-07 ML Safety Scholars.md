## Why Do You Want to Participate in This Program? *
I am drawn to the ML Safety Scholars program as a catalyst for my pursuit of [[AI Governance]] and possible other careers in the field. I believe that while the potential impact of AI is immense, so too are the risks associated with its development and implementation. I also believe that we have a responsibility to future generations, and through the ML Safety Scholars program, I hope to develop a deep understanding of the technical basis of responsible AI development, an experience that will be invaluable in my future career, whether it be in the tech industry, community building, or policy.

My introduction to [[Effective Altruism]] was originally through Artificial Intelligenceâ€”after reading [[Life 3.0]], I was deeply compelled that artificial intelligence should developed safely and responsibly to avoid catastrophic risks to humanity's future. Subsequent readings like the Precipice, discussions like the US Organizer Retreat, and experiences like using GPT3 firsthand have updated me towards Policy and AI, leading me to change change my major to "[[Ethics, Politics, and Economics]]" and "[[Computer Science and Psychology]]" and partake in a reading group for AI Governance this semester on top of other fellowships and responsibilities in Yale Effective Altruism.

I hope that my background and interests will productively contribute to the program. I've heard about this program numerous times from Thomas Woodside, whom I work with in Yale Effective Altruism. Additionally, my 80,000 Hours Career Advising call with Habiba strongly advocated for me to apply for this program (incidentally, this call took place on the day the program was released). I'm excited to where this goes!

## What Has Your Experience with Online Class Been Like? *
I strongly prefer online classes over in-person ones. During the COVID shift to online learning in my first year, I was able to comfortably take 5.5 and 6.5 credits over the recommended 4 credits, and overload my summer with internships:

First Semester: 5.5 Credits (5 course, 1 of which was a daily language class), in addition to YEA Executive team and other extracurriculars
Second Semester: 6.5 Credits (6 courses, 1 of which was a daily language class), in addition to YEA Executive team and other extracurriculars
Summer 2021: Three internships and two summer courses, one of which was a language class which met twice a day.

I also performed better on those virtual courses compared to in-person ones this year (although I have also updated away from optimizing for A's in classes this year in favor of EA community building and other activites).

The move to virtual programming was the strongest contributor to me learning software engineering and encountering Effective Altruism. It was during my remote second semester that I learned how to program and build programs through online Youtube tutorials, gaining competence quickly enough to land a software engineering job that summer. Virtual courses in my final semester of high school also enabled me to engage with online EA materials.

To qualify, I really enjoy in person discussions with smaller groups and being able to talk to my classmates. However, historically, most of my learning outside of class (information that is still useful today) has taken place in an online setting. It is plausible that I have a comparative advantage in this setting. Unlike my first-year summer, I have kept my sophomore summer open and free from all internships these past months to reserve it for personal exploration.

## Describe Your Previous Involvement with Effective Altruism, if Any. *
A heavily involved community builder for Yale Effective Altruism, currently on a 10+ hour a week [[Community Building Grant]]. As a former fellowship manager and current board manager, I was responsible for organizing and executing the fellowship program, speaker series, and incoming first-year students programming this year. Recently, we able to double our fellowship size and facilitate 150+ signups on our newsletter during Bulldog Days, our admitted students weekend.

I've been involved in Effective Altruism since high school, completing the YEA [[Intro Fellowship]] and [[Oxford In-Depth Fellowship]] before my first year of college and serving in the board and executive team ever since. The opportunity to serve in YEA has been a wonderful opportunity to leverage my leadership experience (specifically, I was student council president for a 3500-student high school for four years) and introduce EA to students. Now, I place a particular emphasis on a mix of fellowship programs, which elicits commitment from students, and workshop and incoming student events, which are more hitscan in approach.

I'm a big fan of the courses' coworking sessions, as I've found incredible effectiveness in implementing YEA board coworking sessions, which has replaced board meetings and addressed commitment problems we have had with past board members. Yale students are particularly difficult to get commitment from (especially outside of meetings), and coworking sessions has solved this issue while allowing me to provide mentorship for other board members. I've also noticed that my productivity dramatically improves in these sessions when my questions are able to be immediately addressed by other students.
