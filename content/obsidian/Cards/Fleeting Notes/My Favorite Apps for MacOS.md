- Brave Browser

- Obsidian

- Todoist

- Actually, [[Obsidian]] is very beginner friendly. It’s just that if you have a experience with git or vim, it’s even better
- It’s much faster than Google Drive since everything is plain text. Great place to store ideas
- just know that there is no built in “version history”. You can use Git (almost every developer knows how to use Git, but not everyone knows Git), or one of their paid solutions
