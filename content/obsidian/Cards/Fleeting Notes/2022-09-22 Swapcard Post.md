# 2022-09-22 Swapcard Post
I'm an Ethics, Politics, and Economics major from Yale University who loves building things and is drawn to tech and policy as two avenues to do the most good. Currently dabbled in a lot of software engineering, where I like to rapidly prototype and test new ideas, but I also really enjoy creative writing, Legos, and philosophical conversations. Interested in software engineering, AI governance, and applications in government and politics.

Inspired by [[2022-09-14 LinkedIn About Braden Wong]].
