# 2022-09-15 Email to Zhengdong about Careers
**Subject:** Request: Fan of Your Blog Asking to Connect about Advice on Life Stuff

Dear Zhengdong,

Greetings and hope this email finds you well! My name is Braden Wong, a junior majoring in Ethics, Politics, and Economics at Yale. I have been a big follower of your blog. I’m friends with Bilal Moin, a former member of the YDA, and have been a frequent visitor since he introduced it to me.

In line with your blog, I wanted to send an email and was wondering if we could chat sometime. I have some career uncertainties, and I’m particularly interested on your perspective on life stuff, career, and your relationship with Effective Altruism (I think you mentioned it on your blog somewhere).

I recently had a realization last summer that led me to drop my second major (Computer Science and Psychology) in order to take a handful of classes that would be personally fulfilling—specifically courses to train writing and building stuff with my hands. This revelation also had me reconsider how I engage with Effective Altruism, which I had been heavily involved with in leadership. However, I cannot help but feel a little loss aversion about potential career doors that I may be missing out on without a Computer Science degree.

My concerns are irrational—I think, for example, that if I were to give advice to others, I would endorse the path I’m taking. I’ve seen your blog and believe that there are other ways to signal competence in a subject without majoring it. So I think my amorphous request is more along the line of reassurance and emotional support—that my decision is most likely the right one, and that things will be okay.

I’m particularly drawn to tech, policy, and doing the most good—for now, my strategy is to gain career capital and technical skills in tech, as it seems much easier to go from tech to policy than the other way around. Should it be helpful, I’ve attached my resume to this email.

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Best,

Braden Wong
