# “Let That Sink In. Your Time and Life is Much More Valuable Than You think."
- Warren Buffet is worth over 100 billion dollars
	- Yet, nobody in this room would want to trade places with him
	- If we aren't willing to trade places with one of the richest people in the world, what does this say?
- We value our time on this earth more than 100 billion dollars
- [[On a Macro Level, We Value Our Life. On a Micro Level, We Devalue it Every Single Day.]]
