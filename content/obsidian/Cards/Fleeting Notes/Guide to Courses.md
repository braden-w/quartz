# Guide to Courses
[[Bluebooking makes you less well rounded]]

At the end of the day, courses matter, not majors.

## My Sense is That No Matter What I End up Doing, Taking CS 201 This Semester Makes Sense. Does That Seem Right to You?
Actually, I increasingly recommend people against 201 in favor of 223 or CS50 haha

since [[Prereqs Are a Joke]], if you took AP CS A you should be well-prepared for 223. CS50 has more applicable real world skills

the prof may recommend 201 still, but really,
there are super smart ppl in CSPC 323 and 366 who have no idea what HTML is

yes, 223 absolutely is. 201 has zero transferable skills
the prof may recommend 201 still, but really, I only recommend it if you are a first year and want friends
