# Referral Request Template
"Hey {name}! My name is Braden, and I'm interested in applying to {company} this year for {position}. It's an enormous favor to ask, but I was wondering if you would be [[Getting to No|opposed]] to writing me a referral this yearâ€”[[if and only if]] you feel comfortable doing so. I'm sure your schedule is really busy, and I understand if you are unable to write for me. Happy to provide information as desired, and my resume is attached. If you would like more information, I would also be open to arranging an informational meeting. Thank you so much for your time and consideration, and have a great day!"

From [[Writeup Snippets#Template]].
