# Why Women Victims Tear Down Other Women
It's surprisingly not uncommon for women victims to tear down other victims of [[Domestic Violence]].

Women may not believe other women witnesses because it diminishes their account of their experience. They express anger at other women who speak out because they are "ruining my [[Credibility]]."

Survivors are experts in their experience, but not necessarily all experiences of gender based violence. Some will rank other survivor stories abused on how similar they are to their own, which is a [[Bias (B)]].

Women distance themselves from survivors due to a belief in [[Just World Theory]]

[[Under Just World Theory, It's Easier to Blame the Victim Than it is the Perpetrator]]

## Why Women Juries Are More Likely to Acquit Gender-based Violence Trials ([[Just World Theory]])
It can be scary, and for victims, [[Trauma|re-traumatizing]], to [[Empathy|empathize]] with an abuse survivor. If violence really **is** everywhere and it **feels** like it can happen to anyone, then a lot of women will worry that they will be next.
