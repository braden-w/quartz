# Dragon Story
A [[Dragon]] takes a few people from a civilization every year. This happens for several centuries. One day, they realize that their technology is good enough to kill the [[Dragon]], and they do it. They wonder why they didn't do it sooner.

A metaphor for our relationship with [[Death]].
