# Yoga Nidra
In [this clip](https://podclips.com/c/andrew-hubermans-morning-routine-yoga-nidra-hydrate-sun-exposure-walk?ss=medium), Andrew states:

> “There are some interesting data published showing that these yoga nidra meditations, if you will, can upregulate some of the neurotransmitters in the brain, including dopamine, that make you prepared for action.”

Here’s one more benefit. In [this podcast clip](https://podclips.com/c/yoga-nidra-facilitates-relaxation-helps-people-fall-asleep?ss=medium), Andrew says:

> “There was this lure in the yoga nidra community that 30 minutes of yoga nidra is equivalent to 4 hours of sleep. Frankly, I don’t think there’s any evidence for that specific statement. But when I started doing this practice and exploring it, I found that I would come out of a 30-minute yoga nidra session feeling like I slept 5, 6 hours or longer.”
