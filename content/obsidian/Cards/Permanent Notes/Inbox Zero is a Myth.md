# [[Inbox Zero]] is a Myth
It's ok to decide to not take notes sometimes.

All productivity systems ([[Fleeting Notes]] and [[Permanent Notes]] in [[Zettelkasten]], Backlog in Agile, GTD, etc.) all have flows for phases of note/task finalization but ignore the main bottleneck: organizing sucks.

[[The speed of processing notes is the biggest bottleneck for productivity]]
