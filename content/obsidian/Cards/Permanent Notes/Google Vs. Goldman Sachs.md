# [[Google]] Vs. [[Goldman Sachs]]
**Related To:** [[What Do I Want to Do?|Career Plans]] ,

> I know 4 people who’ve worked at both places, so I’ll tell you what I’ve gathered from my interaction with them.
>
> (I shall also assume that you’re comparing Technology roles in both organisations, since nothing has been specified.)
>
> -   Learning on the Job : Pick Google. Ultimately Google is a Tech company where the focus will be mostly on Tech. Goldman is majorly revamping its Tech division as we speak and making some interesting advances in ML and AI, but in the end of the day, the bankers and traders are the main revenue generators. Google will also provide you with more intriguing projects.
> -   Career Growth: Easier to get promoted within GS’ tech division as the path is pretty clearly defined in terms of time-frames and the targets you need to achieve within those time-frames.
> -   Exit Opportunities : If you want to remain in Tech for the long term, pick Google. If you want to switch industries later, GS is the better option as you can learn about finance and investing whilst on the job.
> -   Work Life Balance: Pick Google.
> -   [[Compensation]]: Very comparable salaries at the junior level. I’m unaware of the salary figures for senior executives.
