# 2022-02-28 Individual Email to Buttery Managers
Request: Grab a Plate!

Hey Joseph, it's Braden! We met earlier this week through Tucker Moses—I'm from the Yale Buttery Book and now YCS!

I was wondering if you would be interested in grabbing a meal sometime this week! I'm interested in chatting about life in general and your experiences as a buttery manager—I'm collecting feedback and really would like to see any way our services can help you out!

Grab a plate with me https://calendly.com/braden-w/grab-a-plate?back=1&month=2022-03 or schedule a 30-minute meeting with me here https://calendly.com/braden-w/30min?month=2022-02&back=1.
