# [[2022-03-05 Effective Altruism Retreat Ideas]] Ideas for FTX Future Fund and [[Effective Altruism]]
- Accurate representation of Effective Altruism
	- Distancing from Peter Singer
- Dating within EA (or beyond EA)
- Robust 1-1 outreach to Yale EA
- Billionaire outreach (Elon Musk) and other celebrities who are good fits
- EA Sub Organizations (Branching Out)
	- Cause-area specific clubs
- Forecasting Debate

## My Topic
- We need to actively go and address criticisms of Effective Altruism
- Centralized place to address EA criticisms
- More coursework
	- Dev Econ Certificate
	- Impactful Engineering

## Why is This Project Idea Worth Listing on Our Website?
Our mission is to reduce the number of incorrect or inconsistent understandings of Effective Altruism due to inaccurate representations, misinformation, outdated resources, etc.. A significant point of consideration is ensuring that Effective Altruism's representation is modern: some courses at Yale University currently introduce Effective Altruism in its earlier versions, and I have personally met five individuals who had very outdated conceptions of EA from their coursework. Ensuring that individuals have a positive impression of EA from media can be useful for expanding the movement.

## Are There Any Reservations You Have About Listing This Idea on the Website?
It could be difficult to do PR for the broader EA movement given how broad it is, compared to letting smaller organizations to manage their own PR on a granular level. However, a team which actively seeks out to make sure that representation of the broader Effective Altruism movement is accurate could be useful.
