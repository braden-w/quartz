# Quantum Bogosort
> Quantum bogosort is a hypothetical sorting algorithm based on bogosort, created as an [in-joke](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/In-joke "In-joke") among computer scientists. The algorithm generates a random permutation of its input using a quantum source of entropy, checks if the list is sorted, and, if it is not, destroys the universe. Assuming that the [many-worlds interpretation](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Many-worlds_interpretation "Many-worlds interpretation") holds, the use of this algorithm will result in at least one surviving universe where the input was successfully sorted in _O_(_n_) time.[[9]](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bogosort#citenote10)
