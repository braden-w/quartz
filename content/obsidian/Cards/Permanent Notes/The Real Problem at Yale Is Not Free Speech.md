# The Real Problem at Yale Is Not Free Speech
**Related To:** [[Social Hierarchy|Social Class]], , ,

> But this low number of 2% surprised me because when I was at Yale, everybody kept talking about how broke they were.

> “Want to go out for brunch?” “I can’t—I’m so broke.” This was a common line. Sometimes the conversations had a more accusatory tone. “Wow, you took a taxi to the airport? I always take the subway.”

> Poor people—actually poor people—don’t talk this way. They tend to stay under the radar because they don’t know the rules of the game. But I bought it—at least when I was a freshman. If they were constantly announcing how broke they were, my assumption was that they must have even less money than I do.

## Pretending to Be Poor is a Lot Easier Than Pretending to Be Rich
> Pretending to be poor is a lot easier than pretending to be rich—just because there are so many different ways to be poor. But there are still small quirks you have to get right. Social class doesn’t just influence how you walk and talk; it influences how you interact with others. The stereotype is that poor people are improper—but sometimes it is the opposite. They try to do things as they think they are meant to be done. Spending a hundred hours building bat wings for a Halloween costume. Renting a limo for their child’s prom.

## **The Benefits Of Being Poor**
The usual answer is that rich people need safety. A Saudi billionaire wants to avoid being kidnapped, so he keeps a low profile. But that same Saudi billionaire still needs to demonstrate his status somehow to make friends and business contacts.

There were bodyguards at Yale who lived in nice, off-campus apartments next to their assigned student’s off-campus penthouse. These students were briefed by their parents about what to discuss publicly, and what to keep private. The point was to disguise their status-signals, so they would appear to be smaller targets. These are the hyper-rich.

What about the regular rich? Not the children of billionaires, but the children of millionaires. The common impulse is to emulate the people one or two levels above you—so they might also act poorer than they are. But whereas the super-rich learned purposeful discretion from their parents at weekly dinner table meetings, the regular rich did not. They learned it through mimicry—and with varying degrees of success. The less sophisticated copycats end up brazenly proclaiming that they are “broke” and “upper-middle class.”

For some people, this isn’t an act; they actually believe this. After all, they do seem poor when compared to the hyper-rich. They can’t afford spontaneous Spring Break trips to private Bali islands. They see their prep-school classmates’ Facebook photos and realize that they are one, or maybe two, pegs down from that, and so they use the term “upper-middle class” without really knowing what this term refers to. They have no idea how the actual upper-middle class, the middle class, or the poor really live. Those students never went to their prep school, so for all intents and purposes, they do not exist. Like Krasnoyarsk, Siberia—we know it exists. We can find it on a map. But we don’t need to concern ourselves with it. Often, this is what the real poor are to rich people—they are a theoretical construct that exists somewhere else.

## Poor People Pretend to Be Rich to Look Cool.
> Go visit the Russians on Brighton Beach in their tank tops and gold chains. Rich people pretend to be poor to fit in. Go to San Francisco and play a round of “Homeless or tech billionaire.”

## Yale Was Started Because Harvard Wasn't Public Enough
Yale is different from other Ivy League schools in that its history is rooted in public service. It started in 1701, when a few ministers were disappointed by Harvard and left to start a more pure, more good, more proper university. There is a reason why Harvard’s motto is “Veritas”—truth, whereas Yale’s motto is “Lux et veritas”—light and truth. Truth without light is pointless. Knowledge without an aim is at best not useful—and at worst, destructive.
