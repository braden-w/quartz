# [[2022-05-28]] Email to Cormac Thorpe to Join the YEA Summer Incubator
Hey Cormac! 

My name is Braden, from YEA! I’m following up on your request to join the YEA Board!

I'm kicking off the YEA Summer Incubator this week, which is basically the YEA Board during the summer! Incubator sessions are going to be flexible coworking sessions where you will have time to work on YEA Projects (to be determined in our meetings). I'll be present to communicate and answer any questions, and other YEA members will be there to float ideas around. I'll be taking attendance so you won't need to come to all of meetings! At the end of the summer, I will apply for an infrastructure grant at the CEA rate of $30 an hour. 

Is your summer too busy for a YEA commitment? If you think you might have availability, could you join [#summer-incubator](https://yaleea.slack.com/archives/C03F3K0L43E) in the YEA Slack and fill out the [Doodle poll](https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/b4xg6Qgb) with your weekly availability? Additionally, grab a 1-1 with me in my [Calendly](https://calendly.com/braden-w).

I’m sure this is a bit short notice and fast—please don’t feel any obligation or pressure to join yet! We always can sync up during the fall. I also would like to meet up with you first, so that we can discuss your interests and projects that might interest you in the future.

Best,
Braden Wong
