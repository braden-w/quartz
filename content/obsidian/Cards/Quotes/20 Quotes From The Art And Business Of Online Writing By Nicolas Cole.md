Today is the 1 year anniversary of [_The Art and Business of Online Writing_](https://amzn.to/3mI8vBT)_._

I started writing this book right at the beginning of the pandemic. I was stuck at home. I had just scaled back my ghostwriting agency, Digital Press. And all of a sudden, I had a ton of time on my hands. It had also been almost 4 years since I had published my first book, [_Confessions of a Teenage Gamer_](https://amzn.to/3kCjvhB), which was a memoir about my teenage years as a professional World of Warcraft player.

It took me 4 years to write my first book.

And it took me 4 months to write my second one.

# Why My 2nd Book Took 10x Less Time to Write:
I started writing my first book my senior year of college. And back then, I still subscribed to the belief system that in order to be “a writer,” you needed to bleed your way through whatever work of art was currently in focus. In some strange, almost masochistic way, the longer that first book took me to write (and the more chapters I re-wrote and re-wrote), the “better” I thought it was.

It wasn’t until I hit publish and sent it out into the world that I realized how wrong I’d been.

All I’d done was making the process harder for myself.

With my second book, _The Art and Business of Online Writing_, I decided to start eating my own dog food (which are the same principles I teach other writers in [Ship 30 for 30](https://www.ship30for30.com), a cohort-based masterclass helping people start writing online).

All my success writing on the Internet—accumulating 100 million+ views, being published in major publications like Harvard Business Review, having my own column with _Inc Magazine_, and going viral hundreds and hundreds of times—hadn’t been me following the same playbook as Hemingway, Faulkner, or Dostoevsky.

My success in the digital world had come from my invention of a new rulebook for myself.

- One where I didn’t hide my work away from the world for four years—instead, I Practiced In Public and published works-in-progress on social sites like Quora and Medium.
- One where I wrote, clarified, and refined my topics with my audience as I went.
- One where instead of aiming for “perfect,” I started aiming for “good enough, quickly.”

As a result, my 2nd book outsold my first book by a wide margin. And _The Art and Business of Online Writing_ has since gathered a cult-like following in the realm of emerging digital writers.

Here are some of my favorite quotes from the book, visualized.

# 1. Give Away 99% of Your Best Writing for Free. Monetize the Last 1%.
