Valedictorian Speech Ideas
Thursday, November 30, 2017

5:41 PM

 

Racetrack is where gambling is
Fall for the gamblers fallacy, because it does get better
How did you get here? I set up a bunch of gambles that paid off
But no risk, high reward
We act as if it is the end when we don't win, but in reality what do you lose?
All or nothing
Violin 3x, Tennis 3x, ASB Middle school lost
I never was luckier
I just held on longer
Studies show they're never luckier. They just maximize the returns when they get lucky.
Which risks will you take?
 

# Val Speech Draft
The biggest risk is not taking one
Nobody ever forgets your successes.
There is no risk, massive payoff.
Persistance is how you game the game.
 
… Didn't make me special 
But I am special
And so are everyone in this room

 Val Speech Draft

**No relationship is bilateral. It's easy to offer help, but not to ask for it. 100 to 1.**
And likewise - it's still easier to be there for someone than to be the one who is in need and to request it
You have a friend who is in need? They don't want to hear who you're on the same foot. Respect their individuality, their selfishness.
I'm here for you
We don't build trust with others by offering help to others, we build trust with others by asking for it
You're vulnerable - You need help
It takes way more courage to ask someone how can I help you rather than say how can I help
Not just that you're here for you, but that you understand
 
Be a leader
It's not about what you want
It's about what they want
Homeless signs, generic vs. new. $30 a day on a good day vs $40 in 2 hours
"If you only give once a month, please consider me next time"
It's not about the receiver, it's about the giver
Resolves common complaints: Why should I give, how are they trustworthy?
 
Add the word "yet"
 
In the darkest of days in which all is gloomy.
 
Own up to it; it will improve trust that you accept fault
 
I didn't sign up to run for president because I knew I was going to win. I didn't do it because I wanted to win. I did it because I wanted to try. That distinction is imperative
 
We must also make this distinction, do not be humble because you are afraid of the pressures and responsibility of praise. Be humble because you are more than ready for it.
 
Tetris, not Chess. There's strategy, but sometimes you just gotta do it
I thought it would be more competitive, I dare say it is less. Your motivation to be better is challenged greater than your desire to be better than others.
 
I'm not here to tell you can do it. Frankly, I can't. But I can tell you that there is no downside to trying, and that should the potential gains outweigh potential losses, then by all means seize the opportunity.
 
I always thought that worrying about things you didn't want to happen would stop them from happening… sometimes it works sometimes not… but really it is being prepared for them that stops them.

Counter Fundamental Attribution Error - be quick to be sympathetic and try to figure out situation rather than character
I sought support and nobody said much, but it was because tests were on their minds
On the other hand, don't underestimate the gravity of the situation if people are ever in need
 
**Humans do not crave perfection; rather, they crave improvement, more than anything**
 
***\#*Write** You can be wrong for not being nice enough, but you can't be wrong for being too nice
 
Thank you all for coming, I really love this assembly as a place for us to all hang out. I have been dreaming of this moment for a long time. We have unity, so let's talk about something else - faith. Faith in others and yourself is necessary. If you don't believe something can happen, there is absolutely no reason why it should happen. If you say you can't win, then don't expect to win. People say "I'm going to lose" before they play - is an excuse.
The biggest lesson I learned - Be the nice guy (different way)
No You or I - We
You gotta believe in others to succeed if you want them to
Own up to it.
Sometimes you gotta take the hit to make things happen
It's so unfair and you don't want to stoop to their level
Idea: stoop down to their level because nothing commands more respect or greatness
I believe in you so much I consider you an equal
 
However, for some people, a jump start is all they need to start their own cycle. It starts with what they own—their actions, their feelings, their thoughts, and it grows from there
 
Your characteristics have no limits on what the mind and imagination are capable of bringing, but your mind and imagination have all the limits over your character.
 
Man who works hard = good worker.
Man who has good ideas = dreamer.
Man who has both = dangerous.
That's all it takes.
If you think otherwise, if you would benefit from being born to a different family, different income, different skin color, no worries.
Merely a bump in the road - or a problem to fix.
Think about it - if you're poor, you're trying to get out and if you're rich you're trying to stay there. Where is there time to dream?
 
Try to understand others
Include impact in commands
 
Stop Insulting
It doesn't change opinions
"I didn't vote for the idiot"
More dogmatic, more strong than ever

***\#*Write** Your opinion doesn't matter as much as your willingness to defend it, or change it, or listen to others
 
You can go around and say high to 200 people. When you say hi to the last person, that will be your 200th hello.
 
But it may be his or her first.
 
**“To the world you may be one person; but to one person you may be the world.”**
― [Dr. Seuss](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/61105.Dr_Seuss)
 
Everyone wants to change the world. Nobody wants to change themselves.
 
To the victims, those were just one of thousands that firefighters have saved. But to them, they were the heroes of their lives.
 
If your teacher is grouchy, you don't know the full story. Meetings before, divorce
 
And that, my friends, is the side we don't see. I'm sure teachers and faculty would truly appreciate if we kept true to ourselves and understood others. Maybe for your teacher, your essay is the 200th out of too many to count.
 
Yet for faculty this could be the 10th, the 20th, or the 50th.
 
And I can't imagine what was going through the heads of first responders on that fateful day. It was an emergency out of thousands to them, but for many in that moment their first. And nobody gains an appreciation more for what they do than them. So you too.
 
We underappreciate the day, normal ones are the ones out of millions yet the ones you miss the most when things get hairy.
 
Look to your neighbor. You may not know a tenth of what he or she has gone through. You may never know what he or she goes through on a daily notice. You don't have to in order to make him or her feel special, but in their universe you may be the only thing special about today. So how about a hello, and a I'm here for you.
 
9/11 wasn't special just because people did their job. It's because they were here for each other
 
I believe in all of you… but it doesn't mean anything if you don't in yourself
 
Life doesn't get harder, it gets better. Better problems, from bare minimum to best.
 
That's the dif.
 
A education does not guarantee learning  
![882528f201764455b288ae2c7dd0057e](../../_resources/882528f201764455b288ae2c7dd0057e.gif)
All or nothing, you either get the job or you don't. You get the a or you don't. There's nothing in between
 
Don't ever aim to play close games if you can
 
9/11 - How many sacrifices does it take for us to truly appreciate the services of others?
Underappreciate the ordinary day.
 
A Leader is always ready to step forward when nobody else wants to and step back once someone does  
 
Do 5 minutes of writing. Why? Because it's infinitely better than doing 0 minutes of writing.
 
A point to stop consuming and start producing Freshman to Junior
 
It's a positive feedback loop. I was lucky to reach it early. It became a part of my identity and a kept it up

People could care less about your failures. I have cried so many tears, yet if you have seen me cried you are incredibly lucky. I was blessed to have parents who every time in my greatest time of need, would just be there for me.
 
I can't guarantee you I will not make mistakes. I will make mistakes. I will learn from them though. I hope  we all do the same  ***\#*Future** 
 
**The biggest risk is not taking one**
 
So be present.

If I were to change a current social issue today, I would choose to help people learn the degree of influence they have over their own lives—their locus of control.
Realizing my potential catapulted me to do things I could never imagine. Success is a continuous cycle of positive reinforcement, inspiring me to up the ante of commitment every turn, and to fear failure less, to find inevitably more success. However, for some people, a jump start is all they need to start their own cycle. It starts with what they own—their actions, their feelings, their thoughts, and it grows from there.
It isn't to detract from the fact that they lead challenging lives, but it pains me to hear people list failure and "inherent" characteristics as an excuse for a paucity of ambition. My brother is currently in the period of finding his own capabilities, but convinced himself that "he doesn't care". I hope that someday, he can break out of this mindset, and that success will inspire him to pursue his own dreams like never before. Your characteristics have no limits on what the mind and imagination are capable of bringing, but your mind and imagination have all the limits over your character.
 
 
I find that people who have inspired us the most have been the ones who failed, not the ones who succeeded. Success earns respect, failure earns trust
 
Thank the janitors. Thank the thankless jobs. Because most people have thankless jobs. Think of the servicemen.

2% expectation theory
 
Talking to krikorian and Sylvia. The biggest risk is not taking one
 
People often ask me why I am so cheerful or optimistic. The answer is simple. It's very hard to make history if you don't believe in the future
Talk about how stress and unhappiness literally inhibits brain activity / cognitive function
 
What has been done before, can be done again. Why do you think we remember the first, but not the second? Following pushed boundaries is natural of human condition. Likewise, it is important to leverage this to our advantage. Read about other people's stories.
Two types of inspiration, quotes, or stories that show the impossible
The world is led by optimists not because they lie, but because they create realities
 
Quality of your problems, and questions you ask yourself. val. How do I get an A? How do I get a C? I can tell. I don't smoke. I can't smoke. How internalized? I was lucky to be raised where whenever I worked hard, I got what I wanted.
 
Chances are that after today, we only see each other's successes. Heck, that's probably what has been happening. But take a chance if there is nothing to lose.
 
You frames - I want to help you but am having a hard time (my best advice about confrontations). This is not about you. This is about them.
 
Biggest takeaway, know the game you're playing. You exist to help others, using the you framework. And most importantly, the biggest risk is not taking one.
 
We have a tendency to make people extraordinary as an excuse not
 
Tell people what you've done, get labelled as a show off. But tell people what you want to achieve, get labelled an idealist. A hopeless romantic. A visionary. The story of the Olympian who announced to the village that he wanted to become a gold medalist. Everyone laughed. But guess what? The best mentors came. Don't try to be successful. Know what you want. Most people don't even get that part right.
 
Don't chase success. Chase problems.
 
80% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. For those 80% who live paycheck to paycheck, the biggest problem is how to get food on the table. How to get drinkable water. This isn't some Maslow's hierarchy of needs. If your biggest problem right now is how to get by with the minimum, then that is all that you will get. You will never achieve more than your greatest ambition.
 
2020, vision. It's time to change the lens.
 
Certainty if I told you your success rate is 20 percent, how many times would you try until you give up?
