# I May Not Be in Control of What Happens Around and Toward Me, but I Am Always in Control of How I See It, How I Respond, and How I React. At the End of the Day, That is All I Am Responsible for
â€œI can change my experience just by deciding to see things differently. I may not be in control of what happens around and toward me, but I am always in control of how I see it, how I respond, and how I react. At the end of the day, that is all I am responsible for"
