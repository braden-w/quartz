# English 011 Lincoln in Thought and Action
- Retrogression
- [August 31st, 2020](Daily Document/August 31st, 2020.md)

		- But a government in which the majority rule in all cases can not be based on justice, even as far as men understand it.
		- If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of government, let it go, let it go: perchance it will wear smooth,—certainly the machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself, then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be a counter friction to stop the machine. What I have to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to the wrong which I condemn.

		- topic―a strong condemnation of slavery
		- what he did―published and made speeches against slavery
			- In Park-street Church, on the Fourth of July, 1829, in an address on slavery, I unreflectingly assented to the popluar but pernicious doctrine of gradual abolition. I seize this opportunity to make a full and unequivocal recantation, and thus publicly to ask pardon of my God, of my country, and of my brethren the poor slaves, for having uttered a sentiment so full of timidity, injustice and absurdity. A similar recantation, from my pen, was published in the Genius of Universal Emancipation at Baltimore, in September, 1829. My consicence in now satisfied.
		- why severe language―you do not do things half-heartedly
			- I am aware, that many object to the severity of my language; but is there not cause for severity? I __will__ be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this subject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write, with moderation. No! no! Tell a man whose house is on fire, to give a moderate alarm; tell him to moderately rescue his wife from the hand of the ravisher; tell the mother to gradually extricate her babe from the fire into which it has fallen; -- but urge me not to use moderation in a cause like the present. I am in earnest -- I will not equivocate -- I will not excuse -- I will not retreat a single inch -- AND I WILL BE HEARD. The apathy of the people is enough to make every statue leap from its pedestal, and to hasten the resurrection of the dead.
		- Lincoln realizes that the United States is different because it has {{ no native people }}
		- the mob has a tendency to positive feedback loop destabilization, you either become with the mob or fragmented from the government
		- Proposition―an indicative statement that is falsifiable
			- Lincoln says that the nation was founded on the proposition of {{ all men are created equal }}
		- he is calling for cancelling passion
		- to change the system, play by the system
			- bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as possible, still while they continue in force, for the sake of example, they should be religiously observed

	- [Lyceum Address](http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/lyceum.htm)
		- As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.
		- describes as―ordinary people
			- a set of men, certainly not following for a livelihood, a very useful, or very honest occupation; but one which, so far from being forbidden by the laws, was actually licensed by an act of the Legislature, passed but a single year before. Next, negroes, suspected of conspiring to raise an insurrection, were caught up and hanged in all parts of the State: then, white men, supposed to be leagued with the negroes; and finally, strangers, from neighboring States, going thither on business, were, in many instances subjected to the same fate. Thus went on this process of hanging, from gamblers to negroes, from negroes to white citizens, and from these to strangers; till, dead men were seen literally dangling from the boughs of trees upon every road side; and in numbers almost sufficient, to rival the native Spanish moss of the country, as a drapery of the forest
		- a group of lawless in spirit―by such examples, by instances of the perpetrators of such acts going unpunished, **the lawless in spirit, are encouraged to become lawless in practice**; and having been used to no restraint, but dread of punishment, they thus become, absolutely unrestrained.
		- notably, Abraham lincoln discounts the situation through―completing the audience's thoughts
			- You are, perhaps, ready to ask, "What has this to do with the perpetuation of our political institutions?" I answer, it has much to do with it
			- But, it may be asked, why suppose danger to our political institutions? Have we not preserved them for more than fifty years? And why may we not for fifty times as long?
			- The hanging of the gamblers was of little consequence
			- The African Americans, had they not met their fate at the mob, would have met a similar fate at the hands of the law
		- the reason that either side can fall into anarchy―the desire of distinction, whether through enslavement or abolition
		- the introduction of religion/higher being―let us have an attachment and respect to the law, let us lay down as a political religion, specifically in a democracy
			- why this is specifically important in democracy―the mechanism through which democracy garners power is shared through that that powers mobs
			- **the law is not majority preference**
		- warns of―a slippery slope
			- swear by the blood of the Revolution, never to violate in the least particular, the laws of the country; and never to tolerate their violation by others
			- uphold the social contract

		- The "spot" resolutions were to ask Polk where the "spot" of Mexican aggression was
		- What, in the name of all that is sacred, was the President to do but exactly what he did do – move our army to the extreme limit of our boundary, and there await the onslaught, if Mexico chose to make it?
		- Well, where does the shoe pinch here, gentlemen? Are you horrified at the success of the American arms? I verily believe that many of you would have been better pleased if the results of this war had been the defeat of our armies and a loss of American territory, and more especially if it had secured the defeat of the dominant party.
		- Here we are in the second week of this short session, denouncing the President for causing an unholy, impious, and vindictive war, and cavilling and carping at the manner in which he has protected the Mexican people who have yielded to the resistless shock of our victorious arms.

	- [Henry Clay](http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/clay.htm)
		- Of antithesis, and elegant arrangement of words and sentences; but rather of that deeply earnest and impassioned tone, and manner
		- Deep devotion to the cause of human liberty
		- Missouri compromise
			- Mr. Clay was in congress, and, perceiving the danger, at once engaged his whole energies to avert it. It began, as I have said, in 1819; and it did not terminate till 1821. Missouri would not yield the point; and congress -- that is, a majority in congress -- by repeated votes, showed a determination to not admit the state unless it should yield. After several failures, and great labor on the part of Mr. Clay to so present the question that a majority could consent to the admission, it was, by a vote, rejected, and as all seemed to think, finally. A sullen gloom hung over the nation. All felt that the rejection of Missouri, was equivalent to a dissolution of the Union, because those states which already had, what Missouri was rejected for refusing to relinquish, would go with Missouri. All deprecated and deplored this, but none saw how to avert it. For the judgment of Members to be convinced of the necessity of yielding, was not the whole difficulty; each had a constituency to meet, and to answer to. Mr. Clay, though worn down, and exhausted, was appealed to by members, to renew his efforts at compromise. He did so, and by some judicious modifications of his plan, coupled with laborious efforts with individual members, and his own over-mastering eloquence upon the floor, he finally secured the admission of the State. Brightly, and captivating as it had previously shown, it was now perceived that his great eloquence, was a mere embellishment, or, at most, but a helping hand to his inventive genius, and his devotion to his country in the day of her extreme peril.
		- Divine Providence, ending is very religious
	- [Speech on the Kansas Nebraska Act](http://vlib.us/amdocs/texts/kansas.html) [ Peoria Speech, October 16, 1854 - Lincoln Home National Historic Site (U.S. National Park Service)](https://www.nps.gov/liho/learn/historyculture/peoriaspeech.htm)
		- response to―Douglas
		- significance―his most ambitious speech before presidency
		- self-interest (how Lincoln uses it)―selfishness
		- Near eighty years ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal; but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration, that for some men to enslave others is a ‘sacred right of self-government.’ These principles can not stand together. They are as opposite as God and mammon; and whoever holds to the one, must despise the other.”
		- I trust I understand, and truly estimate the right of self-government. My faith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own,lies at the foundation of the sense of justice there is in me. I extend the principles to communities of men, as well as to individuals. I so extend it, because it is politically wise, as well as naturally just: politically wise, in saving us from broils about matters which do not concern us. Here, or at Washington, I would not trouble myself with the oyster laws of Virginia, or the cranberry laws of Indiana.
		- The doctrine of self government is right--absolutely and eternally right--but it has no just application, as here attempted. Or perhaps I should rather say that whether it has such just application depends upon whether a Negro is __not__ or is a man. If he is __not__ a man, why in that case, he who is a man may, as a matter of self-government, do just as he pleases with him. But if the Negro is a man, is it not to that extent, a total destruction of self-government, to say that he too shall not govern __himself__ ? When the white man governs himself, and also governs __another__ man, that is __more __ than self-government--that is despotism. If the Negro is a __man__ , why then my ancient faith teaches me that “all men are created equal;” and that there can be no moral right in connection with one man's making a slave of another
		- Judge Douglas frequently, with bitter irony and sarcasm,paraphrases our argument by saying “The white people of Nebraska are good enough to govern themselves, __but they are not good enough to govern a few miserable Negroes__ !!”
		- Well I doubt not that the people of Nebraska are, and will continue to be as good as the average of people elsewhere. I do not say the contrary. What I do say is, that no man is good enough to govern another man, __without the other's consent__ .I say this is the leading principle--the sheet anchor of American republicanism. Our Declaration of Independence says:
		- “We hold these truths to be self evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights,governments are instituted among men, DERIVING THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED.”
		- "Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment, is not the sole question"
			- Justice is justice, sound judgement is more utilitarian on the preservation of the Republican
		- He asks that they keep 1 for 1 or concessions so―they stay on the table, tactical decision. You're giving us nothing?
		- `I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself.`
	- [Letter to Speed](http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/speed.htm)
		- why roused?―Of the one hundred members composing the two branches of that body, about seventy were democrats. These latter held a caucus, in which the Nebraska bill was talked of, if not formally discussed. It was thereby discovered that just three, and no more, were in favor of the measure. In a day of two Dougla's [sic] orders came on to have resolutions passed approving the bill; and they were passed by large majorities!!! The truth of this is vouched for by a bolting democratic member. The masses too, democratic as well as whig, were even, nearer unanimous [sic] against it; but as soon as the party necessity of supporting it, became apparent, the way the democracy began to see the  __wisdom__  and  __justice__  of it, was perfectly astonishing.
		- Difference between in practice and principle
			- principle―all men are created equal
			- practice―against extension of slavery
	- [ Lincoln Speech Text - Kalamazoo Valley Museum ](https://kalamazoomuseum.org/localhistory/lincoln/speech.html)
		- Can Nebraska, as a free state, somehow vote slavery in?
			- 9 out of 10 people are free, 1 out of 10 is a slave holder. The mere
			- Once slavery is in with a lot of free people, it will be planted and can become legitimate
			- Therefore, stopping the extension of slavery is the politically prudent option, as people won't opt for slavery if they're not used to it
				- Notably, this is not the moral option. The moral option is to end slavery, period
			- prudent vs moral option―prudent is in practice, moral is on principle

	- [ Speech at Springfield, June 26, 1857 - mrlincolnandfreedom.org](http://www.mrlincolnandfreedom.org/pre-civil-war/dred-scott/speech-at-springfield-june-26-1857/)
		- Utah's Self-Government
			- I begin with Utah. If it prove to be true, as is probable, that the people of Utah are in open rebellion in the United States, then Judge Douglas is in favor of repealing their territorial organization, and attaching them to the adjoining States for judicial purposes. I say, too, if they are in rebellion, they ought to be somehow coerced to obedience; and I am not now prepared to admit or deny that the Judge’s mode of coercing them is not as good as any. The Republicans can fall in with it without taking back anything they have ever said. To be sure, it would be a considerable backing down by Judge Douglas from his much vaunted doctrine of self-government for the territories; but this is only additional proof of what was very plain from the beginning, that that doctrine was a mere deceitful pretense for the benefit of slavery. Those who could not see that much in the Nebraska act itself, which forced Governors, and Secretaries, and Judges on the people of the territories, without their choice or consent, could not be made to see, though one should rise from the dead to testify.
			- Criticizes democrats for **hypocrisy** in considering self-government for slavery but not for polygamy (double standard)
				- You have predetermined beliefs of what is right or wrong for polygamy, but no stance on slavery?
		- Criticizes judge douglas on allowing vote
		- Now I protest against that counterfeit logic which concludes that, because I do not want a black woman for a __slave__ I must necessarily want her for a __wife__ . I need not have her for either, I can just leave her alone.** ****`In some respects she certainly is not my equal; but in her natural right to eat the bread she earns with her own hands without asking leave of any one else, she is my equal, and the equal of all others.`**` `
		- Hedging himself from strawman argumantsWanting a black woman not as a slave but as a neighbor does not mean as a wife. Stating that we are equal does not mean we are all the same in all respects. Also note that we are not equal does not imply inferiority or superiority
	- [ "House Divided" Speech by Abraham Lincoln](http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/house.htm)  (1858)
		- Prophetic tone, either we will end slavery or be ended. Considered to be quite controversial
			- Either the __opponents__ of slavery, will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or its __advocates__ will push it forward, till it shall become alike lawful in __all__ the States, __old__ as well as __new__ -- __North__ as well as __South__ .
			- Then opened the roar of loose declamation in favor of "Squatter Sovereignty," and "Sacred right of self-government."
		- "But," said opposition members, "let us be more __specific__ -- let us __amend__ the bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the territory may exclude slavery." "Not we," said the friends of the measure; and down they voted the amendment.
		- Response to―**Nebraska doctrine, and the Dred Scott decision**
		- The three bad things argued in Dred Scott ↓
			- Preventing slaves from being citizens
			- Neither congress or legislature is allowed to exclude slavery
				- Roger Tawney argues that states do not have the authority to regulate rights to property
			- Hunting slaves in northern states
				- Excluding slave owners from bringing in their slaves is "unconstitutional"
				- Lincoln fears this will habituate others to the presence of slaves, as demonstrated in his [ Lincoln Speech Text - Kalamazoo Valley Museum ](Braden Wong/Notes/Yale Courses/First Semester/English 011: Lincoln in Thought and Action/September 7th, 2020/ Lincoln Speech Text - Kalamazoo Valley Museum .md)
				- Habituation―Exposing bad things to others will normalize them
		- Dred Scott decision has rendered Douglas' policy impossible to implement
		- The Problem with Popular Sovereignty―impossible to implement
		- Three possible stances that Lincoln can take that are not radically abolitionist ↓
			- No expansions of slavery
			- Squatter sovereignty―whoever comes first can vote in a slave constitution
		- What Dredd Scott accomplishes is that―you can't ban slavery ANYWHERE
		- The conspiracy paragraph ↓
			- Summary: They acted as not "pro-slavery", but worked in the background to ensure that this was the case
			- ** 	 Why was the amendment, expressly declaring the right of the people to exclude slavery, voted down? Plainly enough ** __**now**__ **, the adoption of it would have spoiled the niche for the Dred Scott decision.**
			- ** 	 Why was the amendment, expressly declaring the right of the people to exclude slavery, voted down? Plainly enough ** __**now**__ **, the adoption of it would have spoiled the niche for the Dred Scott decision.**
			- ** 	 Why was the court decision held up? Why even a Senator's individual opinion withheld, till ** __**after**__ ** the presidential election? Plainly enough ** __**now**__ **, the speaking out ** __**then**__ ** would have damaged the ** __**"perfectly free"**__ ** argument upon which the election was to be carried.**
			- ** 	 Why the ** __**outgoing**__ ** President's felicitation on the indorsement? Why the delay of a reargument? Why the incoming President's ** __**advance**__ ** exhortation in favor of the decision?**
			- ** 	 These things ** __**look**__ ** like the cautious ** __**patting**__ ** and ** __**petting**__ ** of a spirited horse, preparatory to mounting him, when it is dreaded that he may give the rider a fall.**
			- ** 	 And why the hasty after indorsements of the decision by the President and others?**
			- ** 	 We can not absolutely ** __**know**__ ** that all these exact adaptations are the result of preconcert. But when we see a lot of framed timbers, different portions of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places and by different workmen -- Stephen, Franklin, Roger, and James, for instance -- and when we see these timbers joined together, and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill, all the tenons and mortices exactly fitting, and all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their respective places, and not a piece too many or too few -- not omitting even scaffolding -- or, if a single piece be lacking, we can see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared to yet bring such piece in -- in ** __**such**__ ** a case, we find it impossible not to believe that Stephen and Franklin and Roger and James all understood one another from the beginning, and all worked upon a common ** __**plan**__ ** or ** __**draft**__ ** drawn up before the first lick was struck.**
	- Rather than to reunify, he hopes to reclaim what is lost
	- Lacompton Constitution
		- Force a fake constitution upon the people through a fraudulent vote
		- Douglas takes a stance against this (to set him in favor of both north and south), and wishes to see it legitimately and "doesn't care if it is voted up or down" due to his stance on popular sovereignty
			-
			- Lincoln traps this and takes it down
		- Another highly noticeable difference between the views of Douglas and Lincoln was based on the fact that black Americans also had legal rights. According to Douglas, he believed that, in all aspects of life, the black people would always be inferior to the white people and highly opposed the issue of citizenship for the black people. According to Lincoln, he believed that the black people were meant to be treated as equals to the white people including Douglas himself. In retaliation to remarks that Lincoln had said, Douglas replied saying “Mr. Lincoln asserts, as a fundamental principle of this government, that there must be uniformity in the local laws and domestic institutions of each and all the States of the Union; and he therefore, invites all the non-slaveholding States to band together, organize as one body, and make war upon slavery in the states that still practiced slavery” (Richard, 1965). __ __

	- [ First Debate: Ottawa, Illinois - Lincoln Home National Historic Site (U.S. National Park Service)](https://www.nps.gov/liho/learn/historyculture/debate1.htm)
		- Introduction
			- Turns tables on the conspiracy theory, Lincoln is a conspirator
			- Lincoln abolitionizes the Whig Party
		- The agreement between Lincoln, Whigs, Abolitionists, etc.
		- Lincoln argues that the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was the fire that started the fracture
		- "I think, and shall try to show, that it is wrong; wrong in its direct effect, letting slavery into Kansas and Nebraska-and wrong in its prospective principle, allowing it to spread to every other part of the wide world, where men can be found inclined to take it.
			- "This __declared__ indifference, but, as I must think, covert real zeal for the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world-enables the enemies of free institutions, with plausibility, to taunt us as hypocrites-causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity, and especially because it forces so many really good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty-criticizing the Declaration of Independence, and insisting that there is no right principle of action but __self-interest__ .
			- "Before proceeding, let me say I think I have no prejudice against the Southern people. They are just what we would be in their situation. If slavery did not now exist among them, they would not introduce it. If it did now exist amongst us, we should not instantly give it up. This I believe of the masses North and South. Doubtless there are individuals on both sides, who would not hold slaves under any circumstances; and others who would gladly introduce slavery anew, if it were out of existence. We know that some Southern men do free their slaves, go North, and become tiptop Abolitionists; while some Northern ones go South, and become most cruel slave-masters.
	- "Maintenance of integrity"
		- Implies that we are losing integrity
		- We are intrinsically good
		- Loss aversion, the reverence of Lincoln to the birth of the nation
		- We were born to such a high standard and are having a retrogression
	- Now, gentlemen, I don't want to read at any greater length, but this is the true complexion of all I have ever said in regard to the institution of slavery and the black race. This is the whole of it, and anything that argues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the negro, is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of words, by which a man can prove a horse-chestnut to be a chestnut horse. [Laughter.] I will say here, while upon this subject, that I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so. I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races. There is a physical difference between the two, which, in my judgment, will probably forever forbid their living together upon the footing of perfect equality, and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position. I have never said anything to the contrary, but I hold that, notwithstanding all this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. [Loud cheers.] I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man. I agree with Judge Douglas he is not my equal in many respects-certainly not in color, perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment. But in the right to eat the bread, without the leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, __he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man.__ [Great applause.]
- Writing Tips
	- Remove perhaps, arguably, any other qualifiers unless you really need them
		- If you want to argue, argue it. Don't say "arguably" as if someone else is arguing it
- [September 30th, 2020](Daily Document/September 30th, 2020.md) [ Song of Myself (1892 version) by Walt Whitman | Poetry Foundation](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45477/song-of-myself-1892-version)
	- In the sixth section of the poem, the poet transitions to a story about a child holding a handful of leaves and asking, “What is the grass?” Though the poet knows this is an impossible question, he continues to muse on it, thinking that the grass may be the leaves, the child, of God. He goes on to catalog all the things he sees in the world: the people, animals, and natural features. He declares that he loves them all just as they are and loves the way they fit together. The poet sees them all as part of God’s works, just as the grass is a simple thing that is still divine because God made it.
	- Section 15―The poet observes or "takes in" his surroundings. One can observe the sounds of the singer, conductor beating time, the plane whistling, the drove singing. There is an example of a prostitute that lasts for three lines, which the author regards the booing crowd with disdain
		- The final three lines of this section work to pull the chaos of this vast catalog of sensory impressions into a kind of unity, and that unity is the self that has perceived them. Any single “I” has one vantage point, one set of eyes and ears that is continually absorbing the welter of sense impressions around the “I.” From that vantage point, it feels as if the world is “tending inward to me,” inclining, moving, stretching in toward the self’s eyes and ears and nose and tongue. At the same time, the “I” feels something in the self that is extending out toward the world, toward that endless stream of sights and sounds and smells. “I tend outward to them”: our senses reach out to the things of the world, always; our eyes are hungry to see, and our ears are hungry to hear. But so many things pass in front of our eyes and ears that we miss or ignore or are oblivious to, so we need also to “attend” to them, to take care to register and record them (as Whitman has done in this section with such loving care). So it is always what Whitman calls an “influx” and an “efflux,” the world incessantly whirling toward our senses, and our senses reaching out to absorb that world. And that, more or less, is what we are: we are the things we have seen, heard, touched, tasted, smelled: “such as it is to be of these more or less I am.” No idea we have, no word we use, no love we feel, did not originate “out there.” They all entered in through our open senses, our senses which extended out to embrace them and then tended to them as we absorbed them: and out of all those endless stimuli, we each weave the unique song of our self.
	- Section 28―
		- This section contains the famous "crisis" in which Whitman seems to be under attack from himself. Some critics think this section is about masturbation.
		- At any rate, he feels that the power of "touch" has gotten way out of hand (no pun intended).
		- This passage is filled with sexually suggestive phrases like "treacherous tip of me," "stiffening my limbs," "red marauder," and "I went myself first to the headland . . . my own hands carried me there."
		- He feels suffocated by his sense of touch, which overpowers him and creates an enormous release of energy.
		- Let's face it: it's hard not to read the end of this section as a veiled reference to orgasm and ejaculation.
	- Section 38
		- He's tired of moping around and being in the dumps. Too many thoughts about amputation and imprisonment threaten to rob him of his optimism.
		- He has been stunned, but now he snaps out of it and regains his bold, aggressive posture, telling us to "stand back!"
		- He has almost committed some "usual mistake," which seems to have something to do with complaining and dwelling on his own problems.
		- He almost forgot about everyone else's problems, the people who are mocked and crucified beside him. He can't treat his own sufferings any differently.
		- He compares himself to Jesus Christ rising from his tomb after crucifixion.
		- And we're back in business. The old, confident Walt is back, and he continues his journey through the United States, this time on foot.
		- He salutes the students ("eleves") of the world, but says he is both in front of and behind them. (The word, élève is French for "student.")
	- Section 49 - He uses "you" to personify Life and Death
		- context―in the 1850s, you had the domestication of death where graveyards were made elaborate and beautiful. He uses the word "manure" to interesting effect
	- Section 48-52
		- The speaker now sums up what he has been saying all along: the body and the soul are equals, and the self is most important of all, even more important than God.
		- He is no longer fearful of death

		- He (the Young American) owns a large part of the world, by right of possessing it; and all the rest by right of  __ wanting it, and intending to have it…Young America had “a pleasing hope — a fond desire — a longing after” territory. He has a great passion—a perfect rage—for the “new”; particularly new men for office, and the new earth mentioned in the revelations, in which, being no more sea, there must be about three times as much land as in the present. He is a great friend of humanity; and his desire for land is not selfish, but merely an impulse to extend the area of freedom. He is very anxious to fight for the liberation of enslaved nations and colonies, provided, always, they have land…As to those who have no land, and would be glad of help from any quarter, he considers they can afford to wait a few hundred years longer. In knowledge he is particularly rich. He knows all that can possibly be known; inclines to believe in spiritual trappings, and is the unquestioned inventor of “Manifest Destiny.” ____

	- Cooper Union Speech
		- The carefully crafted speech examined the views of the 39 signers of the Constitution. Lincoln noted that at least 21 of them -- a majority -- believed Congress should control slavery in the territories, rather than allow it to expand. Thus, the Republican stance of the time was not revolutionary, but similar to the Founding Fathers, and should not alarm Southerners, for radicals had threatened to secede if a Republican was elected President. [ Abraham Lincoln's Cooper Union Address](http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/cooper.htm)

		- They say we are sectional because we do not exist in their section. But, without change of principle, should we gain votes in your sectional, we shall cease to be sectional? (120)
		- Do you really feel yourselves justified to divide up this government? (130)
		- John brown: There is an inevitability of violence, but stick with us and it might be okay (more radical than house divided but also interestingly pacifist)
		- Lincoln could say "should we", but "can we" implies a physicality to morality. We cannot do something, as if the predefinition of nature stops us from this. We cannot yield (129)

		- Defense of slavery
		- Discusses alternative constitution
		- Discusses that the South will be okay in the case of seccession
		- Our system commits no such violation of nature's laws. With us, all of the white race, however high or low, rich or poor, are equal in the eye of the law. Not so with the negro. Subordination is his place. He, by nature, or by the curse against Canaan, is fitted for that condition which he occupies in our system.
		- We have all the essential elements of a high national career. The idea has been given out at the North, and even in the border States, that we are too small and too weak to maintain a separate nationality. This is a great mistake. In extent of territory we embrace five hundred and sixty-four thousand square miles and upward. This is upward of two hundred thousand square miles more than was included within the limits of the original thirteen States. It is an area of country more than double the territory of France or the Austrian empire. France, in round numbers, has but two hundred and twelve thousand square miles. Austria, in round numbers, has two hundred and forty-eight thousand square miles. Ours is greater than both combined. It is greater than all France, Spain, Portugal, and Great Britain, including England, Ireland, and Scotland, together. In population we have upward of five millions, according to the census of 1860; this includes white and black. The entire population, including white and black, of the original thirteen States, was less than four millions in 1790, and still less in 76, when the independence of our fathers was achieved. If they, with a less population, dared maintain their independence against the greatest power on earth, shall we have any apprehension of maintaining ours now?
		- In this connection I take this occasion to state, that I was not without grave and serious apprehensions, that if the worst came to the worst, and cutting loose from the old government should be the only remedy for our safety and security, it would be attended with much more serious ills than it has been as yet. Thus far we have seen none of those incidents which usually attend revolutions. No such material as such convulsions usually throw up has been seen. Wisdom, prudence, and patriotism, have marked every step of our progress thus far. This augurs well for the future, and it is a matter of sincere gratification to me, that I am enabled to make the declaration. Of the men I met in the Congress at Montgomery, I may be pardoned for saying this, an abler, wiser, a more conservative, deliberate, determined, resolute, and patriotic body of men, I never met in my life. Their works speak for them; the provisional government speaks for them; the constitution of the permanent government will be a lasting monument of their worth, merit, and statesmanship.
		- Why cannot the whole question be settled, if the north desire peace, simply by the Congress, in both branches, with the concurrence of the President, giving their consent to the separation, and a recognition of our independence?

		- Most nations don't have language for secession
			- The Duke of Argyll, one of the few British statesmen of the time who followed this struggle with intelligent interest, briefly summed up the question thus: "I know of no government in the world that could possibly have admitted the right of secession from its own allegiance." Oddly enough, President Buchanan, in his Message to Congress on December 4, put the same point not less forcibly.

		- Discusses Navy and pirates

		- "Labor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration. Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always will be, a relation between labor and capital producing mutual benefits. The error is in assuming that the whole labor of community exists within that relation. A few men own capital, and that few avoid labor themselves, and with their capital hire or buy another few to labor for them. A large majority belong to neither class--neither work for others nor have others working for them. In most of the Southern States a majority of the whole people of all colors are neither slaves nor masters, while in the Northern a large majority are neither hirers nor hired. Men, with their families--wives, sons, and daughters--work for themselves on their farms, in their houses, and in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and asking no favors of capital on the one hand nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other."
		- "Many independent men everywhere in these States a few years back in their lives were hired laborers. The prudent, penniless beginner in the world labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself, then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him. This is the just and generous and prosperous system which opens the way to all, gives hope to all, and consequent energy and progress and improvement of condition to all."
	- Bromwich Writing Tips
		- Use the word "refer" over "reference"
		- Advocate is a transitive verb―I "advocated" the destruction of a word. You don't need I "advocate" for.
		- No "themes" necessary. Speeches don't have themes, but themes are interpreted within speeches
		- He or she―They can be used on somebody, anybody, etc. You may project your own pronoun for singular. So "the worker… he" or "the author… she"

You cannot believe the consequentiality. He does so at huge disappointment to his listeners, but does not offend them. This suddenly has nothing to do with him being an abolitionist

			- There are those who are dissatisfied with me. To such I would say: You desire peace; and you blame me that we do not have it. But how can we attain it? There are but three conceivable ways. First, to suppress the rebellion by force of arms. This I am trying to do. Are you for it? If you are, so far we are agreed. If you are not for it, a second way is to give up the Union. I am against this. Are you for it? If you are, you should say so plainly. If you are not for force, nor yet for dissolution, there only remains some imaginable compromise. I do not believe any compromise, embracing the maintenance of the Union, is now possible. All I learn, leads to a directly opposite belief. The strength of the rebellion, is its military--its army. That army dominates all the country, and all the people, within its range. Any offer of terms made by any man or men within that range, in opposition to that army, is simply nothing for the present; because such man or men, have no power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise, if one were made with them. To illustrate. Suppose refugees from the South, and peace men of the North, get together in convention, and frame and proclaim a compromise embracing a restoration of the Union; in what way can that compromise be used to keep Lee's army out of Pennsylvania?

		- **“When, early in the war, Gen. Fremont attempted military emancipation, I forbade it, because I did not then think it an indispensable necessity. When a little later, Gen. Cameron, then Secretary of War, suggested the arming of the blacks, I objected, because I did not yet think it an indispensable necessity. When, still later, Gen. Hunter attempted military emancipation, I again forbade it, because I did not yet think the indispensable necessity had come. When, in March, and May, and July 1862 I made earnest, and successive appeals to the border states to favor compensated emancipation, I believed the indispensable necessity for military emancipation, and arming the blacks would come, unless averted by that measure. They declined the proposition; and I was, in my best judgment, driven to the alternative of either surrendering the Union, and with it, the Constitution, or of laying strong hand upon the colored element. I chose the latter. In choosing it, I hoped for greater gain than loss; but of this, I was not entirely confident. More than a year of trial now shows no loss by it in our foreign relations, none in our home popular sentiment, none in our white military force,---no loss by it any how or any ]where. On the contrary, it shows a gain of quite a hundred and thirty thousand soldiers, seamen, and laborers. These are palpable facts, about which, as facts, there can be no cavilling. We have the men; and we could not have had them without the measure.” (585)**
