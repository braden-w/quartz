# [[2021-11-25]] Going to [[19th Floor of the Omni]] with Kat Moon and Alicia (Kat's Friend)



Beautiful sunset (even though the time of day was afternoon). I am so grateful to have stumbled upon Kat and having her show me up (and this was because I used the bathroom).

On the way back, I met [[Jenny Mao]], [[Arushi Dogra]], [[Aprecita]], [[Sharon]], [[Phillip from Berkeley]], and [[Mihael (Friend of Phillip from Berkeley]] where we would go to [[2021-11-25 Visiting Yellow Gingko Tree in Timothy Dwight with Jenny Mao, Arushi Dogra, Aprecita, Sharon, Phillip From Berkeley, and Mihael (Friend of Phillip From Berkeley]].
