# [[2021-10-31]] Not the most fortunate turn of events



1. Fell out a bit with Bryce and no longer helping him with essays for nwo ^979114
2. Turns out [[Aaron from Google|Aaron Gove]] is no longer with Caroline
3. Got a 69% on my Cognitive Science Midterm which was surprising.

In the end, I know that it will all be for the better. I will make the most of the circumstances given to me.
