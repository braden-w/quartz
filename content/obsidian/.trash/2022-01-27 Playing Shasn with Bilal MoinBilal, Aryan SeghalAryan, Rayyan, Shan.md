# 2022-01-27 Playing Shasn with Bilal MoinBilal, Aryan SeghalAryan, Rayyan, Shan



Heated up a frozen [[Mac and Cheese]] with Sonny's microwave, joking that the herbs are actually mold

Reminded us of the same squad of [[2020-11-19 House of Naan with Bilal, Aryan, Rayyan, Shan]]

It was so fun! At the end, Bilal won. At one point, I executed a crazy Conspiracy card where I gained two free voters after overflowing + trading in the same move.

We were super lighthearted and kind to each other. We played non-aggressive and supported each other.
