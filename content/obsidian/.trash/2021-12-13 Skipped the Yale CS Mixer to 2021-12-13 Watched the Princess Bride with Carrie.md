# [[2021-12-13]] Skipped the Yale CS Mixer to [[2021-12-13 Watched the Princess Bride with Carrie]]

  

Skipped it in favor of [[2021-12-13 Watched the Princess Bride with Carrie]], and while so many people were there and it seemed like a great time, I was grateful I did! Anna Xu told us later about it that it was exactly what she expected, and that people even brought their backpacks!!
