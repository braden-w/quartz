# [[2021-11-14]] Call with Alan Le and Yvonne

Talked about how I met Carrie.

[[Alan Le|Alan]] talked about hearing his dad grieving and his brother and girlfriend making noises at the same time, which was a very strange 

[[Alan Le|Alan]] also talked about drama with his suitemate and president of a club, who was super power hungry and tried to out him. Fortunately, Alan was super likable and able to hold his ground and have people vouch for him.

Yvonne talked about creepy men trying to get with her suitemates and another Fboy who had been visiting their suite and their housemate didn't tell them until the fourth time. Yvonne was really demolishing them and making sure that they had no hope. [[If You're Going to Break His Heart, Break it into a Million Pieces]] We were so happy and [[Alan Le|Alan]] and I were cheering her on.
