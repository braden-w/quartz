# [[2021-11-29]] David's Birthday



## Dinner

During dinner, we told Diane that it was his birthday. Without hesitation, she pulled down her mask, waltzed over to our table, and then made the announcement. As we sang Happy Birthday, she raised David's hand so everyone knew it was him. It was so great!! Really enjoyed it.

## Cake Cutting

Gave him [[2021-11-29 Letter for David's Birthday]].

Invited a bunch of the boys: [[Deyuan Li]], [[Daniel Kim]], [[Andrew Milas]], [[Alexa Schorr]], [[Tory Lu]], [[Sonny]], [[Bilal]], [[Dante Motley]], and more! We were wearing matching sweaters which was super cute.

## Playing Board Game

Jerry and Beylina both claimed to be SEER, and chaos ensued. It was so fun!!

## Insomnia's Run

Was unable to get it for free but still had some delicious cookies with the boys.
