# [[2021-12-09]] Deep Conversation with [[Carrie]] About Concerns About Insecurities



[[2021-12-09 CASA Board Win for Carrie and Banquet! Eating Basil Restaurant]]

Had a deep comforting conversation with [[Carrie]] at Hopper about Mai and other perhaps irrational, but very valid concerns we had about the relationship. We had a slight communication flub where I had told [[Carrie]] a few months ago I don't talk to Mai, but I have recently and so it seemed like I was not being up front about things. Talked and got a bit emotional and cathartic.
