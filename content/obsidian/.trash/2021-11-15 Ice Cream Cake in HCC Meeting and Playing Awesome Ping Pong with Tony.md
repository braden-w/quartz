# [[2021-11-15]] Ice Cream Cake in HCC Meeting and Playing Awesome Ping Pong with Tony


Had a delicious Ice Cream Cake to celebrate [[Dante Motley]] and Liam's birthdays in HCC Meeting!!

It was absolutely delicious!! Afterwards, I played some intense ping pong with Tony. I slammed a ball so hard, that we lost it in the rafters of the [[Hopper Buttery]]!
