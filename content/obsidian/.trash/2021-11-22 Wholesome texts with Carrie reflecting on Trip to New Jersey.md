[[2021-11-21 Trip to New Jersey with Carrie]]

[[Carrie]]:
Thank you for updating me even though my phone was silenced Bc I asked you too 🥺🥺
I’m home now!! My mom made soup so I’m drinking that now hehe
Flight was pretty good, I was just sleeping 😴💀💀 since I’m borderline narcoleptic LMAO \* bc I asked you to
And not to beat a dead horse but 😫 thank you so much for coming to New Jersey to see me off and spend time with me, and for offering to take pictures and sharing those pictures with me, and for dealing with timing issues and the like, and for navigating for us all day !! Thank you for listening to me talk about art and ceramics, and for good conversation. Thank you for waking up early for me so we could catch the train in the first place, even though I know you’re so tired :( Thank you for being willing to take the train back by yourself even though it was so late. Thank you for always being willing to give your time and energy to me, and for telling me when you don’t feel supported and/or appreciated enough.
I hope you get some rest over the break, and finish the things you want to finish!! Also let me know the finance things for the trip ok? I’ll see you :)
Also! Thank you for having the foresight to get food from the dining hall for lunch :) we becoming our parents for real for real lol
I finished my paper 😭✌️

Braden Wong:
Oh my goodness [[Carrie]] 😖😭
I’m so glad you’re safe and finished your paper !!
Thank you for setting alarms so that I can wake up with you every morning, thank you for arranging our museum visit and taking the time to always plan things in advance, thank you for sitting with me during Harvard Yale and being patient with me even when I felt flustered by the Harvard kids 😭 thank you for treating me to Bulgogi and walking with me in New Jersey, thank you for letting me take pictures of you 😍, and thank you for listening to me and making me feel understood and appreciated ❤️ I hope that I can do the same for you 🤗 and please get to finish all the things you want to finish!! That’s so important and I’m rooting for you
The transport for train for me was \$139 and a little bit more for ubers but time with you is more than enough :) I just can’t wait to see you again
