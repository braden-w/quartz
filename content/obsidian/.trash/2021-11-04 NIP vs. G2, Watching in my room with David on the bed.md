# 2021-11-04 NIP vs. G2, Watching in my room with David on the bed
They played the flip game

## Inferno
NIP is in their home turf, and you would think this would be an advantage but nooo.

G2 started strong at 10-1, Niko had a triple kill back stab, went 19-3 against NIP.

Even though NIP was about to win a round, Nexa nails the 1 vs. 2 and keeps it up.

Right NIP won a round, G2 did a power play and ran up mid and killed 2.

This was straight up bullying and disrespect! Final half was 12-3
