# [[2021-11-01]] Demolished my PSYC 179 exam and eating lunch with Tony and Sungho at Morse



Absolutely demolished my PSYC 179 exam! Only one multiple choice question was missed, and I had plenty of time to write a bunch of words in my free responses. I hope that I did well! It seems like taking the tips from Professor Ahn, watching the past lectures, really paid off!! My preparation on anchoring bias, specifically with priming, was particularly on point.

Afterwards, I decided to walk to Morse and eat there since it was along the way. I saw Ian at the line, and then grabbed some mussels and a yam to sit down with Tony from Glee Club and Sungho. We talked about the [[2021-10-31 Communist manifesto, watching the YSO Halloween Show, free buttery food, hanging out with suitemates in common room and reading Librex]] and other aspects of YSO. I had no idea that it was completely student run!! That was absolutely crazy to me.

Afterwards, I grabbed some spinach cheese pizza which was SO delicious! Morse and Styles has the best pizza by far, and the spinach cheese is definitely restaurant quality. Listened to some [[Sabotage by the Beastie Boys]] in there as well,
