# [[2021-11-14]] Showering for the first time at Carrie's, Squirting Lotion Bottle, Fixing Shower


[[Staying the Night with Carrie]]

I've never felt so clean!! It was truly such a crazy realization to see how spacious [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]]'s facilities are compared to [[Grace Hopper|Hopper]]'s. They have so much room and the ability to put both caddie's inside the shower! And the floor is clean enough that I can imagine being comfortable putting my feet (though I won't).

I got out and felt so refreshed with Carrie's skincare products. I walked out and then we joked as she tried to fill her moisturizing cream by pumping the large container (there were jokes to be made).

Finally, we fixed the shower together, remarking on torque for the hinge on the handheld shower device and switching between that and the shower fixture.
