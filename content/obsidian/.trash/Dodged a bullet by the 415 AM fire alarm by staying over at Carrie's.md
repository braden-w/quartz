> Dear Hoppers & Hopplites,  
>   
> For the denizens of 189 Elm Street [Hopper College proper], the 4:15 am fire alarm this morning, after the 8:15 pm fire alarm last night, was quite the wake-up call.  
>   
> The 8 pm one was a scheduled fire drill. **And yes, we should all be trooping out to Cross Campus, which is our collective safe zone.** With only two gates in our cozy courtyard, we shouldn't be gathering there. Please do head to Cross Campus next time you hear a fire alarm.  
>   
> The 4 am fire alarm was unscheduled. The Yale Fire Marshal has since determined that it was due to balloons in our dining hall!  
>   
> Balloons from the Trident Ceremony drifted up to the ceiling, and have been slowly descending. Eventually they intersected with some key beams and fire alarm mechanisms ... not kidding.  
>   
> This is all a little surprising. After all, if I recall, Hephaestus, the god of fire, fashioned Poseidon's trident. They should be united in perfect amity.
