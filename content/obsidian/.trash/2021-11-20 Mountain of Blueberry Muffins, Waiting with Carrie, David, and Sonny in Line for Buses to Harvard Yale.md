# [[2021-11-20]] Mountain of Blueberry Muffins, Waiting with Carrie, David, and [[Sonny]] in Line for Buses to Harvard Yale

Today was the day! I woke up and went to see a mountain of blueberry muffins in the Franklin dining hall. I brought some, among them being the [[Naked Hummel Nitrate Free Hot Dog]], and walked to Hopper while Carrie brushed her teeeth and readied herself with her suitemates.
