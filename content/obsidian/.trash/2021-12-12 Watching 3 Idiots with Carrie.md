# [[2021-12-12]] Watching [[3 Idiots]] with Carrie



It was so wholesome! I had a great time the entire time. We laughed so much and engaged with the deep lessons. In the meantime, I called Bryce in the background as the Valorant final was in progress.

It was worth it missing out of the gun buddy for this moment. I feel closer to Carrie, having shared a great movie that was integral to my childhood (similar to her with [[Mean Girls]]).

We had a joke about the [[Wearing a Helmet During Sex]] referring to Pia's helmet, and Cory's red and yellow helmet.
