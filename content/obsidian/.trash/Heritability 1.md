# Heritability 1
- The proportion of phenotypical variance that you can attribute to genetic variance

## More Clarification
- It is a measure of variance
- How much can I ascribe the trait to genetics
- Does not necessarily imply that there is a gene for it
- When we refer to [[Heritability]] of height, it doesn't measure **height in the first place**, but the **difference** of height in the first place
