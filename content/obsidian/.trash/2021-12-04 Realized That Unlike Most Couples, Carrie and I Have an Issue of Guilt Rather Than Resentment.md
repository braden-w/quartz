# [[2021-12-04]] Realized That [[Unlike Most Couples, Carrie and I Have an Issue of Guilt Rather Than Resentment]]

 

[[Carrie]]

Our biggest struggles are not resentment from having unrecognized sacrifice, but feeling guilty in having the other person sacrifice so much for each other.

This is because we are both [[ENFJ]]s and [[ENFJ|INFJ]]s, and [[Give and Take|Giver]]s. We readily sacrifice for each other.
