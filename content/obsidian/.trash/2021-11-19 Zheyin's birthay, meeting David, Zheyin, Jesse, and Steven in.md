# [[2021-11-19]] Zheyin's birthay, meeting David, Zheyin, Jesse, and Steven in



Walked into Zheyin's birthday.

Met Julian, which we had met at Branford earlier when we went [[2021-10-29 Jumping butteries (Berkeley, Davenport, Trumbull) with Sonny and David, playing so much Ping Pong, basketball, foosball.|Buttery Hopping with the Boys]]. Talked a bit and played Zheyin's Cards Against Humanity game together (on notepads).

Then met [[Jesse Roy]], who was a big fan of our app. We exchanged Spotifys, and we talked about how we could get spreadsheets and specials for the buttery book together.
