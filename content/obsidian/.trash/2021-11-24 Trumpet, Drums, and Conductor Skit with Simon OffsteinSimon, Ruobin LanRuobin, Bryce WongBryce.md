# [[2021-11-24]] Trumpet, Drums, and Conductor Skit with Simon OffsteinSimon, Ruobin LanRuobin, Bryce WongBryce



[[Boy Scouts]]

A band director (Simon) was having a lot of trouble with one of his trumpeters. He stops the whole orchestra and reprimands the trumpeter, then starts them again.

Finally, in front of the whole orchestra, he said: “When a musician just can’t handle his instrument and doesn’t improve when given help, they take away the instrument, give him two sticks, and make him a drummer”.

Then Ruobin yelled: “And if he can’t handle even that, they take away one of his sticks and make him a conductor”.

The whole Camporee ROARED. It was truly so hilarious. Bryce considers this one of our most fire moments, and was truly the best from camporee.
