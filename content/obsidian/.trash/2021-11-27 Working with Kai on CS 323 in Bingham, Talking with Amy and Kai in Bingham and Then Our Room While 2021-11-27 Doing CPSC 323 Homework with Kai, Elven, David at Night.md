# [[2021-11-27]] Working with Kai on CS 323 in Bingham, Talking with Amy and Kai in Bingham and Then Our Room While [[2021-11-27 Doing CPSC 323 Homework with Kai, Elven, David at Night]]



Talk about my work at [[Emerge]], and a nice discussion about our majors, what we're interested in studying, etc.

During this time, Vanessa and Alex Chun came in and rearranged Vanessa and Amy Brook's room.
