Joceline to Prom, Korean ribs, chicken, rice and fries
Â 
Had a dream that I had taken Joceline to prom. Driving in a random car that was quite pleasant. Afterwards, here was a Korean restaurant where I could buy Korean ribs, chicken, rice, and a huge brown bag (like a lunch bag) of fries for about $10 per person ($19.28) total for us both.
