# [[2022-01-14]] [[Card]] to Carrie for Four Months

Dear Carrie,

Happy 4 months! Thank you for being such an amazing person to date. I have spent far too much time thinking about how I should organize this card :') but with the end of winter break drawing near, I wanted to share this list of things I thought about when I missed you, and am eternally grateful for :)

- The way you call me love
- The way you make me the best version of myself. Since dating you, I have become move open to my emotions and communicating with my family, earlier to meetings, more mindful, share gratitude more often (esp with my mom and dad), and just feel nicer and better as a person
- The way you latch to our Spotify. Always look forward to it
- The way you are empathetic - Listening to my rants, from HCC to the COVID Situation - The way you share gratitude with me all the time - The way you're an empath lmao - The way you got me to cry and feel catharsis and I feel a desire to share things with you, both the good and bad - The way I can be myself around you
- The way you spasm
- The way you make me so unbelievably horny
- The way you're so thoughtful - The way I'm in awe how you meticulous|y plan and write cards to your friends, and made gifts for them that take obviously large amounts of time (or take Selina's party, which took so much calling and setup and waiting) - The way your gifts and cards make me feel you are really thinking of me
- The way you're humble, to the point you carry group projects, plan parties, and clean without wanting to make a big deal (about how freaking OP you are)
- The way you're too considerate - Eating alone in Morse so I could eat with Yvonne - Offering Kaitlyn to hold her stuff so she could put un her jacket
- The war you made me feel when calling me during break and coming to Mammoth
- The way we are in life sync, like the time I asked you, "are you upset with me" right after you had a nightmare
- The way you are such a good teacher and helped me lose my pottery and baking virginity
- The way every time I see you, I am reminded of my potential
- The way you make me so grateful to have 20/20 vision so can see your beautiful face in the morning ^\_^
- The way you spark joy in me

Love,

Braden
