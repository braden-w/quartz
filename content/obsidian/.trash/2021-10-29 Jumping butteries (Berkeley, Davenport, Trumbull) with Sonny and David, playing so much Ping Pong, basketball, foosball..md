# [[2021-10-29]] Jumping butteries (Berkeley, Davenport, Trumbull) with [[Sonny]] and David, playing so much Ping Pong, basketball, foosball.




First, we headed over to Berkeley's buttery. It was so classy! On the way there, we saw three people in pure white and joked that they were asking for another paintball attack.

I played so much ping pong with Sonny, enjoying the extra space to play further away from the table behind the baseline. I did lots of smashes, and kept my weight low to the ground the entire time based off the tip I saw on tennis Instagram. Afterwards, I called Bryce and we talked about his essays.

Basketball in Berkeley. We played [[Horse (basketball game)]], and I tried a bunch of high percentage shots, which Sonny was unable to make some and we GUFFAWED together. Afterwards, I launched two back-to-back from behind the backboard, which was CRAZY. The others struggled to replicate it, and it was a good time. Afterwards, we watched Ian and another friend play ping pong, and Ian was super good! ^50b732

Afterwards, we visited Davenport. We meet Davonne, who I remarked reminded me a lot of [[Bilal]] due to his curly hair, white shoes with exposed ankles, and mannerisms. It was great meeting him! Though the buttery was closed, we saw glimpses of the DPops concert.

Finally, we visited Trumbull. On the way, saw a guy in a white designer shirt with black stripes and blue glasses who seemed zoned out but let us in and was super chill and funny. Got my results for [[Daily Notes/2021-10-18 CPSC 323 Midterm, learning to reverse engineer! #Daily_NoteMoments]], and got a 73! David and I both did pretty well. Talked to Sonny about rough grades in 223, then talked about my [[Grade deflation anecdote from Lily in Williams (it's less stressful)]]
