# [[2021-12-04]] Delicious Hopper Holiday Dinner



https://photos.app.goo.gl/ks2trg75EVF5jtMAA

Had an absolute blast.

- At first, ate outside. I called Carrie but felt a little lonely, so went inside
- Delicious beef. David remarked it was the best beef he's had
- Really nice bread
- Cod wrapped with olives and leaves. It was so good in texture!
- Drinking nice smooth Eggnog, which David said tasted like Melted Ice Cream
- Toffee cake
- Risotto and lobster pasta
- Talking with Rayyan, [[Sonny]], David
- Near the end, Carrie finished up her work in [[Humanities Quadrangle|HQ]] and decided to stop by at Hopper and join us (eating quickly along the way)

Overall, we all concluded that this was wayy better than [[2021-12-03 Sophomore Dinner at Commons, Parade]]

Afterwards, went with Carrie to [[2021-12-04 Talking and Napping with Carrie in Franklin After No Hockey Harvard Vs. Yale]]
