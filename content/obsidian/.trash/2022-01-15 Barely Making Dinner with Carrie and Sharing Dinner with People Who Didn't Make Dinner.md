# [[2022-01-15]] Barely Making Dinner with Carrie and Sharing Dinner with People Who Didn't Make Dinner



- Ran out in the cold with [[Carrie]] and barely made it to dinner in time!
- Got 4 boxed lunches of Ethiopian Chicken and Vegetables
- Afterwards, two girls missed dinner and were really sad. We offered them two of the boxes (since we could clearly not finish) and they were very grateful!!
