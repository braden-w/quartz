# [[2021-11-18]] Thanksgiving Dinner at Hopper



1. [[Yale Buttery Book]] release! We got super hyped with [[Bilal]] and [[Sonny]].
2. Talked with [[Ryan Xie|Ryan]]. He was into [[Malia Kuo|Malia]] and asked me about what her name was, and I shared but also that (definitely wanted to be a respectful gentleman).
3. Delicious bread pudding, salmon, hot cider, carrot cake, and more! So decadent, and passing Dean Francis outside told me that dinner is soooo good.
