# [[2021-11-01]] HCC Meeting, Costumes in Hopper Common Room, [[Staying the Night with Carrie]], Insomnia Cookies with Carrie and Listening to CROWN, BTS, and [[I Got Depression]]



## HCC Meeting

- Renting [[Commons]] is \$40,000 :O

## Favorite Costumes

- [[Iron Man]], or baked potato—HILARIOUS wearing all tin foil and making loud clunking noises when he walked
- Zoom man—Wearing suit on top, pajamas on bottom
- Iceman and Goose—Nostalgia for [[Top Gun]]

## Insomnia Cookies and Music

- While I lied prone on her bed, Carrie remarked that I'm [[dummy thicc]]
- Putting hands on \*\*\* and opening from behind drover her crazy when we were in our underwear
- Listened to some music with Carrie the next morning. I started humming the beginning of Crown by Tomorrow X. Together, and that led to us starting to play music together
