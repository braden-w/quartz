# [[2021-11-20]] Harvard Yale Game

We sat next to an alumni from 70 years ago, and he talked . His partner joked about the smell of weed when we were talking about who would dare to smoke weed during a game.

We had a CRAZY touchdown where we went for the 4th down at the 30 yard line instead of punting it, and ran it all the way!!
