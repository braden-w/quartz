# [[2021-12-04]] Jen's Birthday with a David, Carrie, Cecelia, Sam, Twee

 

## Exploding Kittens

- David pull a power move and placed the on the top, a power move
- Carrie shuffled and I drew a card, which was safe. But the next two cards (three because second then added it right on top )
- I did a change in the future and realized there were 3 bombs in a row, so I just put them back exactly the same way

David gave Jen a 3D printed contraption, which was so thoughtful! Carrie and I were going crazy about it later.

## Return to Hopper, Emotional Breakdown

Had an emotional breakdown while having Carrie walk me back all the way to Hopper. So we decided to sit in my room and talk it out.

We had a wholesome conversation and exchanged how we were so grateful for each other.
