# [[2021-11-19]] Grady's Grill with Carrie, then Mint Bars with Ice Cream Dinner at Hopper



Went to Grady Morrison's grill in Vanderbilt with Carrie, Selina, David. Carrie paid \$5 for each of us. I ended up eating three delicious handburgers, while David ate two hot dogs and a burger. Selina and Carrie each ate one per person. They were delicious!! Very juicy and nice with melted cheese and BBQ sauce. Thanked Grady and William (his friend manning the grill) and saw Jerry Feng and Nico along the way.

Afterwards, David went with Jerry to the Slifka center, where he would meet [[Jesse Roy]] and go to [[2021-11-19 Zheyin's birthay, meeting David, Zheyin, Jesse, and Steven in]]. I went with Carrie to eat a delicious ice cream and chocolate chips on a mint bar in the Hopper Dining Hall (with some gumbo), before [[2021-11-19 Helping Carrie with CS50 Quiz During the Night, Recovering Massive amounts of points, Missing a Few Things]].
