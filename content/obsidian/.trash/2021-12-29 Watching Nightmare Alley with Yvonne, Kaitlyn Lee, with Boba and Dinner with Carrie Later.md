# [[2021-12-29]] Watching [[Nightmare Alley]] with Yvonne, [[Kaitlyn Lee]], with Boba and Dinner with Carrie Later



[[Nightmare Alley]] was initially slow, but the ending was quite a welcome twist. Talking with Yvonne and Kaitlyn about life, and it was great to catch up!

On the way there, Yvonne asked me for my phone and then CALLED CARRIE out of nowhere and asked her how she couldn't come. She offered and insisted on having her join us (which was so nice), but also embarrassing HAHA

## Picking up Carrie

Afterwards, we picked up Carrie after she so generously dropped off a souvenir from her Hawaii trip. Together, we had:

- Boba at [[BOPOMOFO CAFE]]
- Noodles at [[Killer Noodles]]

And Carrie and I shared [[How Carrie and I Met]]

- How we changed over the years - Relationships were less important
