# [[2021-11-16]] Eating Cod in Schwarzman, Helping Carrie with [[CS50]], Vanessa Strange Encounter

# Daily_Note/Moments

Wrapping up my [[2021-11-16 Did My Meta Interview, First Coding Interview]], and helped Carrie with [[CS50]] finance pset.

Vanessa then came and said hi. She was strangely fixated on me and ignored Carrie, and was like "Wasn't Finance due 3 days ago"? So strange but funny. She left and then left a lingering hand on my shoulder. Carrie and I would later laugh about this in [[2021-11-17 Coping Mechanism Laughing with Carrie]]
