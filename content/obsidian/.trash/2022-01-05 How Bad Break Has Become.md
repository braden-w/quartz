- I was scared by how fast my opinion of people change, in response to - Carrie's brief message about how she couldn't come to Mammoth without acknowledging the cost of switching - The abrupt end to our call
- Hoping I would recover from that feeling of resentment(which it did, thanks to [[2022-01-05 Calling Carrie About 2022-01-05 How Bad Break Has Become]]

- College Essays with Bryce interrupting my work
- In general, I really am feeling a lot of burn out and no motivation for doing my work

Hope this all works out and improves over time.
