# [[2021-11-19]] Helping Carrie with [[CS50]] Quiz During the Night, Recovering Massive amounts of points, Missing a Few Things



Had some moments where I was blazing code and felt so good, letting out an excited yelp.

During this time, I let in [[Shawn Pan]] to our suite so I could meet [[Toby (Shawn Pan's Friend)]], [[Eric (Shawn Pan's Friend)]], [[Jerry (Shawn Pan's Friend)]]

Had an amazing time with the writing WESUCK in Python (writing a bunch of for loops, converting the file to lines, and realizing that the reason the spacing was bad was that each line in the file ended with `\n` , so I used a [0:-1] to solve it.

Afterwards, I did another C problem where I iterated over a bunch of stuff and passed all the `assert` test cases with `isalnum, isdigit, etc.`

Afterwards, I went out and joined [[2021-11-19 Zheyin's birthay, meeting David, Zheyin, Jesse, and Steven in]].
