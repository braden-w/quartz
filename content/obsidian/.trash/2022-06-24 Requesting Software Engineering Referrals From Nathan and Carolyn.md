# [[2022-06-24]] Requesting Software Engineering Referrals From Nathan and Carolyn

## Requesting Referral From Nathan Ahn (Meta)
Hey Nathan, I hope all is going well with you this summer—is now a bad time to ask for a huge favor? I was wondering if you would be opposed to writing a referral for me at Meta—I hope that the time we spent working in YHack, tackling problem sets, and chatting together could provide some insight. If you are, that's totally ok and I understand! I'm just trying to navigate the recruitment process in any way I can. If there's ever a way I can help you out or if you're ever down to practice Leetcode together, I'm down!

## Requesting Referral From Carolyn Qu (Google)
Hey Carolyn, I hope all is going well with you this summer—is now a bad time to ask for a huge favor? I was wondering if you would be opposed to drafting a referral for me at Google—I hope that the time we spent working in YHack, debugging projects, and chatting about web development could provide some insight. If you are, that's totally ok and I understand! I'm just trying to navigate the recruitment process in any way I can. If there's ever a way I can help you out or if you're ever down to practice Leetcode together, I'm down!

## Response to Carolyn
Hey Braden,

Of course I am open to and want to give out as many referrals as possible for google since it helped me get my foot in the door, but I will be totally honest with you — the text you sent me didn’t make me feel great. I had perceived all of our previous interactions and work together to have been done because we were friends and were having fun, not for it to prove that we were good developers. Regardless, right now I can’t give referrals since things haven’t opened up, but ask me again when recruitment season starts and then we can talk! I would genuinely love to give you a referral, but I hope you can see how your wording made me feel. I hope London has been treating you well :)

Oh my goodness Carolyn, I’m so sorry about that! I didn’t mean for my words to come out that way—but reading back I can definitely see the interpretation. I meant to say that in addition to being friends and spending time together, it just so happens we occasionally talked coding stuff—I just wanted to make sure the request was intentional and relevant to the topic (that I really want to ask you!), but by no means was it the focus. Thank you so much for letting me know and telling me—I really appreciate it and respect you for expressing how the message made you feel (also, if you were me, how would you prefer to word this? Always open for advice on this). I’m excited and grateful but also please, it’s not time sensitive and you have no obligation to do it!
