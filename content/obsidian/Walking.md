# Walking
Ears over shoulders, shoulders over hips, and hips over knees

Hung by a string Engage your core and suck in slightly

Walking is pulling

Pinch your shoulders

Don't put weight on heels but toes

Flex the ankle

Roll the entire ball of your foot

First your pinky, then every until the big toe
