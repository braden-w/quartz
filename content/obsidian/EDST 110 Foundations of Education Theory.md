- The purpose of education is opportunity
- The tension between education as a public good and education as a private good (Labaree 2018)
> - By the turn of the 20th century, schooling was still regarded mainly as a public good, but the mission had begun to shift from politics (creating citizens) to economics (training capable workers who can help promote broad prosperity). Over the subsequent decades, however, growing numbers of Americans came to view schooling mainly as a private good, producing credentials that allow individuals to get ahead, or stay ahead, in the competition for money and social status.
	- Sure, in the name of fairness and justice, parents could choose to send their children to the same lousy schools that less fortunate people are forced to attend. But even if they support eforts to improve the quality of educational opportunities for other people’s children, what kind of parent would put their children’s future at risk for a political principle?
In short, the pursuit of private educational goods drives most parents’ immediate decisions, while eforts to promote the public good are deferred to the indeterminate realm of political action for possible resolution in the distant future. It’s not that anybody wants to punish other people’s children; it’s just that they need to take care of their own

- Become good citizens (James Baldwin)
	- Some racially iffy bits, but a push for good content
- Children should be taught good morals and to love their country (Kathleene O'Toole)
	- Should children learn a problematic or celebratory perspective of their country's history?
- More specialization to get better industry (Woodrow Wilson)
	- “We want one class of persons to have a liberal education, and we want another class of persons, a very much larger class of necessity in every society, to forgo the privilege of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks."
	- The higher your income is today, the less you regret the major you chose back in college (Washington Post, Sept. 2022)
- Private good (Murray Rothbard)
	- "natural state of affairs is for the person to have charge of the child"
- Common good
	- Schooling is only a subset of education
- Creating community (Paolo Freire)
	- Culture Circle Activitiy done in class and Freirian debrief

## [[2022-09-07]] Reading Response
The Teacher Wars by Dana Goldstein is a fascinating book that chronicles the history of teaching in America. Goldstein highlights the various changes that have taken place in the profession over the years, from the early days when teaching was seen as a noble calling to the present day when teachers are often underpaid and undervalued.

One of the most interesting aspects of the book is the way Goldstein discusses the changing perception of teachers, depending on whether they are male or female. In the early days of teaching, when the profession was dominated by men, teachers were seen as intelligent and knowledgeable. However, as women began to enter the profession in larger numbers, they were often seen as moral guardians of children, rather than as intellectual leaders. This change in perception has had a profound effect on the way teachers are treated, both in terms of pay and respect.

Overall, The Teacher Wars is a well-researched and insightful book that provides a detailed look at the history of teaching in America. It is sure to be of interest to anyone who is interested in the education system, or in the changing role of women in the workforce.

- What purpose of education showing up so far?
- How was local control reflected in Puritan?
- Suppresion of black education
- Only about 10% of education funding is from federal government, 45% local spending (property taxes), 45% state spending
- What are the benefits of an education system with extensive local control? What are the negatives?
Local funding comprises a significant share of the education system, and locals often have a greater vested interest in their education system than education systems beyond their local scope. However, local control also leads to disparities between different areas, as people may seek to impose their values or exclude others.
