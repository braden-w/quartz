It established forty hours as a standard work week for many industries. In other words, if you wanted to have an employee work longer than forty hours, they would have to be paid overtime. This very much, largely concerned manufacturing and industrial jobs, jobs where there was an hourly component to the work, jobs where the biggest knob you had to turn in terms of impacting the difficulty of the work was how many hours people were actually working. This was the context for something like a standardized work week made since knowledge workers have been relatively exempt from that law because it is a different type of situation. Knowledge work its way more autonomous. The number of hours you are working, or expected to work, don't necessarily mean a lot. In a lot of knowledge work jobs.

We can obtain informaion without having to direct our gaze specifically to one location. Maybe we can obtain information from multiple locations. Indeed, we can. Without getting too far down the rabbit hole of how vision and cognition relate, because we've done episodes on that previously, and simply focusing on the tools that can be incorporated to improve focus and concentration. Here's what i recommend. Set ourself a low bar at first, and set a timer, and try to focus on one location for 30 seconds, and that's it for that day. The next day you might add five seconds, and then the next day, five seconds. After that. If you missidate, no big deal. Simply do the practice for the same amount of time that you did the last time that you did the practice. And then gradually try and increase the amount of time that you can focus on one visual location overtly, by looking directly at that location, if you like. And if you feel you have the ability, you can try and do this through covert attention and focus, by looking straightforward, for instance, and attending to something in the corner of the room, and trying to do that for 30 seconds. You'll find that that's quite a bit harder. And then extending that by five seconds every time you do the practice. This is something that i don't think you necessarily have to build up to being able to do for a full hour in order to extract the benefits. In fact, the best way to think about this practice is as a means to get into a focused state. If you remember back about an hour or so ago, i was talking about how focus states are not a drop all the way in and then exit type phenomenon. We don't just drop into a focus state the same way we don't drop into the peakue performance of a workout. We warm up. So what i recommend is having a 30 second to three minute period at the beginning of about a focus where you're going to do work or physical work, and anchoring your vision to one location somewhere in the room. Or if you want to do it covertly, you can do that, setting a timer and trying to do that for anywhere from 30 seconds to three minutes. What you're doing when you exercise that practice, as you are ramping up neural activity within the neural circuits that create focus and concentration. Then i would stop looking at that location, or that covert location, and then i would move to the work that you're trying to do, either mental work or physical work. And if about half way through your 90 minute bout, or at some point in your 90 minute bout of work or exercise, you feel that your concentration is drifting rather than look at your phone and scroll through the thousands of contexts that exist within social medea of your phone, try just picking a location, again, on the wall, focusing back on that location, using that as a ramp up to then direct your focus back towards if your weight training sets and ryps that you might be performing. If you're running, you might do this. Or cycling, you might do this by focusing on a particular location and really homing in on that location. Physically d this is a practice thit a lot of athletes use, in fact. And if you're, say, doing musical practice or math, well, then you'd want to focus on something other than the task that you're trying to perform. But again, using visual focus as a way to ramp up and increase your overall ability to focus and concentrate, and then applying that to whatever it is that you're trying to learn or perform. Next, i' like to talk about compounds that can improve concentration and focus. And these are most often consumed as supplements, although some of them, i should mention, can also be derived from food. Again, i just want to remind you that there are things, in this case, compounds, that can modulate a biological mechanism, that is, can modulate focus and concentration.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#012400-using-visual-focus-on-one-location-to-improve-concentration><h3 id=012400-using-visual-focus-on-one-location-to-improve-concentration><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[01:24:00] Using Visual Focus on One Location to Improve Concentration</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/afaa5067-c36c-4a47-8c36-8e6e537c9833 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 3minÔ∏è (01:21:28 - 01:25:03)</a>

So it's not like many of these currencies are not linked to the gold standard. You know, the us. Kind of famously came off that in he 19 seventies, for instance. But if you read radalio and all the stuff tha he talks about, there's thousands of currencies that have been in existence over time. And basically all of them eventually get disconnected from a backing of like, hard commodities, and then they get over inflated and emprinted. And so in times of stress, ah, you know, with nixon, i guess it was, like, in the us. It was te venam war, somehing like that. It drove government spending. And so under times of stress.

And, you know, i spent, ah id, spent eght or 90 years of my life at that point, kind of building this thing.

I feel very passionate about it. So, ah, yes, i'm not going to go, like, i need to make this the company that i want to work at. And what was really interesting was that there was such a huge outpouring of support. So i, i knew that it would be controversial when i would get attacked. And predictably, you know, there was some, ah, some journalists and, you know, new york times and all these people who kind of like went and started writing hit pieces on the company. After shortly, they're after and they basely just call people who've left the company and like, you know, can get quotes on whatever they want, and then they'll write a story. So, mainstremedia, i lost a lot of trust in mainstremedia, frankly, after that. And of course, it's kind of become obvious since then that, ah, most meanstremedia is like hyper politicized at this it's basely either super left or super right, and it's not really that focused on a truth. So that's, that's kind of unfortunate, cause i think journalism's actuallyke really important in society. So that that whole thing got eroded in the us. Luckily, there's sort of new media people like you a and a whole bunch of people block post help that statement.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br><br>The the 95 people that remained is this still something to struggle with, because there is also culture f the broader text pase.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#020210-are-you-optimizing-for-virtue-signalling-or-solving-a-particular-problem><h3 id=020210-are-you-optimizing-for-virtue-signalling-or-solving-a-particular-problem><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[02:02:10] Are You Optimizing For Virtue Signalling Or Solving a Particular Problem?</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/00db2e6e-680d-4777-bb25-af22ebc95e0e rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 57secÔ∏è (02:01:17 - 02:02:14)</a>

The the systems that make java script run as fast as it does right now are kind of miracles of modern engineering. In many ways, it does feel like it is not an optimal language for all the things that it's being used for, or an optimal distribution system to build huge aps. And something like this without type systems and so on. Im but i think for a lot of people it does reasonably the necessary things. It's still a sea flavored language. It's still up younow braces and semicolon language. It's not hard for people to be trained in java script and then understand the roots of where it came from. I think garbage collection is unequivocally a good thing for most programmes to be written in. It's funny that i still, just this morning, i was on, i was seeing a twitter thread of a bunch of really senior game dev people arguing about the the virtues and costs of garbage collection. And you will run into some people that are top notch programmers that just say, no, this is literally not a good thing. That jusit makes you lazy. Yes, that it makes you not think about things. And i do disagree. I think that the there is so much objective data on the the vulnerabilities that have happened in c and c plus plus programmes, sometimes written by the best programmers in the world, it's like nobody is good enough to avoid ever shooting themselves in the foot with that. You right enough code, you're going to shoot yourself in the foot. And garbage collection is a very great thing for the vast majority of programmes. It's only when you get into the tightest of real time things that you start saying, it's like, no, the garbage collection has more costs than it has benefits for me there. But that's not 99 plus % of all the soft wear in world. So jabascript is not terrible in those ways. And i and so much of programming, is not the language itself. It's the intra structure around ever, you know, that surrounds it, all the libraries that you can get and the different stuff that you can ways you can deploy it.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#3355-energy-efficiency-is-not-the-best-metric><h3 id=3355-energy-efficiency-is-not-the-best-metric><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[33:55] Energy Efficiency Is Not The Best Metric</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/369559a0-7eb2-426c-a6d2-0bb97d937d0a rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (32:25 - 33:57)</a>

You move little things around on it, and you interact like that. Maybe you go to additional screens as you move. But arcade games and consoles had this wonderful ability to just have a big world that you're slowly moving your window through. And that was for se types of games, the kind of action, exploration, adventure games, that was a super, superimportant thing. And pc games just didn't do that.

He couldn't actually sell them, and he had more inventory than he had customers. And we don't think about richard branson like that to day. We imagine sort of that he landed on the top of the mountain, you know, as if he was born. There were so many, i think all the people that we see is successful to day in whatever realm you're imagining, they all began by making terrible, ridiculous and stupid mistakes.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#katherine-boyle---investing-for-america---invest-like-the-best-ep290><h1 id=katherine-boyle---investing-for-america---invest-like-the-best-ep290><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Katherine Boyle - Investing for America - [Invest Like the Best, EP.290]</h1></a><p><img src="https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fssl-static.libsyn.com%2Fp%2Fassets%2F6%2F4%2F3%2Fb%2F643b73da108c5f2440be95ea3302a6a1%2FILTB_Cover_Art.png&w=200&h=200" width=200 alt=Cover|200></p><a href=#snips-9><h2 id=snips-9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Snips</h2></a><a href=#0644-silicon-valley-is-abundant-long-time-horizons-washington-is-zero-sum-short-ones><h3 id=0644-silicon-valley-is-abundant-long-time-horizons-washington-is-zero-sum-short-ones><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[06:44] Silicon Valley is Abundant Long Time Horizons, Washington is Zero Sum Short Ones</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/cf559288-84c0-42b1-ab3f-7078aeeceb2f rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (05:00 - 07:36)</a>

And then, having investigated do d quite a bit, it sort of seems like it's the opposite, like move very slow and make sure nothing breaks. What created this change? You sort of reference the early ties between government and technology, whether that beang semi conduct s or defence, or the darpa initiatives, a lot of these things that were incredibly important. What happened? Why did that critical linkage change during this recent period?</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br><br>I think there's a number of reasons. And i always point to what i would call a very non obvious reason why i think washington has a hard time working with silkan valley, and it's because the cultures are so prat so if you think about washington media, or even electoral culture, it's a zerosome game. Every two years there's an election. If you're talking about media, it's every dayt actually, i would say journalists actually function more like hedge fun managers, and that they have their marks every day. Did they go viral on the internet? Did they get the front page of the newspaper? And so they're playing a rep game every day where only one person can whim. So very used to zero some and very used to short time horizons, where silikan valley operates in positive sume games and long time horizons. The abundanc culture of silican valley is a real thing. The more companies that exist here is actually good for the eco system. You see the same investors investing in multiple companies. That great. And so i think that there's a fundamental, just misunderstanding between washington and silican valley of how the cultures work. And so when you actually look at that in a very micro level, in government, or, say, the d o d, where the d o d is used to, as you said, move very slow, make sure nothing breaks. I don't want to lose my job. I don't want to get fired because i invested the wrong company. And now we don't have drones. There's this culture of, let's make sure everything is going to have cover, that everyone me know, crosses the teas, dots the eyes. And meanwhile, we are competing against competitors that do not have that same sort of view of how technology should be built. Russia and china, our adversaries, have very different vews of their countries and their authoritarian regimes that can actually tell their innovators their engineers exactly what they want them to do. Palmer lucky talks about this in very stark terms, where it's actually easier, if you're an authoritarian regime to get the technology that you want. It's actually hard, i think, in some ways, to work through a procurement regime where your trying to convince people that they should work with the government. But what i'd say is changed over the last few years that's really dramatic, is that silkin valley wants to work with government. When i moved here almost ten years ago, it certainly wasn't the case. And so i do think there has been a sea change where founders in particular, are excited about these categories and are excited about working with the do i'm sure there's tons of nuance around the arguments on both sides of whether or not america is exceptional in some way.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#discover-your-inner-peace-with-this-key-secret-ep-1307><h1 id=discover-your-inner-peace-with-this-key-secret-ep-1307><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Discover Your Inner Peace With This Key Secret EP 1307</h1></a><p><img src="https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimage.simplecastcdn.com%2Fimages%2F66a92839-6dce-416e-906d-9362eb76bfed%2F000bc2d0-03f7-4b10-a4a4-c4d687b25002%2F3000x3000%2F451fdbbec0fc179970adc9f7ab2a9fd82921aa5dc5fcd8f07af1223f642a6fe0066d4d173bfb5a5371c1db159f7b9710814d74047a883038e8ccbbb7f960454b.jpg%3Faid%3Drss_feed&w=200&h=200" width=200 alt=Cover|200></p><a href=#snips-10><h2 id=snips-10><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Snips</h2></a><a href=#014132-greatness-is-reflecting-your-light-in-the-way-it-should-manifest><h3 id=014132-greatness-is-reflecting-your-light-in-the-way-it-should-manifest><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[01:41:32] Greatness is Reflecting Your Light, In The Way It Should Manifest</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/3a44658b-34b9-4bc4-935d-64b8ddfdc1a1 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 5minÔ∏è (01:39:28 - 01:44:41)</a>

Just love. Love is the highest truth, the deepest truth, the most powerful, infinite presence on earth. And don't lose your ability to love because of the nonsense games of your own mind. So don't love up in stories and expectations and dramas, and don't relegate love only to the very select few with whom you've actually chosen to spend your life. Love everyone. See that that soul, that spirit, that being, that divine in all love trees love the flowers as they open their petals to the sun. Just love. Just allow your internal love manufacturing plant to be on 24 seven. And the third message is, recognize that you are here as an instrument, an instrument in the hands of the divine its like saint francis of assisi says. O, lord, make me an instrument of thy mercy. Where there is darkness, let me bring light. We are instruments, and that's critical for two reasons. Number one, because with an instrument, what matters is not how beautiful it is or how covered in gold it is, but actually how effective it is. If i say to you, oh my god, i've got this beautiful new hammer for you. You're just going to love it. It's covered with diamonds and gold and but every time you try to hammer something in suishes because it's made not of metal, but of something else. Well, it doesn't matter how beautiful it is, it doesn't actually work. You need that hammer to be able to hammer in the nails. And as instruments, we need to realize that we are here to be not diamond bedactimand if you want to be, do it. There's certainly no problem with being covered in diamonds. But remember that that's not actually the highest goal. The highest goal is to be an effective instrument of the divine flow here on earth. And there is nothing small. There is nothing big. There is nothing more important or less important. It's not about the what you do, it's about how you do it. And to realize that we are here to be instruments, channels of love, of truth, of healing for the planet.

So like most things, if given two options, you can of course have beltst almost every trait that we know of in unity has mixtures of nurture and nature. Some of them are purely nurture, so others, most people probave faml wit twin studies. But twins, tothiese are one of the best ways to gauge how much is something nurture versus nature, how much of it is really ingrained and has probably less ability to change, for how much can you really train? So height, for example, is one of the most obvious inheritable traits, but it doesn't have one gene, and probably has at least 50 or 60 genes that contribute to height. So it's not like a gean for height. Some people tik it lik the gen for cistic fibrosis. Now that in that case, that's true, there is one gen that, if you have mutations, you get sistic fibrosis, os a disease. But for other other traits that are much more complicated, they can have dozens or even hundreds of gens that influence your risk and what appears. But from twin studies, you take monopsycotic twins, twins ha are identical, and you can clearly tell t they lok toy, ave the same facial structure, similar intonations, similar even likes. And you compare them to di igotic twins. Or when you haveve fraternal twins, you can havecome male and female, for example, in the same uterus. And those are di igotic twins, or two sigots. So in that case, they're fitesor 50 % of their diana, but they shared the same womb. And that you can look at is the what's the diffrene to an identical twins versus fraternal twins? And o calculate that difference for any trait, and that gives you an estimate of the heritability h squared. So that's what we've been doing for almost every trait in humanity for the past a hundred years. Have been tring to measure this. And religion is one that's a negative controls. If you separate people and see what religion they become, there's no gen for religion, or what religion you choose. So that often as their correlation there is zero, because it should be.

This has been already published and well documented, but as alluding to, more and more we'll see people that you just want to temporarily change your genes functions and change their activity. So the best example this is for betathalsemia. We all have hemoglobin in our blood that carries oxygen around. And we are an adult, it's a different version. It's a different gene. You have one gene when your fetus, called ftus, fedal hemoglobin. When youre adult, you have a different gene. But they both are making a protin that carries oxygen. When you're, after you're born, the feta hemoglobin gene gets just turned offt just, it goes away, and you replace it with adult hemoglobin. But if you're a gen for hemoglobin is bad, as an adult, tit, one of the therapes will et's turn back on the gene that you had when you were a foetus. And it's actually already led to cures for sicklecell and betathalsema in this past year. So it's tis extraordinaryd well, you already have some of the genetic solutions in your body. Why don't we just reactivate them and see if you can live? And indeed, you can't. O i think we'll see more of that.

But i think we'll start to see that more in the next ten nd 20 years. And eventually, as i describe in the book, you can get to recreation ollof genetics. You can say, well, i want to turn some geans on just for this week end, because i'm going to a high altitude, so i'd like to prepare for that indstead.

And i think that part of it is, i think there are ex cup two quick answers to that. One is the attentional one. So our attentional field, when they draw attention to it, the those, what could be very small deviations from perfect symmetry, or whatever they are, become magnified in our attentional field. But the other is that, um, who we have as mate is also a reflection of our own status.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#3408-long-term-pair-bonding><h3 id=3408-long-term-pair-bonding><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[34:08] Long Term Pair Bonding</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/c657d965-4488-466b-a677-33e1b9c5b0a7 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 55secÔ∏è (33:12 - 34:08)</a>

That's the woman for me. Women very rarely do that. Most men don't do that either. But men are much more inclined to fall in love at first sight. That's because they prioritize physical appearance. Why? Because physical appearance provides that this wealth of information about a woman's fertility status. And this is from an evolutionary perspective, from a purely reproductive perspective. In an business school, they would call it job one. Job one is you have to select a fertile mate. So those who in our evolutionary past who selected infertile mates, so postmen pas women, for example, did not become our ancestors. So we are all the descendants of this long and unbroken chain of ancestors who, all of whom succeeded in selecting a fertile mate. But fertility cannot be observed directlycuse exactly? And and ther are cus that are probablistically related to this underlying quality of fertility that we can't observe directly.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#4243-why-women-have-affairs><h3 id=4243-why-women-have-affairs><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[42:43] Why Women Have Affairs?</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/1e0c25b6-482a-4040-a767-ac23ea13eb33 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (41:13 - 42:49)</a>

There are a lot of things that will modulate your state of focus, but they don't directly mediate your sense of focus. So for instance, if right now a fire alarm went off in this building, it would modulate our attention, we would get up and leave. It would be very hard to do what we're doing with at banging in the background, least at first. So it's modulating focus, but it's not really involved in the mechanisms of focus. Right? In the same way, being well rested when you sleep, your autonomic nervous system that adjusts states of alertness and focus and calm works better than when you're sleep deprived. So if you're sleeping better, you're going to focus better. So i always answer this way to a question like because the best thing that anyone can do for their mental health, physical health and performance in athletic or cognitive endeavors or creative endeavors, is to make sure that you're getting enough quality sleep, enough of the time for you. And that's going to differ. We could talk about what that means now, in terms of things that mediate focus, without getting inte description of mechanisms, cause we have podcasts about that. It's very clear that mental focus follows visual focus, provided you're a sighted person. Much of the training that's being done now in china to teach kids to focus better literally has them stare at a target, blinking ever so often. But really training themselves, to breathe calmly and maintain a tight visual aperture. When you read, you have to maintain a tight visual aperture. You're literally scrolling like a high lighter in your s eye, right? It's kind of obvious once you hear it. So for people to have problems focusing, sleep, well, learn to dilate and contract your visual field consciously. This can be done if you practise it a little bit. And then, as i said before, it is very hard to get into a state of focus like a step function immediately, like snapping your fingers. What you can do is you can pick any object, but ideally an object at roughly the same ae, placed it roughly the same distance to which you're going to do that work, and stare at it.

Squatting five times a week for five reps, meaning you're working pretty heavy, meaning you're close to failure, but not failure. For strength generally. What andy taught me is that people who are training mostly for strength can these low retype regimens frequently because most of the adaptation is neural. And because you're not pushing to failure, in most cases, you don't get that sore. And so it's the motor neurons getting the muscle fibres to contract more intensely or with more efficiency in other ways, that's leading to these strength gains. And this is why power lifters can train every day, or five a week, or four days a week. For hypertrophy. I learned from andy that the repetition range can be pretty broad. You think anywhere from six to 30 repetitions. You should do ten sets per muscle group per week, maybe even a bit more, to high volume, high volume. But you have to go to failure or beyond in order to growth. Why does it work at such a great range of repetitions? Well, there apparently are three ways that you stimulate hypertrophy, and maybe more. One is tissued, micro damage to the tissue. The other is through some sort of tension base changes in the molecular gene programms of cells that lead to protein synthesis that that are distinct from damage. Nd. The other are metabolic effects, like high repetition work of superfusion of the muscle with blood.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#025350-cold-showers-after-training><h3 id=025350-cold-showers-after-training><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[02:53:50] Cold Showers After Training</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/d0829f18-e85b-4a76-8bba-ff992917ae84 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 34secÔ∏è (02:53:17 - 02:53:52)</a>

This is the beautiful work of a woman named susanna soberg, who's a scandinavian. She published this paper last year in cell reports medicine. And so i call this the soberg principle, which is, if you're doing ice and heat for whatever reason, doesn't matter if you end on heat or cold. But if you're using cold specifically to stimulate an increase in metabolism. End with cold, that's the soberg principle.

But if you really want to stimulate the big increases in metabolism, you stand out there and you dry off with arms extended in open air. And as that water evaporates off you, it is really cold, but your body is forced to activate umber of the warming programmes related to metabolism. This is the beautiful work of a woman named susanna soberg, who's a scandinavian. She published this paper last year in cell reports medicine. And so i call this the soberg principle, which is, if you're doing ice and heat for whatever reason, doesn't matter if you end on heat or cold. But if you're using cold specifically to stimulate an increase in metabolism. End with cold, that's the soberg principle.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#030823-the-effects-of-hormones-on-sexual-development><h3 id=030823-the-effects-of-hormones-on-sexual-development><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[03:08:23] The Effects of Hormones on Sexual Development</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/3a55214e-cb1e-48ea-88ff-714698857424 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (03:06:30 - 03:08:20)</a>

So just as a quick mention of something a lot of people take, s s ares or antidepressents that can disrupt sexual function.

Know how to calm yourself down. Don't expect looking to anything external to soothe yourself, as it puts you in a terrible position to be a caretaker of yourself and other people, right? So learn how to self soothe, right? Learn how to calm your mind, steady your action, steady your voice. There are tools to do that. We talk about in the podcast, but elsewhere, have that in place. I also think that if if your main focus is on you want to have good boundaries, et cetera, but on tending to the relationship, doing a little bit more than you think you ought to do, if everyone does that, it goes great. And i'm sometimes so positively struck by how supported i feel am, because for many years i ave just con doing everything on my own. So any little thing on my homey gooness, this feels huge. A and also, i think the dynamics have to be right. Let's, let's be really honest. This is a little bit of a tricky topic, but, um, there is a power dynamic in relationships. Sometimes not all, but in some elationships, it works much better if one person leads and the other person follows. In other relationships, it's more mutuality works best. People need to know what they need. And so knowing what you need and what you crave is really important. And then once you do that, you can create the relationship you want. I've seen that over and over again. And people are different, um, but i think that am ultimately imean, right? It's, it's, there's the dopomine phase of a relationship, then there's the seratonian phase, the kind of more mutuality, cosiness and sweetness. There's a great book about how to make sure that the dopomine component and the seratonan component, so to speak, go on forever. And it has to do with you know, when you first meet some one, n yor attracted to them, you're essentially objectifying them. O meaning, not the way people might think.

So the, you know, in some cultures, men and women will only touch for two weeks out of the month, and then for the other two weeks, the excitement and the sensuality andal the sexuality is very heightened. And then they go back to kind of distancing. Now, i don't think that's feasible for most people. But if you look statistically, those relationships tend to last a very long time, with at least reported mutual feelings of intense attraction for many, many, many decades. So human beings need to learn how to at least understand and control these dynamics.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#032554-external-challenge-helping-relationships><h3 id=032554-external-challenge-helping-relationships><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[03:25:54] External Challenge Helping Relationships</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/7846f2fe-5427-4096-b145-ddc0588e60ad rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (03:24:50 - 03:25:54)</a>

A state which is alined with the interests of some specific religion, race or an even smaller oligarchic group, can preside over and perpetrate the killing of billions of people and still come out ahead with respect to its narrow interests. The history of government gives no evidence that alignment with decreasing global catastrophic risk is stable. By contrast, there is evidence that alignment with the interests of some powerful subset of constituents is essentially the default condition of government. Bostrum is right that minimizing existential risk requires a stable and powerful global government, then politicide, propaganda, genicide, scapegoading and stagnation are all instrumental in pursuing the strategy of minimizing anthropogenic risk. A global state with this goal is therefore itself a catastrophic risk if it disarmed. Other more dangerous risks. Such a state could an antidote, but whether it would do so isn't obvious. In the next section, we consider whether the ponopticon government is likely to disarm many existential risks. Global surveillance states have strong incentives to develop dangerous technologies to guarantee authority over humanity's dangerous technological development. The global surveillance state will try to keep their technology level as high as possible relative to their constituents. We saw above, one part of their strategy enforcing technological stagnation. This alone may not be sufficient. However, the state may benefit from using technology to increase its capacity for longevity and control.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#4938-black-ball><h3 id=4938-black-ball><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[49:38] Black Ball</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/c2493185-2e9b-4e12-935c-87bbcf6fef72 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (48:04 - 49:39)</a>

I think myself that historical parallels and like historical precedents, can be used as rather a blunt instrument. Certainly, there was a feeling among radical politicians, nationalist politicians in ireland and black politicians in the united states that they had a certain common cause. There is also the overwhelming fact, and this, i think, is very relevant to douglas, that the great leader of catholic ireland, who brought about the so called emancipation of catholics when they were finally allowed to sit in parliament in 18 29. This great leader, daniel connell, was a very passionate anti slaver and abolitionist. And many of the people in his catholic movement, and then his movement to repeal the union with britain and ireland, felt the same way. He was a great radical in the cosmic sense of radical politics. Daniel o'connell, as well as being founder of catholic freedoms and an avataur of national autonomy, what do you think douglas learned in ireland? I suspect that douglas, who was a subtle and clever politician, learned that the parallels between what seemed to be the oppression of the native irish and the very real oppression of blacks in the united states were not exactly commensurate to each other. The extent to which he absolutely noted that isn't proven, but i feel that, and here iam chancing my arm, rather that any one as analytical as he would have seen that what irish natives suffered under in mid nineteenth century ireland was nothing like what black slaves suffered under in mid nineteenth century america.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#4204-is-ireland-a-country-of-utopian-theorists><h3 id=4204-is-ireland-a-country-of-utopian-theorists><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[42:04] Is Ireland a Country of Utopian Theorists?</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/88ca17c0-1429-4a2c-8a0b-6c32275c2157 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 54secÔ∏è (41:10 - 42:05)</a>

I think if you look at modern irish fiction, which is very often a barometer of how a country thinks about itself, in the early decades of irish independence, let's say, of the twenties and thirties, you had the short stories of shone filon, mary laven, frank o'connor. And you had a kind of, not utopian, but often rather idealized o often quite a bitter view of irish, especially rural life as well. But certainly a sense of specialness and removed ness and a celebration of a certain kind of irish identity. This is, i think, true of many lesser known writers as well.

My problem will cause total human extinction. I think there could possibly be a bit of when you start working on something that becomes your whole world, you start thinking about the issues and problems, and you can at some point lose objectivity you are so integrated into fixing that problem or issue. For example, medical students often think they have some of the eases they are studying. It might become more real because you are thinking about it all the time. I wonder if that results in biasing people to place a lot of emphasis on it possible solution. Maybe putting more emphasis on adjacent areas like explainability, there might be more opportunities there. I believe this a i issue is becoming important within a because we are all driven by our emotions. It feels plausible that we get wiped out fear. And also, you get a lot of status by working on this problem. I sense that is why everyone is moved to work on this problem. It seems like a great thing to work on. And then everyone uses their intelligence to justify what they are doing, which is to work on problem, because what else do you work on? It's a really cool problem to work on.

We still have to prioritize. I believe there are quite many existential risks. Then, of course, you get to the point where you only have a limited amount of resources. And it looks like over the next year's the resources be more and more limited, considering we are on the brink of an economic crisis. So when you have limited amount of resources, even if we theoretically think it's worth spending enormous amount of resources to solve a safety then we still have to do the trade offs with other risks at some point. I think it has been exaggerated. It is important to me to make sure when we give attention to a i we should not ignore other risks that have the potential of shaping our civilization in the wrong direction. We need a better theory of change. I haven't seen a clear theory of change for how this kind of work would actually reduce a i risk.

One way or another, advanced a is likely to have a large impact on the values that steer humanity's future. So far in human history, it seems like the future has largely been determined by competitive pressures, rather than by deliberate attempts by humans to shape the future according to their values. That is, if some technical in tutional or cultural innovation offers a competitive advantage, then its proliferation is highly likely. Some examples include firearms. In the tokagawa period of japanese history, up until 18 53, firearms technology was largely eliminated in japan, and a samurai dominated social order persisted for over 200 years. But then, in order to repel the threat of western colonization, japan was forced to re adopt firearms, along with other western customs and institutions, despite this running contrary to the values of the japanese elite.

But if you do that with a film from two thousand and five and a film from two thousand and 20, again, sort of an obscure film where you don't recognize the actors, you're just looking at it aesthetically, and trying to deduce which one came first and which one came second, it's almost impossible. And this phenomenon just seems to almost be infiltrating every aspect of the culture, this idea that everything, to a degree now, is somewhat retro and that certain kind of natural evolutions that happened because culture was lost or a sort of forgotten, or just kind of moved beyond which doesn't really happen now.

And not all languages, or most, don't have that advantage, so we can play with the different vocabularies, and you don't speak more plainly or speak more abstractly and intellectually, we have that great facility because of our vocabulary.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br><br>As a translator, why do you think that film sub titles are so often so bad?

So on the bitter sweet side of things, the wisdom that i would give is that, especially for kids who are growing up in relative comfort with everything going pretty lem, they get the idea that real life is when things are going well, and when things don't go well, it's like a detour from the main road, as opposed to understanding that it's all the main road. M and i tell the story book of this time that we went on this family vacation where we rented a house in the countryside. And the house was next to this field where where lived two donkeys that our kids fell in love withand they were like really little at the time, two boys, and they're spending all this time feeding carrots to the donkeys, and it's all beautiful. And then comes the day wher they realize that we're leaving, and like two days, and they're never going to see these donkeys again. And they start crying themselves to sleep. And the usual things that parents might say at a moment like that, like, you know, maybe we'll come back, or another family will feed em, we'll feed these donkeys, none of that made any difference. But when we said to them, you know, good bye is part of life, and this this feeling you're having, everybody has it. You've had it before. You're goig to have it again. You'll feel better in a couple of days. Am, but this is the way it's supposed to be. This is natural. That's when they stopped crying, because i think that's when they stopped resisting. Yo. Like, it's one thing to feel the pain of good bye, and it's another thing to be feeling like this isn't supposed to be happening. It's the resistance part of this isn't supposed to be happening that makes life really difficult.

It's a little box, and there're a series of lights arranged in a semicircle at the top of the box. And then there's a home button that you press. And when one of the lights goes on, there's a button next to each of those lights. You take your finger off the home button, and you just press the button next to the light that goes on. And so it's a very simple reaction. Time light goes on, as quick as you can, you press the button and you get a reaction time from the moment you lift your finger off the button to when you press the button with where the light is. That reaction time doesn't really correlate with icue very much. But if you change the instructions and you say, three lights are going to come on simultaneously. I want you to press the button next to the light that's furthest from the other two. So maybe lights one and two go on and light six goes on simultaneously. You take your finger off, and you would press the button by light six. That's that reaction time to a more complex task. It's not really hard. Almost everybody gets it, all right?

First, is it effect on the 50 % of the variants that's the g factor, or on the other 50 %? And there is evidence that it is a g factor effect. And second, what on earth causes this? And doesn't this mean intelligence and g factor cannot be genetic because the scale of natural selection is much, much longer than a couple of decades ago. And so it's been used to try to undermine the idea that there can be genetic influence on intelligence. But certainly it can be. The flin effect can affect the non genetic aspects of intelligence, because jeans account for maybe 50 % of the variants. Maybe higher, could be as high as 80 % for adults, but that's just say 50 % for discussion. Ah, so the flinn effects, it's still a mysterys. Still a mystery. Its still a mystery, although the evidence is coming out. I told you before, i edited a journal on intelligence, and we're doing a special issue in honor of james flynn. So i'm starting to see papers now in really the latest research on this a.

And is at the first part of the brain to turn on when consciousness is regained. And i was working with an anesthesiologist named mike alkir, who was really brilliant at this. These were really the first studies of a brain imaging a using positronmission tomography, long before a f mri. And you would inject a radioactive sugar that labelled the brain. And the harder the brain was working, the more sugar it would take up, and then you could make a picture of glucose use in the brain. And we he, he was amazing.

And it was even brilliant at this. And, and what we did is, we had these normal volunteers come in on three occasions. On one occasion, he gave them enough anaesthetic drug so they were a little drowsy. And on another occasion, they came in and he fully anatmotized them. And, you know, he would say, you know, mike, an, can you hear me? And the person would say, a yees. And then though we would scan people under and under no anaesthetic conditions, the same person.

Because if someone's gone to graduate school, that tells you something. You can make some inference, as supposed to someone who didn't graduate high school? O can we do a chart review? And he says, no, thy they never really put down the exact dose. And no, he said, no. So to this day, that the the simple question, does it take more anaesthetic drug to put someone under if they have a high e cue? Or less or less? It could go either way beause, by the way, our early petskin studies of intelligence found the unexpected result of an inverse correlation between glucose metabolic rate and intelligence. It wasn't how much a brain area lit up. How much it lit up was negatively correlated to how well it did on the test. Which led to the brain efficiency hypothesis, which is still being studied to day.

And he's just started this business. He's put up a sign around town. It's very unthropinertial for him. Doesn't have much to do with himself other than art. And she shows up at the doorway, and it lasts about 30 seconds. There's incredible tension in that scene, romantic and sexual tension. And it's because they can't, they're not going to do anything, and they're good actors. And so it's a very powerful scene. I've also argued, i think part of the appeal of that show, there's a sert f anthropological voiarism. Here's a culture in a community that's very alien to most people, you know, including modern orthodox jews. Tat's a very different form of religious judaism to the ultra orthodox that they're portraying in that show. And, you know, part of the charm of the show is that, all, theyhave the same problems we do. You know, theyhave trouble with their kids. They're not ture, you know, where theyr gong to make a living. And so that's part of the charm. But i think the other part of the charm is what you're talking about. There's a certain old fashionedness there that people may not want to live that way themsel sbut they like watching it the way they're like reading a jane austen novel, where the mores of romance are long gone in the past. And there's a certain innocence, i think, to the characters in stesel, which makes it so deeply appealing. The only other observation i want to make, which i think is so vastithing to me, is it's a show about ultra religious, ultra orthodox jews. Salmhot's no judaism in the show. You know, they murmur and mutter blessings under their breath, but there's no glorification of, say, the religious experience of the chabot. And they don't make fun of it either. There's no mocking of it or of the attitudes. They're just taken as they are. And i think that was a genius moved by the creators to make that show the way it is, which is really nor is hardest for you to deal with. Negotiation is challenging. I think it's prealy hard for my wife, who likes set prices. Te lot of prices here are just kind of suggestions. They're an invitation to negotiate. And there are a few settings in america where that's normal. You buy a house or car, you don't expect to pay liss price, but you do expect to pay list price four say, a hair cut, or, i don't know, a repair or something. But at lot of times the price they announce is just like a hint, a suggestion. And it's very hard for americans to respond to that. If you come here and you get off the plane and you get in a cab, i don't tepryand this happens in america, riht prices in americaor in a cab off the meter, are often negotiated.

Jerusalem tends to be a more religious city than televieve. But there're plenty of orthodox people and religious people in televieve, and there's plenty of non observant people here in jerusalem.

And then when we got to know each other better, i found that the western rituals of the dating scene were often much more patriarchal than anything i'd experienced.

Actually, the data tells you, and this is well documented, both within india and in a recent survey that was released by pew, that though the rate of growth is higher among moslems definitely than it is among hindoo communities, the rate of decline is also now the sharpest, because, you know, there was a higher, much higher rate of growth among moslems, and that the moslems will never outnumber hindus. But would i take that to take your question for there being a a sort of lack of enthusiasm for child rearing? Not true. This has been ad is old fight to get india's population under control, and it is finally starting to yield results. Which is why i actually disagree with legislations that are now being proposed in several parts of india to actually either incentivize or penalize those who have more than two children. I think penalties don't necessarily work. Incentives can, but penalties certainly don't.

And i think that one of the biggest reasons for the worsening relations, or the othering, as it were, of communities that are not your own, is the gatalization of how people live. So for example, you know, if there were neighbourhoods where people live cheek by jowl, that still happens, of course, in many cities, but it also happens less than it used to. And that is true. We are seeing a kind of moslem quarter, and, to give an example, or a christian quarter, in a way that we wouldn't have before our cities were so getized. And i think that ind of intermingling, of living in the same housing societies or neighborhoods, participating in each other's festivals, asd the postagus tolerating them. Those are the structural changes or shifts that we are witnessing. It's also true that it is tougher for a person from a religious minority, in particular, an indian moslem, to get a house as easily as a non muslem. And i think i would be lying if i did not acknowledge that. And also, the last point is of inter faith marriages, or interfaith love. This is a deeply politicized issue as well. While i am talking to you, in the last 24 hours, in the southern city of hydrobart, one of our big musard of technology hubs, we've had reports of a moslem family that attacked a hindu man for marrying a moslem woman. And in reverse, we see moslem women also targeted all the time if they choose to marry hindus. This is not helped by the fact that you've had several states now talking about what they call love jihad. That's the phrase they use for marriages that are across religious communities. In particular, between hindus and moslems. The percentage of people indians marrying, not just outside their religion, but also outside their caste, which in hindus, is a kind of hierarchical system of traditional occupation that you are born into, is woefully low.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#1825-the-gang-rape-of-a-galit-woman><h3 id=1825-the-gang-rape-of-a-galit-woman><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[18:25] The Gang Rape of a Galit Woman</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/69916ae0-3fce-4896-a63c-8940d298f07b rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (16:43 - 18:27)</a>

And i really did know. My parents had never told me what my cast was, and it was their sort of way of bringing me up to be a progressive indian. And then many decades, not even many decades later, a few years later, i did one of my first journalism stories in the gang rape of a galit woman in a village in rajastan. The dullets are the people who are at the very bottom of the social hierarchy. They are often treated as outcasts.

I think the thing about this country, and in some ways, an unlikely country, in terms of not having a singular organizing principle to it, in terms of religion or language, just an abroad idea it is so diverse. The best thing about us is our diversity. And that diversity is reflected in food. I mean, i haven't eaten so many quisines within my country, and i'm 50, and i have it. And it would take a lifetime for people to get to know indian food. And i think the biggest reas that it's so interesting is, one, because there isn't one thing called indian food. There isn't one kind of indian food. But mostly because of flavour and spices. The one thing we can ever be accused of is being blanda neither our food nor our people. And there's a lot of, sort of, obviously, experimentation with spice and with vor and the palateis just now, i don't know, become that there's no notion of ever having a meal that is not flavorful or full of aromas and spices.

Let's how you pick up your phone to check your email, and at that moment, your five year old daughter starts telling you a story. Now several things are possible. You could so lost in your thoughts about your email, and you could find the urge to respond to it so compelling that you don't even notice that your daughter is talking to you. Or you could notice it only to rebuff her in a way that makes her feel terrible. And you might be so entranced that five minutes later, you wouldn't even recall that this episode occurred. That's how most people live their lives. In fact, that's how most of us live most of our lives even after we learn to meditate. But the more you train in this practice, the more degrees of freedom you'll find. In situations like this. You can notice, for instance, that your daughter's trying to get your attention, and that giving her your attention is in competition with your following this urge to check your email. And when actual mindfulness comes on line, you can feel the urge to check your email as a pattern of energy in your body and simply let it go. That is, you can actually break the link between the feeling and the behavior imperative it seems to communicate.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#top-tips-to-help-aspiring-developers-find-a-recruiter><h1 id=top-tips-to-help-aspiring-developers-find-a-recruiter><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>TOP Tips To Help Aspiring Developers Find A Recruiter</h1></a><p><img src="https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.buzzsprout.com%2Fvariants%2Fnhiqyu5x0lfmlauwz4pdsnxtpyct%2F70306cab02134d02858e9408b4d8ac5d96bb9bd1ef87bf980ff0baf9f8861cb2.jpeg&w=200&h=200" width=200 alt=Cover|200></p><a href=#snips-33><h2 id=snips-33><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Snips</h2></a><a href=#2332-do-you-feel-like-it-is-a-developers-market><h3 id=2332-do-you-feel-like-it-is-a-developers-market><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[23:32] Do You Feel Like It Is A Developers Market?</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/dcc286d0-d500-4292-82e0-cd782d0eea8c rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (22:14 - 23:36)</a>

That's not something that i've thought of before, and it's simply because i've overlooked it. But it makes sense. Because my sister, who's reasonably fit, i'm always trying to get her to do a bit more. She always asks me, what should i take? And i believe her in supplements for certain people in certain instances. But i keep telling her, you know, the behaviours are going to ande. Nutrition are ging to have the greatest outsize, possitive effect. And she loves things like um dance classe and things, or kick boxing, these counds of things, which so it make sense that if you can hook somebody on the conditioning aspect or the skill aspect, and can't trick them into doing more cardio, so to speak, that that's terrific. Also, the neuro scientist in me just has to say, forgive me a that any time you're engaging the ouow tha two sets of motor narons, the ones in your brain, the upper motor rons, and the ones in your spinal cord. Any time you're engaging those upper motor nerons, which are for deliberate, well controlled action, you're doing a great thing for your brain in terms of brain longevity. So i now i need to incorporate some actual skills in my training. Am going back to t training a bit. One of the most important things i learned from you over the years was that when training to increase muscle size, to really think not so much about moving weights, but more about challenging muscles.

You know, its isthat. It's, your muscles prefer to sort of yo ratchet their way down into that that contraction, and then you maintain that that that more comfortable length tension relationship. So when you're sleeping, it tends to you on the side of shorter rather than longer. When an ideall, we don't really want that. We want to maintain as much of that length, because with more length, we actually have more leverage, right? That muscle has more leverage to contract if it was all the way contracted. Yeu really can't ois weu know, generate much force in a muscle that's already maximumly contracted.

Well, there is, maybe there is some adaptability because it's so floppy. But at the same time, at some point, that critical juncture when you're going to then step through and you need to be able to push off, the foot has to actually change in the mid foot itself to become a rigid lever, as they call it. You're going from a mobile adaptor to a rigid lever. That rigid lever literally locks up the mid tarsal joint to come solid so that you can push off it with leverage.

I think i learn this from you also. If you stand up straight, and then you just point your thumbs out. Am, like a, like a thumb's up, but you're just pointed. Your hands are down your you point your thumbs straight out. Ideally they would go straight outmost people, the thumbs aen't be pointing toward one another, because most people are starting to look somewhere between a a, a non um human primate um and a melted candle um, you know, bent at the hips, et cetera, from too much sitting. We're all sitting. Were in inward rotation, but i learn from you that the upright road compromises some important aspects of our shoulder mechanics. And cabea a sort of dangerous movement in some ways. I'm sure there's a safe way for people to do it. But so i've always made it a point now, on the basis of this advice, to not do upright roas but in doing them before, but to really strive for a external rotation on things like bench tips, on, on a number of different things. Whenever i can, i try and go into external rotation, provided without looking like an idiot, walked round with my palms facing outward. Please tell us about internal external rotation. A, the upright is one aspect of that.

I didn't want to take medication. I want do back surgery a in the end, turns out it wasn't back jury at all. And one of the things that helped fix it was this, just learning about this thing called the medial glute. And you had a video that said, fix back pain.

The ankle is the wrist, the foot is the hand, like there, there they funk the knees, the elbow, their two hinge joints. They function that way well. With the shoulder, you've got that mobility that comes from having all that freedom of motion, but the stability is lacking. Well, the same thing with the hip. Like, you've got mobility, but if you don't fully stabilize it by training all the muscles of the hip, and if you don't strengthen the external rotation of the hip, then, you know, youe, you're going to have issues. I di not bile mechanically going to work the same way. If you think of the body as a series of bands pulling in different directions at different levels of tension, you know, you're being pulled into one direction or the other, just by the balance of tension, from one weak area to one dominantly tight area.

People that are chronic ankle sprainers are almost always going to wind up having back pain, because the ankle sprain causes weakness and maladaptations in the ankle that then gets connected through the chain. Because now, once i distort the ankle on the shin, now the knee is trying to maintain its ability to hinge smoothly, so it torks on the femur to do that, while the femer's now inside the hip joint pulling on the pelvis, and the pelvis is ot of whack.

I'm going to just devote that portion of the plate to the starchy carbohydrate. And so it gives me a little bit more responsibility in terms of portion control. Cause those are the foods a, again, probably younow, don't mean driven, that are most easily overeaten. I always asked the question, how it was the last time you ate ten chicken breasts at a meal, like you're getting sick of it after maybe two or three. But you could eat a whole hel of a lot of carbohydrate, starching carbohydrates, because t they're just so satisfying. And i think those triggers, as you said, they want more. Like that's what happens, right? You just keep even when you're feeling full, you want more. Ah, and that's the biggest danger to carbohydrate. So if you can develop some sort of discipline around them, a, then you can still enjoy them. If you can't develop that discipline a, for whatever reason, then maybe they do become something that you have to work yourself around or adopt. The differnt eting style.

This patirla opinion. And if you listen to thi show, i think you'lve see in overtime that i don't have very much respect for the supreme court. And it's because of opinions like citizens united were i read them an realize they're doing what i do, just worse. They're just running crappy punditry. So you ere talking about kennedy's views there of whether corruption can be addressed. But kennedy goes further. He talks about whether or not corruption is present. He he makes as cor his inion, like an actual view, about whether or not political contributions of this kind will either create real corruption or the appearance of it. Because he agrees on some level that there is an interest in reducing corruption and the appearance of it. So he he writes, we now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. He goes on to say, the fact that speakers, by which he means here donors, may have influence over or access to elected officials, does not mean that these officials are corrupt. Then he goes on to say, the appear rence of influence or access furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy. And i don't understand how you can see that is anything but punditry. I mean, bad punditry. I would be embarrassed to make that argument. But nevertheless, it is a crucial decision that is not, in any way that i can tell, truly illegal decision. Much like john roberts decides racism isn't that bad any more, justice kennedy decides political corruption isn't that bad any more. And what is so weird about it to me is, if you would imagine that there would be anywhere in the world, in the law that you would obviously defer to elected politicians on what is going on here, it would be on the question of whether or not unlimited independent campaign contributions lead to corruption, or the appearance of corruption in political practice. And kennidy decides he knows better than te no elof sight.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#299--demis-hassabis-deepmind><h1 id=299--demis-hassabis-deepmind><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>#299 ‚Äì Demis Hassabis: DeepMind</h1></a><p><img src="https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flexfridman.com%2Fwordpress%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fpowerpress%2Fartwork_3000-230.png&w=200&h=200" width=200 alt=Cover|200></p><a href=#snips-40><h2 id=snips-40><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Snips</h2></a><a href=#3016-what-makes-chess-so-compelling><h3 id=3016-what-makes-chess-so-compelling><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[30:16] What Makes Chess So Compelling?</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/f4d27313-d52a-4174-8f5f-1646259ca2d4 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (28:49 - 30:16)</a>

And i think one of the reasons, and you know, i love philosophy, and philosophy of mind, is we've found, i difficulties. There haven't been the tools for us to really, other than introspection, two fromvery clever people in history, very clever philosophers, to really investigate this scientifically. But now, suddenly we have a pelethro of tools. First, we have all the newer science tools, from u machine, single cell recording, all this stuff. But we also have the ability, computers and a i, to build or intelligence systems. So i think that er, you know, i think it is amazing what the human mind does. And er, and, and i'm kind of in awe of it, really. And er, and i think it's amazing that with our human minds we're able to build things like computers and and a even you now think and investigate about these questions. I think that's also testament the human mind.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br><br>Yes, the universe built the human mind that now is building computers that help us understand both the universe and our own human mind, right?</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br><br>Its lictly it.

Well, for sure. I mean, you know, maybe we should talk about the origins of life too. But proteins themselves, i think, are magical and incredible. A a, as i said, little little bionana machines and ar and, and actually, leventa, who is another scientist, a contemporary of amvinson a, he, he coined this, leventa, what became known as leventa's paradox, which is exactly what you're saying. He calculated roughly a prot an, average protein, which is maybe two thousand amino acids, a bases long. Is a is is can fold in maybe ten to the power 300 different confirmations. So thes ten to the power 300 different ways that protein could fold up. And yet, somehow, in nature, physics solves this, solves this in a matter of miller seconds. So proteins fold up in your body in, you know, sometimes in in fractions of a second. Sophysics is somehow solving that search problem.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br><br>And just to be clear, in many of these cases may be correctny fom wrong.

But yes, most of the time it's a unique mapping. And that unique mapping is not obvious.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br><br>No, exactly. I shoul see what the problem is, exactly. So there's a unique mapping, usually in healthy if it's healthy.

And you can get nerty on that and realize that it's just so many orders of magnitude more in all ways. If you ask how much compute per second get, or if you ask how how possible it is to go travel to other galaxies, or basic any actes you're excited about, we're nowhere near the limits that the laws of physics place the speed of light, that you can't be stuff like that.

Rob people are really all over the place, even very educated people. And there are these two basic dimensions you outline first the question of, well, how soon and will this happen, and how far will it go? Where you'll have some people like my former m i t colleague, professor rodney brooks, who says it's not going to happen for 300 years, ther we'll even to human level, and a hundred % sure. And then you have other people, which aren't actually most people in the technical community now, who think tits can happen a lot sooner. And recent poles of ai researchers tend to predict that ao decades from now, we'll have a that can do basically all our human jobs, or cheaper than we can. That that's one axis where you can basicaly classify people from techno sceptics to think it's never going to work, to techno optimists. And then on the other axis, it's do they think this is going to suck, or going to be great? Where maybe it actually says more about peoples personality traits and whether than than anything scientific, really where they land on that. Some people tend to becone of hopeful and optimistic about everything. Some people are more prone to wishful thinking than others. If we take the first one, the question of what will actually happen, i think a very common misconception, specially among scientists, is that intelligence is something mysterious that can only exist inside of biological organisms like human beings and te if we've learned anything from physics, it's that the no, intelligence is about information processing. And it really doesn't ter whether the information is processed by a carbon atom, by carbon atoms in neurons in brains, in people, or by silican atoms in some g pu somewhere. It's the information processing itself that matters. It's this sub straight independent nature information processing t hat doesn't matter whether it's a mack or a pc you're running it on, or linnox box, or for that matter, what the cpu manufacture is, or even whether it's biological or silican base that matters. It's just the information processing that matters. That's really been the number one corps idea. I would say, that that's caused the tion at nai, that you can keep swabping up out your hardware and using the same alegarithms.

It's identical in canada and the u. K. Australian new zealand are very similar there, ust after a little delay. So whatever we're looking for here, but yet, it's not, it's not as clear in the germanic countries. In continental europe, it's little different. And we can get into that when we talk about childhood. But something's happening in many countries a that. And it started right around 20 12, 20 13. It wasn't gradual. A, it hit girls hardest, and it hit preteen girls the hardest. So what could it be? Nobody has come up with another explanation. Nobody. It wasn't the financial crisis, that wouldn't hit preteen girls the hardest. A, there is no other explanation. The complexity here. And the data is, of course, as everyone knows, correlation doesn't prove causation. The fact that television viewing was going up in the fifties and or in the sixties and seventies doesn't mean that that was the cause of the crime. So what i've done a, and this is work with jean twang, who wrote the book, igen is ah. Because i was challenged you know, one nigt. When gregg and i put out the book, the coddling themerican mind, some researchers challenged us and said, oh, you do't nowha.

And so, for example, the c i a and american government wanted to bring down the soviet union.

Certainly they weren't holding george washington and the other founding fathers fully accountable in the years running up to the revolution. And what's interesting, and many historians have noted, is that most of the founding fathers had a big economic stake in independence, or a very particular lena, trade and an tax policy with britain. It's no coincidence. And coincident, a lot of the people who remained loyalists had economic stakes in union with britain and with the british policies that britain wanted to impose on the united states. And so that surely influenced, along with all the other more noble motives that played a role, both in their willingness to launch the revolution, but had also played a role his.

So the ucranians refuse to compromise on their liberty. The american revolutionaries refuse to compromise on their liberty. And the tolibon refused to compromise, not so much on their liberty, but on a set of principles. The american administration, when dealing with the tolybon refused to compromise on a certain set of principles of justice and of a punishment of a grave crime.

Basically, if you have two actors, and one is quickly becoming more powerful than the other, then the rising party would probably like to commit to not take too much of the pie, to not exploit the other party in future, because that would stop them from being attacked now. But no matter, no matter what they say, the declining power knows that it's going to be in the rising power's interest to take advantage of them in future. And so now the rising power could basically try to directly pay off the declining power now yeout to attack them, which which does apparently often happen.

There's lots of oligarchs, there's lots of military generals, there's lots of powerful governors as but they were never banded together to collectively resist him. And so he was able to sort of divide and conquer. And so that's the stratage that works well for him. And now there is an alliance, the nativ alliance, plus ukraine, that is drawing a line, sort of, right? You know, the natives is really drawing that firm a line. They're supporting ukrane. They're not actually allies. They're not militarily getting involved. So you can understand maybe the westw ess to fuel this war on those terms.

Glad to see you go. On the other hand, that is an incentive for him to just keep fighting beyond where it makes any sense, whatever.

In the casea, it goes back to this broader point about over centralized power being the root of accentuating all five kinds of conflict bicas mechanically is going to make leaders more inchecked and less likely internalized cost. But it means we're at the mercy of their misreceptions. We're at the mercy of their intangible incentives. There's more uncertainty. They can't commit, and so it just aggravates all thes arches of war. And i think that is, to me, a very plausible rational for why checked, highly checked and balanced societies very seldom go to war against any one, against one another. And when they do go to war, it's usually against a relatively unchecked society where they can't find a mutual bargaining range. But i'm careful to sort of talk in the book about these sort of checked and balance societies, rather democratic, because democratic people think t means, you know, most people s leap to thinking as the is the president elected or not? But then there's a lot of countries like liberia where wo're electing a dictator every five years. That's a slight exaggeration, but they're just not, they're not that checkd and balance. They have a lot of autonomy and and so an election for the executive is actually not the most important check for my prorspective for peace building. It's actually the division of power within the country, across branch os tho government, across levels of government in the country, anto these like supernational organizations. So anything that does that is going to make things more peaceable. So i totally by democratic peace theory.

There's a certain breathing, a certain movement in our body. Depression and sadness is something we do. We're more hunched over. Our breathing is more shallow, right? And so there's a correlation between the way you move your body and your emotions. There directly. This is even before we get to dopamen hits and our nervous system being. I'm just telling you that the way you move your body is an emotion. You do emotions. And so when you move your body, you can't be in full workout mode, moving your body, running, king, jumping jacks, jump rope, and be depressed. They don't go together simultines because your body doesn't get the connectionn i'm moving like i'm joyful. I'm moving like i'm having sex. I'm moving like i'm happy. These are all joyful states.

Once that temperature is set at a certain degree, everything in the world, externally, can hit it. And you will find a way to get that temperature. So even in this house, let's say it's set at 80 degrees, if we opened up all the doors in cold air, just the worst things in life, the blizzard of life, came in, the thermostat will kick the heater and will regulate this room back to 80 degrees. The reverse is also true. It's a super hot day. Great things are happening in your life. It's getting hotter and hotter and hotter. If you're at 80 degrees, that internal therm stet will find a way, over a window of time, to cool your life right back down to 80 degrees again. So the key, the secret key, is to be able to shift that identity 90, a hundred, hundred, ad 20. So some of the way strategies to do that are very simple.

Because what happened is, there was maybe, at that point in time, i was a heavy palm trio user, there was maybe a couple million smart phone users in the united states. What the iphone did is made everyone a smart phone user. And so there is all send a whole bunch of new entrance. And in overtime, it also canibalized the existing smart phone market. Ah, so a lot of times people may sort of mistake you for incumbents when you're crning entirely new market. So the next is on building a remarkable product. So what does this process look like? Ad, i'lltry break it down into very literal steps about exactly what you should be doing. Ah, so everyone knows this, right? Step one, have a great idea. Step two talks customers. Step three, something happens there. And step four, profit. Right? Everyone knows his. But what is step three, right? Cause that's where everyone's plodding around in the desert, like, trying to figure out what the hell to do, and nothing's working. So let's talk about step three.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br><br>So step three is literally this list of things.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br><br>So you talk to customers and develop a market thesis. Try to understand exactly what their pain point is. What's that job they're trying to get done, and how can you help them get it done faster or better?

In eununumerator, the numerators based on last year's denominator.

And that's cohort base. So i like renewal rates a lot better. All right, a next a metrick that aren't included. So number one metrick that is not included is sign ups. This is something that was not very well understood when we got started. I would not pay that much attention to sign ups. I would pay a lot of attention to active users. U if you have good returning usage, and sign ups translates the active users pretty well. If you have bad returning usage, then sign up basically like completely drops off, and you have very little active users. In fact, that number may even be shrinking, even when your stiamps are growing, if people aren't returning. A number two, conversion rate. If if you're thinking of building a sas business, conversion rates, they all start low. They build over time. I wouldn't pay a lot of attention to conversion rate in the beginning. I'd pay attention to some of the other metrics. A, i think it's the last point. Just how does it feel when you get product market fit? Ah, you'll know when you achieved it when your customers are beating a path to your door. A, when you don't have it, everything feels hard. It feels like you're pushing this huge rock up a mountain. You're a pushing your customers towards the solution. They're too nice to tell you no, but they're not really coming back. They're not really using it. When you have it, the whole world is beating a path to your door. Everyone wants to use it. Ah, pressis writing about it. Everything feels easy, and every decision you make feels like you're a genius, because they all go, well, ah, you know, t spoiler alert, it's somewhere in between. Ah, it turns out that, you know, as you're scaling your business overtime, you'll discover, ah, you're maybe a little less smart than you thought you were. Ah, but, but, but, that comes later. A but, i think this is what it feels like. So if you're not feeling that, you know, sort of, customers pulling you in a direction world, you know, beating a path to your door, then you probably don't have it yet.

In fact, many people that refer to themselves or others as obsessive or compulsive, or having o c d, or o c d about this, or o c d about that, do not have clinically diagnosil o c d. Rather, many people have obsessive compulsive personality disorder. However, there are many people in the world that have actual o c d. And for those people there is a tremendous amount of suffering. In fact, o c d turns out to be number seven on the list of most debilitating illnesses, not just psychiatric illnesses, but of all illnesses, which is remarkable and somewhat frightening.

People do not mind, or in fact, often invite or like the particular terns of thought that lead them to be compulsive along certain dimensions. So leaving aside obsessive compulsive personality disorder for the moment, let's focus a bit more on o c d and define how it tends to show up in the world. First of all, o c d is extremely common. In fact, current estimates are that anywhere from two point five % to as high as three or even four % of people suffer from true o c d. That is an astonishingly high number. Now the reason the range is so big, two point five % all the way up to three or maybe even four %, is that a lot of the features of o c d go unnoticed, both in the clinitions office and simply because people don't report it and don't talk about it. In fact, it is possible to have recurrent and intrusive obsessions and not engage in the sorts of behaviours that would ever allow people to notice that somebody has o c d.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#2602-anxiety-and-the-right-hand-turn><h3 id=2602-anxiety-and-the-right-hand-turn><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[26:02] Anxiety and the Right Hand Turn</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/c81c61c9-7b28-42b3-ba0e-96d4e8cda1da rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (24:33 - 26:01)</a>

But then by taking a right hand turn, again, in this one particular example, by taking a right hand turn, there is a very brief, i should mention, very brief, relief of that anxiety at the time of the decision to right, not left. And there's an additional drop in anxiety while one takes the right hand turn, as opposed to the left hand turn. And then, as i alluded to before, there's a reinforcement of the compulsion. In other words, by going right, it doesn't create a situation in thebr n and psychology of the person that, ah, you know what, i'm not anxious any more. Left would have probably been ok. It reinforces the idea that right made me feel better, or turning right made me feel better, and going left would have been that much worse. Again, it reinforces the obsession even further. And again, we could swap out right turns and left turns with something like hand washing. The feeling that something is contaminated and the need to wash one's hands, even though one already wash their hands 20, 30, 50 times prior nd were ae.

One of the powerful elements of treatment for o c d is to really support the patient and make them realize that thoughts are just thoughts, and that everyone has disturbing thoughts, and that oftentimes those disturbing thoughts arise at the most inconvenient and sometimes what seems like the most inappropriate circumstances.

Similarly, just calling someone obsessive is one thing.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#021753-obsessive-compulsive-personality-disorder><h3 id=021753-obsessive-compulsive-personality-disorder><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[02:17:53] Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/c81132a5-c4b6-4e46-872e-5a52e5b38ce2 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (02:16:20 - 02:17:53)</a>

They had compulsive behavior. So these are people that are suffering in their life because their compulsions are really strong. So it's not just being really knit picky or really orderly in one case, and having full blown oced in the other. Both sets of subjects are challenged in life because they are having relationship issues or job related issues, et cetera, because they are that compulsive. However, the individuals with obsessive compulsive personality disorder, they discounted the value of delayed gratifications significantly less than those with obsessive compulsive disorder. What do i mean? They are both impairing disorders that are marked by compulsive behaviours. Here iam paraphrasing, but they can be differentiated by the presence of obsessions in o c d. So obsessions in o cd, people with o c d are absolutely fixated on certain ideas, and those ideas are intrusive. Again, that's the hall mark theme. And by an excessive capacity to delay reward in obsessive compulsive personality disorder. That is, people who have excessive compulsive personality disorder are really good at delaying gratification. So they are able to concentrate very intensely and perform very intensely in ways that allow them to instil order such that they can delay rewards.

But i think it is fair to say that obcessive compulsive disorder, whether not in mild, moderate or severe form, is impairing normal functioning. Whereas opsessive compulsive personality disorder, there is a range of expressions of that, some of which can be adaptive, some of which can be maladaptive. And again, it's all going to depend on context. Before we conclude, i do want to touch on something that i think a lot of people experience, and that's superstitions. Superstitions are fascinating. And there's some fascinating research on superstitions. One particular study that i'm a big fan of is the work of benslevski at harvard. He studies motor sequences and motor learning. And he as beautiful data on how people learn, for instance, a tennis swing, and the patterns that they engage in early on, and then the patterns of swinging that they swing in the racket, that is, that they engage in later as they acquire more skill. And basically the take away is that the amount of error, or variation from swing to swing is dramatically reduced as they acquire skill. That's all fine and good, and there's some beautiful, a mechanistic data that he and others have discovered to support how that comes to be. But they also explore animal models, in particular, rats pressing sequences of buttons and levers to obtain a reward.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#022417-the-motor-sequence-of-pitchers><h3 id=022417-the-motor-sequence-of-pitchers><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[02:24:17] The Motor Sequence of Pitchers</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/81ad85c1-8bc7-4024-a1db-770a6a063fde rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (02:22:52 - 02:24:19)</a>

But if you watch closely, oftentimes there are components in the motor sequence which are completely unrelated to the pitch. They are not looking necessarily to see if someone stealing a base. They're not necessarily looking down at home plate where the batter is. They're doing things like touching the back of their ear before they bring the ball to their chin, or adjusting their hat.

What keeps chicago unique? A, one of the things, outside of segregation, racest housing policies and all the things that kind of cre neighborhoods that have high crime rates and keepin that way, is its history of gangs in this city, which is um fundamentally different than some of those other cities. L a had a similar history, as did new york, but their gangs didn't, a, grow as big and as pervasive as chicagos in terms of the level of organization and polit politicaliation. And that still lingers to this day, am guns. Chicago recovers more guns. There are more guns in chicago than there are in new york or la. And part of that is a, not necessarily the city's gun laws or the states, but our proximity to states like indiana, which is where a second largest source of guns come from, which is, is largely a cash and carry state. And the two other ones, which are really important, and there are others, one is the continued dominance of a a political machine system, which is slowly changed over time, but, you know, that's part of what keeps crime in some neighborhoods and not in other neighborhoods. It creates the boundaries, you know, almost criminological jerry mandering. Ah, you know, in a sense where, i'm going to actually write that one down in us.

So when i'm talking the networks are created through ances of coarest or being stopped together by the police. So it is actually setting aside anything around culpability. It's an observation made by police a point in time and space. Um, you know, there are biases in police data which are important. We're able to see a lot of those. So, say, failure to comply, often is something that's officer base. Robbery, assault, arson, things like that, tend to be come to the attention of police from civilians. So we take all those things to account. But basically, if you and i somebody together, we have a tie. And then if i, you know, committ an assault with somebody else, we have a tie. And you string these things together, and it creates actually, a network of of a risky behaviors, right? Things that are inherently you and i engaging in a behavior that could be risky. So, but your comment about victim and suspect, or people that are involved. M, i focus mainly on victims. One, because in chicago we have abysmally low clearance rates. But more to the point, violence prevention is about saving lives. And focusing on ho's in harm's way, who is experiencing trama, is the kind of most immediately actionable information. And we generally have all the information about who was injured. And from a public health standpoint, it shouldn't matter whether you have a felany conviction, or, you know, our bad parent, or you dropped out o none of that should matter if you're focusing on saving somebody's life.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#5200-the-science-of-contact-tracing><h3 id=5200-the-science-of-contact-tracing><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[52:00] The Science of Contact Tracing</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/36cab423-ddf6-4caa-a167-5fc88c8943b4 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (50:11 - 52:04)</a>

The motive, one of the motivations of this is, amost a huge baseball fan. We talked about mony ball, and i kind of realize that baseball has changed so much, i since due to the mony ball revolution. When i was a kid, the game of baseball looked different, like the infielders all stood in the same spot in every play. And now every play the infielders are all over the place. There's something he infield shift, which data scientists discovered was actually a better way. It looks insane, but you put most the infielders on one side of the field, it actually leads to better outcomes. And iwas think about, like, our personal lives, and i feel like most of us don't really use data driven, make data driven decisions. We generally do what feels about right and go with our gut s a kind what would a a data, what w would a data driven a life be like? And i think the area where there's the clearest and the monyball analogy extends best is dating a. So tha, there have been studies. There's a work by samantha joel where she studied 11 thousand romantic couples. And she had, ever she worked with 85 other scientists. She had every possible trait you could measure on them, their sexual tastes, their demographics, their values a, their physical appearance, as ranked by other people. And she and how happy they reported being in that relationship. And she and the other scientists used machine learning to try to find what is it about a person that predicts ou 're going to be happy in a relationship with them? And the overarching lesson is that it's incredibly hard to predict who makes someone happy. Like it's shockingly unpredictable. You would think that, like many qualities about a person would dramatically improve the odds they make you happy. And it seems in the datas, it's there are some things that moderately improve the odds, but they're not that big. And the striking thing about that study is you contrast that with scholars have studied on line dating, and they've mined through, you know, everybody's cliques and messages, and they saya what makes someone desirable in on line dating. And that is incredibly easy to predict. So its it. It may be hard to predict who's a good romantic partner, but it is so easy to predict who's desirable partner. In fact, they can even predict with high accuracy, not just whether you'r going to swipe left or right, but how long it's going to take you to swipe left or right. O if someone's close to your barometer, it's going to take you a little bit longer to make that decision.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#011458-race-and-dating><h3 id=011458-race-and-dating><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[01:14:58] Race and Dating</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/438b3961-ebd8-46e6-8de8-0d12eacb5270 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (01:12:13 - 01:15:00)</a>

Tall men, a each inch of height, th scholars have found, is worth about forty you have to make about forty thousand dollars of income as a man to overcome like one inh being one inch shorter. Certain occupations, not in women and men, lawyers, people in the ltary a do wegh better. In online dating. Students do horribly. I spent most o my life as a student and did horribly in dating. And now i know the reason for that. A, people work in transportation. A, inhospitality, disaster for men on dating sites, a similarity to oneselfa, people are drawnt. There's there's this idea that people are drawn to opposites. It's totally not true. On just about every dimension scholars can measure, people are drawn to people who are similar themselves, even on silk seemly silly things like how many photos you include in your profile. And my favorite, that people are 17 % more likely to match with someone who shares their initials on an online dating sight. Make totally ridiculous. If someone shares your initials, you're more likely to match with them, even take nto account everything else, like the religious background on this curious.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#getting-comfy-with-crypto-with-anthony-pompliano><h1 id=getting-comfy-with-crypto-with-anthony-pompliano><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Getting Comfy with Crypto with Anthony Pompliano</h1></a><p><img src="https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimage.simplecastcdn.com%2Fimages%2Ff26e4efc-7b89-4b8a-93fc-2522d5c9cd13%2F7a194845-533b-4950-bbe6-de6a26bb06cf%2F3000x3000%2Fthe-important-part-podcast-logo-3000-x-3000-spotlight-blue.jpg%3Faid%3Drss_feed&w=200&h=200" width=200 alt=Cover|200></p><a href=#snips-54><h2 id=snips-54><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Snips</h2></a><a href=#2748-do-you-think-fiat-currencies-will-go-away><h3 id=2748-do-you-think-fiat-currencies-will-go-away><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[27:48] Do You Think Fiat Currencies Will Go Away?</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/6a80d91e-4c7c-4d9d-bdeb-5a375e5c460c rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (27:33 - 29:05)</a>

And our james hemmings, when he was in france, had much more to do with french law, which at the time, was on the side of the enslaved person. I mean, people who petitioned for freedom in france, people who had been brought the colonies and so forth, or other enslaved people who were brought there from other places who petitioned for freedom, had those petitions granted routinely. So when he's there with james hemmings, he knows that it's possible that james might at some point petition for his freedom. So he handles, i think, although he doesn't say this, but this is the time when he begins to pay james hemming's regular wages. James becomes the chef de cuisine at the hotel de langiac, jefferson's residence. Before he had been giving james spending money or gratuities.

Who was she and what did she become to jefferson?</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br><br>Well, sally hemmings, sarah, a nicknamed sally, was sister to robert annd james. She had been something of a companion to jefferson's so she went along, and she was 14. And while she was there, we don't know when she became jeffersons. And their son says, concubine is the term that he uses. And she became pregnant by jefferson, and she wanted to stay in france. By the time jefferson ink that he wants to come home, she wanted to stay. And actually, all the young people in the hotel de langiac wanted to stay in france. Nobody wanted to go home. But jefferson promised her that if she came back with him, she would have a good life at montecallo, and their children would be freed when they were 21 years old. So she agreed to that. She was 16 years old at the time, and she came back to virginia with jefferson.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br><br>So for us, at least with the vantage of history, this seems almost incomprehensible as a decision.

That was sort of a point of mystery for me, about sally hemmings. But when i started writing the hemmings o monticello and working on that, and i realized how important family was or i began to think about how important family would have been to some one like that, a 16 year old female raised to believe that she had some special connection to family. In a way, to think about family, think about your mother is back in virginia. Her sisters and brothers were there. So that would be an impetus an that was sort of a dilemma that many slave people faced. Do you run away and have freedom by yourself, or do you stay and stick it out with your family? The other thing to consider is that jefferson treated sally hemmings and her sisters and brothers very differently than he did the other aves on the mountain.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#1738-early-age-of-consent-is-hard-to-confront-but-normal-in-those-times><h3 id=1738-early-age-of-consent-is-hard-to-confront-but-normal-in-those-times><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[17:38] Early Age of Consent is Hard to Confront But Normal in those Times</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/e95853b8-296c-4dec-83b0-f4b6d753ef24 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 17secÔ∏è (16:30 - 16:48)</a>

I like to advise leaders to see themselves as curators of key stories within organizations. You need to tell the story, but also give the moral of the story. And so one very well known example is southwest airlines. They were running out of money early in their operations. They were using four jets at the time, and they couldn't make their pay roll. So they had to sell one of the jets to pay employees that month. And they went to employees and said, we're going to sell one of our jets, but we want to run the same routes with three jets instead of four. How can we do that? And employees came back with the idea of turning the planes more quickly than they were before. So southwest now continues to be known for its turn time, the amount of time it takes to come back in the gate, unload passen s and bags, you know, clean the plane, reload passengers and bags and take off. And that's part of southwest' sort of deep strategy.

Nowin last such episode, we spoke at length about one a bloody remarkable thing called half brain sleep. Well, to day is all about the equally remarkable fact that when it comes to dream sleep, we humans are special. And i mean very special indeed. I'm even going to propose that this unique aspect of human sleep is one of many reasons that justifies our homined name. Because the term homo sapiens is derived from the latin root meaning wise person. And i'll come back to that in just a second, but let's return to sleep. Here is how we are special. Compared to old and new world monkeys as well as apes such as chimpanzees and gorillas. Human sleep sticks out like a proverbial sore thumb in terms of slumber. Or i should actually say two sore thumbs. As first, we are unique in the sense that the total amount of time that we spend asleep is significantly shorter than all other primates. We will typically average around eight hours relative to somewhere between ten to 15 ous of sleep that we've measured in all other primates. The second thing, however, is that, in striking contrast, we humans have a staggering and disproportionate amount of rem sleep, of dream sleep. Because if you look all other primates, if you average them together, will come in at around about nine % of the sleep time dedicated to rem sleep. But in humans, that number is somewhere between 20 to 25 % of all our sleep time being dedicated to rem sleep, dreaming.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#0842-sleeping-in-trees-meant-less-rem-sleep><h3 id=0842-sleeping-in-trees-meant-less-rem-sleep><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[08:42] Sleeping in Trees Meant Less REM Sleep</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/1bfbafe8-5b34-485c-8729-cd64da56a96c rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (06:40 - 08:42)</a>

Ant were constantly feeding or subconscious with the a chemical knowledge of the chemical constituents of other people, right? So it goes way beyond how people smell, how they look, et cetera.

But because these ideas that he put forward spread as fast as they did and as globally as they did, literally, it's a hundred and forty years since marks died. And in that time, his ideas have become major types of thinking in every country on the earth. Ah, if you know much about the great ideas of human tory, ah, that's an extraordinary spread in an extraordinarily short period of historical time. And what that has meant, that speed of spread and that geographic diversity, is that the marxian ideas eracted with very different cultural histories, religious histories and economic conditions. So the end result was that the ideas were interpreted differently in different places at different times. And therefore, marxism, as a kind of first flush definition, is the totality of all these very different ways of coming to terms with it. For the first roughly forty, 50 years, marxism was te tradition of thinking critically about capitalism. Marks himself, that's all he really did. He never wrote a book about communism. He never wrote a book really about socialism either. His comments were occasional, fragmentary, dispersed. What he was really interested in was a critical analysis of capitalism. And that's what marxism was more or less in its first forty or 50 years. A the only qualification of what i just said was something that happened in paris for a few weeks in 18 71, there was a collapse of the french government consequent upon losing a war to bismarck's germany.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#1553-marxism-is-a-critique-of-capitalism-and-we-can-do-better><h3 id=1553-marxism-is-a-critique-of-capitalism-and-we-can-do-better><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[15:53] Marxism is a Critique of Capitalism and we can do better</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/2de666e7-a95c-48d2-a7de-1d94c639b55c rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (13:43 - 15:53)</a>

Anyway, the importance in terms of marxism is that now, this seizure of power by a group of marxists, that is, a group of people inspired by marks, developing what you might call a russian even though there were differences among the sians too, but a russian interpretation. This now has to be transformed from a critique of capitalism into a plan, at least, what are you going to do in the soviet union? And a lot of this was then trial and error. Mark never laid any of this out. Probably wouldn't have been all that relevant if he had, cause it was 50 years earlier, in another country, et cetera. So what begins to happen, and you can see how this happens then, more later, in china and cuba and tetnam and korea and so on, is that you have kind of a bifercation. Much of marxism remains, chiefly the critique of capitalism, but another part of it becomes a set, and they differ from one to the other, a set of notions of what an alternative, post capitalist society ought to look like, how it ought to work. And there's lots of disagreement about it, lots of confusion. Ah, and i would say that that's still where it is.

And that's what motivates me. Getting the skills has real world implications. It took me from scrounging in my couch cushions to find enough change to put gas in my car to building a billion dollar business. It is absolutely limitless what you can accomplish. Now think about that. If that's really true, if what i just said is true, that human potential is limitless, then how you spend your time becomes a spiritual consideration. You're the average of the five peope you spend the most time with. That's just true. And but now it's become so common to say, and it's like every instagram post that i fear it's going to lose its meaning. Who are you spending time with? Because if you're spending time with people like you, you're spending time with people like me, i'm raising you up, or i'm just not going to spend time with you. So it's like, now, if you get in a mix of people like that, who are like men, we'd love for you to raise up to this level. But if you don't, it's fine, but we're just not goin tospend time with you. All of a sudden that desire to belong to something powerful that you can see is going to lead you to your dreams. And i remember saying to my wife over and over and over, they are the surest path to my success. I don't know anything else. I just know if i can hang on to these guys, they're going to make me better. And so that was through all the years of being embarrassed and developing, actually, massive anxiety, because i was always behind. I was always the dumbest person on the phone. I was always the dumbest person in the room. And it was like, was i going to be willing to emotionally go through that to get great? And most people can't. So here's a thing. Now, imagine i'm not the only person they said, hey, this is the start of m you know, any job you want. They i saw 12 people, maybe more, come and go over the years. B u. They just couldn't emotionally deal with it. And so i remember thinking to myself, why is it that i'm able to do this? And the answer was, i could self soothed faster than anyone else. So i would get kicked in the face and i would do something really dumb. I'd be called an idiot, told how stupid i was, and then i'd just be like, r i need to re center. And that just became my obsession. I need to be able to emotionally get back to complete neutral so fast that you don't even see it register on my face. How' you do it? How do you do literally practising. So remember, the same time, i'm reading about the brain voraciously. I'm reading about people that understand human behavior. I'm getting into cognitive science, noral science, like really going into it. So i'm reading all the stuff going wo we're just a chemical processing plant. There are physiological hooks into these chemicals. So hey, if you're ad, scared, whatever, but you force yourself to laugh out loud, you will change your neuro chemical state. And you literally, your experience is the neuro chemistry. So i like woe. So i could get i could be in a situation where 'm being beraded, or i legitimately mess up and it costs money, and it's like, woe. That's on me. And it is. Nobody's bad but my on.

And if you find yourself doing that, i will say, hit the brakes right? Because first and foremost, you always want to look at what you could be doing. So there's two things you could be doing up in your game. No matter how good you think you are, you're still being ignored. And so if we talk about getting so good that they can't ignore you, then we know that we haven't achieved that yet. And then the second thing you can do is move on. And well, i know that i s brutally difficult to hear. If we're dealing with insecurities, then that may be the only solution. So first, i want to focus the most of our attention on this idea that you really can get so good that you can't be ignored. And i think a great example of this is garry van chuck. Now, if you guys don't know his story, it's such a cool story of somebody who came up working for their father. Their dad, i'm sure, in many ways, thought of them the same way that, you know, he was just the kid. And it got to the point where garry saw an opportunity for him to do something in a completely different part of the business, where he could establish himself. So now it was about an area that his father didn't understand, his father didn't have expertese, and garry could show with results, point blank, that he was able to do something that his father wasn't. He took ther a liquor store business from something like six million dollars in revenue to, i think, almost 70 million dollars in revenue. I mes, extraordinary in a relatively short period of time, just a few years, if i'm not mistaken. So that's the kind of thing there's no way, no matter how insecure the other person is, no matter how they may have their own a problems, emotionally soothing, or staying centred, or getting their ego out of the way, whatever the things are that they're dealing with, there's no way to look at those numbers and not say, a ight, clearly, what he was doing is working. And to me, that is where you have to get. You've got to get to the point wherei it would just be absurd to anybody looking at that situation to think that you weren't killing it.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#2503-be-kind-to-the-worst-player><h3 id=2503-be-kind-to-the-worst-player><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[25:03] Be Kind to the Worst Player</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/52389325-c581-4e5d-97ed-856f28003a22 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (24:54 - 27:07)</a>

In that case, test fattat thats i think we need to define steel.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br><br>Steel manningk, i know what les tis riting is. I really resent that form of argumentation. Sure, i really resent it. I have the right to talk about whatever the hell i want, and no one's going to stop me or try to intimidate me or tell me that i can't, simply because of my skin color. And i think that if i said to somebody else the other way round, it would be equally reprehensible if i said, shut up. You have no right to criticise anything that douglas murray says because you've not got my skin colour. Ok, it's not an exact comparison, but seriously, is that? Is that a reasonable form of argument? Ar you haven't been through everything i've been through in my life, therefore you can't comment. No, in that case, nobody can talk about any hin. We might as well pack up, go home and isolate ourselves.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#3600-the-lived-experience-is-used-to-hijack-conversation><h3 id=3600-the-lived-experience-is-used-to-hijack-conversation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[36:00] The Lived Experience is Used to Hijack Conversation</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/bc5dfab4-c451-4388-b95f-bb9230d827ca rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 3minÔ∏è (33:26 - 37:24)</a>

Not in this particular situation, but there's people that have lived through something, they can comment in a very specific way, like, for example, holcott's survivors. Yes, there is a sense in which may be a basic sense of civility when a holicost survivor is speaking about their experience of the holocost than a an intellectual from a very different part of the world is simply writing about a neon deo, politics. He world war too. Just should not interrupt the holcot survivor. We might physically interrupt them if they telling us an dortis with logic and reason, that the experience of the holicot survivor is somehow fundamentally has a deeper understanding of the humanity and the injustice.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br><br>First of all, i again, when even deeper warters now. But in terms of wanting to listen to another person who has experienced something, yes, yes. But not endlessly, not endlessly. I mean, there are some people who've written about the, i the are people whove writen about the holocaust who didn't experience the holocaust, and have written about it better than people who did. It's not this, this, this idea that the lived experience, to use this terrible modern jargon, as if there's another type. This this this idea that the lived experience has to try umph over everything else, is not always correct. It can be correct in some circumstances. If you were sitting in a room with a hollocost survivor and somebody who'd never heard about the holicoust and wanted a kind of, you know, shoot out their views on it, yes, one of those people should be heard more than the other, obviously, sly, if there's somebody who's experienced raceisn first hand, and there's somebody else who has never experienced it, then obviously you'd want to hear from the person who has experienced it first hand. If that is the discussion under way. I don't think that it's the case, that that is endlessly the case. I'm also highly reluctant to concede that there are groups of people who, by dint of their skin collar or anything else, get to dominate the microphone. Of course, we're literally both speaking to microphones at the moment, so there's an irony to this. But let's skate over th what i mean is people saying, you don't have the right to speak. I have the right to take myke friend from you and speak because i know best. Fine, if you know best, we'll argue it out, and some one will win, long or short term. But the the er, the almost aggressive tone in which this is now levelled, i don't like the sound of nobody's experience is completely understandable by another human being. Nobody's. And what many people are asking us to do at the moment, us collect tively, is to fall for that thing. I think it was camille faster who said, at first, but i've adopted in recent years, is to say, you must spend an inordinate amount of your life trying to understand me personally, my lived experience, everything about me, you should dedicate your life to into. Do that. Simultaneously, you'll never understand me. This is not an attractive invitation.

So for instance, it crosses all racial boundaries. Obviously, i go without saying more interesting as it crosses all class boundaries and socio economic boundaries. And if i wase to sort of simplify this thought, i would say, i guess that you and i and everybody watching knows, or has known somebody in their lives who has almost nothing in worldly terms, and is a generous person, a kindly person, a giving person, a a happy person, even a cheerful person.

Their sister once did something tta she shouldn't. She got this, and i should have got that, and and on and on and on. It's a human trait. And what one of the things that suggests to me is that we therefore have a choice in our lives about this. This is something which we can do something abouti not limitlessly, but for instance, i mean, there are very good reasons thas some people in their lives might feel resentment. Let's say you're involved in a car crash and a friend fell asleep at the wheel, and that's why you are spending the rest of your life in a wheel chair.

But they never have, and they never will, because the whole thing is rotten from the start. But let me just also say one thing, because, of course, mark isn't as nice as he sounds. Nd, that's one of the things thati try to highlight in the book is, if we're going to do this reductive thing of people in history and saying whell they had views that were of their time, and we must therefore condemn them for them, say, fine, let's do the same thing with marks. And there are things i quote in this book for mark's letters, not least letters to engles. And indeed, in his published writings, in part piece he was writing for the american press in the eight in fifties, the way, he has horrible views on slavery and and and er colonialism and much more. But the main thing is only the horrible things he says about black people and the con use of the nd word. In fact, when i was doing the udea book for the walnwets, i had to decide will i read out the quotes from marks or not. If i had read them out, i'd have been cancelled, because peoplewould have just said, you've been using the end word so much in this passage, and you know this. And i slightly thought doing it, so that i could say i was only quoting marks to try to hit the point home. In the end, of course, i was sensible, and as i did not do but mark's letters are disgusting on these terms. Since i highlighted this in this book, and some of the media have picked it up a and er and have popularized this, i'm trying to put into the system, which is, if you're going to accuse churchill of racism, ou're gon to accuse, accuse jefferson of racism, washington of racism. And someone what about marks? The two things that mariss have said since this came out has been, first of all, why are you saying this about marks? He was a man of his time, like everyone else. And second thing they say is, we don't go to marks for his horrible, abhorrent views on race. They're talking about mixed race people as guerillas and so on. We don't go to him for that. We go to him for his economic theories. I say, ok, well, we don't go to thomas jefferson for his views on slaves. We don't go to churchill for his the precise language he used that points in the 19 tens about indians, or his health advice, or his health advice.

That then makes it possible to then take the next step and ponder and reason and figure out something that you previously didn't have that intuition about. It then ultimately becomes a part of the intuition that the next generation of mathematical thinkers have to ground their own thinking on, so that they can extend the ideas even further. I came across this quotation from enri poincare while i was walking in the in the woods with my wife in a state park in northern californiaa late last summer. And what it said on the bench was, it is by logic that we prove, by intuition that we discover. And so what what for me, the essence of the of the project is to understand how to bring the intuitive connectionist resources to bear on letting the intuitive discovery arise, you know, from engagement in thinking with this formal system. So i think of, you know, the ability of somebody like hinton or newton, or einstein, or romelhart, or picera, to a archimedes, another example, writes, suddenly a flash of insight occurs. It's, it's like the constellation of all o these simultaneous constraints that somehow or other causes the mind to settle into a novel state that it never did before, and and give rise to a new idea a that, you know, then you can say, ok, well, now, how can i prove this? You know, how do i write down the steps of that theorem that that allow me to make it rigorous and certain? And so i feel like the the kinds of things that we're beginning to see deep learning systems do of their own accord kind of gives me this feeling of, of, am, i don't know, hope or encouragement that ultimately, um, it'll all happen. Am, so in particular, as a many people now, have have become really interested in thinking about, you know, noral networks that have been trained with massive amounts of text can be given a prompt, and they can then sort of generate some really interesting, fanciful, creative story from that prompt. A and ah, there's, there's kind of like a sense that they've somehow synthesized something like a novel out of the, you know, all f the particulars of all the billions and billions of experiences that went into the training data, that it gives rise to something like this sort of intuitive sense of what would be a, a fun and interesting little story to tell, or something like that. It just sort of wells up out of the, out of the letting the thing play out its own imagining of what somebody might say given this prompt, as as impot to get itto to start to generate its own thoughts and and to me, that that sort of represents the potential of capturing this, the intuitive side of this.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#015227-the-difference-between-language-and-mathematical-cognition><h3 id=015227-the-difference-between-language-and-mathematical-cognition><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[01:52:27] The Difference Between Language and Mathematical Cognition</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/fd70617a-7d16-4f01-91f5-ffcda7d8ef2f rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 4minÔ∏è (01:48:57 - 01:53:09)</a>

A, but i i think the answer is, in important ways, it is important draw that line, but then to come back and look at it again and see some of the subtleties and interesting aspects of the difference. A, so if we think about chomsky himself, um, he e was born into an academic family. His father was a professor of rabinical studies at a small rabbinical college in philadelphia. A, and he was deeply inculturated in a, you know, a culture of thought and reason, and brought to the effort to understand natural language this profound engagement with these formal systems. And a, you know, i think that there was tremendous power in that, and that chamsky had some azing insight into the structure of natural language. But that use the word but there, the actual intuitive knowledge of these things only goes so far, and does not go as far as it does in people like thomsky himself. And this was something that was discovered in the phd. Dissertation of lila glightman, who was actually trained in the same linguistic department with chomsky. So what lila discovered was that the intuitions that linguists had about even the meaning of a phrase, not just about its but about what they thought a phrase must mean, were very different from the intuitions of an ordinary person who wasn't a formally trained thinker. And well, it recently has become much more salient. I happened to have learned about this when i myself was a ph d. Student at the university of pennsylvania, but im i never knew how to put it together with all my other thinking about these things. So so i actually currently have the hypothesis that formerly trained linguists and other formally trained a academics, whether it be linguistics, philosophy, cognitive science, computer s, machine learning, mathematics, a have a mot if engagement with experience that is intuitively, deeply structured to be more organized around a the systematicity, a and a ability to be conformant with the principles of a system than a than is actually true of the natural human</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#015337-the-expert-blind-spot-is-more-prosaic><h3 id=015337-the-expert-blind-spot-is-more-prosaic><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[01:53:37] The Expert Blind Spot Is More Prosaic</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/03fa38c8-730b-4bdd-b409-6c112e0389e9 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (01:53:09 - 01:55:23)</a>

And so, well, they were psyc atrist, right? So i had to be a psychiatrist. Anda that meant i had to go to medical school. And i got to college, and i find myself taking, you know, the first semester of a three quarter physics class, and it was mechanics. And this was so far from what it was i was interested in, but it was also too early in the morning, in the winter quart somester. So i never made it of the physics class. But i wandered about the rest of my freshman year and most of my sophomore year until, a, i found myself in the midst of this situation where around me, m there was this big revolution happening. I was at columbia university in 19 68, and the via um war is going on. Columbia is building a gim in morningside heights, which is part of harlem. And people are thinking, oh, the big bad rich guys are stealing the the the park land that belong to the people of harlem. And a, you know, they're part of the military industrial complex, which is enslaving us and sending us all off to war in vianom. And so there is a big revolution that a confluence of black activism and, you know, s t s and social justice, and the whole university blew up and got shut down. And a, i got a chance to sort of think about why people were behaving the way they were in this context. And i, you know, i happened to have taken mathematical statistics. I happened to have been takin psychology that quarter, ad just sike one and somehow things in that space all ran together in my mind and got me really excited about about asking questions about why people, what made certain people go into the buildings and not others, and things like that. And so suddenly i had a path forward. And i had just been wandering around aimlessly and athe different points my career, you know, when i think, ok, well, should i take this class? Or should i just read that book about some idea that i want to understand better, you know? Or should i, should i pursue the thing that excites me and interests me, or should i, you know, meet somereu ment? You know, that's i always did the latter.

I think that most of the time, the way the body works is the best solution. I haven't seen many alternatives, so it's hard to compare. But a, i think, you know, there's some parts of the body that make more sense than others. You know, the way our hands work, for instance. Ah, you know, the muscles are up in the forearm, and the tendons kind of come down likea strings on a puppet. And just the dexterity it gives our hands is just really amazing. And it's hard to imagine a better, a better tool than the human hand to do everything, from, you now, hold things, to play piano and do a million other daily activities that we do. One thing i talk about in the book, there's some other body parts that seem to be lacking that kind of brilliant a design, such as the throat. You know, where thea food drink are swallowed and air is inhaled. And they kind of, those two paths come within millimeters of each other, and you slip up once you laugh while eating, or you speak while trying to swallow, and you die from choking. So it seems less than optimal, though i'm not sure it could be better. From the way we're kindof formed in the womb as a beginning as the tiny little tube. I don't think it could have been done any better, or there's any other way to do it. But it is an unfortunate thing that ou kno, does lead to some problems.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#1006-the-thumb-is-it-fundamental-to-humanity><h3 id=1006-the-thumb-is-it-fundamental-to-humanity><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[10:06] The Thumb, Is It Fundamental To Humanity?</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/284280d5-1f66-4140-8339-03a3ef996ca3 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (08:37 - 10:04)</a>

And you know, when we when plastic surgeons, wo are often the ones to repair thatome the dorothopetic surgeons.

Then once you start getting multi cellular organisms, the kind that are thicker, and the ones on the inside are in contact with that sort of nutritious brew that they're growing in, ah, you kind of need a way to distribute those nutrients to every cell.
