YEA often began past school years with less than 2 weeks to plan the fellowship, socials, and speaker events. This cold start led to suboptimal outcomes, such as fewer speaker events (about 2 per semester).</p><p>We believe we can substantially increase the number of events and offerings with some planning. We will take on tasks of critical importance, such as speaker events, as well as tasks that YEA members often say are ‚Äúreally nice to have‚Äù, but table during the school year due to more pressing logistics. These involve documentation, Slack, Asana, etc.</p><p>One executive member, Braden Wong, will be managing a team of 6 high-potential community builders and report weekly to the YEA Exec. Detailed tasks and agendas in next section.</p><p>Thomas and I attempted to reach out to Emma Williamson but did not get a response.

Please ignore the fund&rsquo;s current balance: if a request exceeds our available funding, we will suggest a lower grant amount or fundraise from additional donors, rather than rejecting your application.</p><p>We also suggest that you build a buffer into your budget (e.g. 10-20% of the total budget). We find that applicants systematically underestimate the real costs of their project.</p><p>Please specify the currency your request is denominated in.</p><p>Please also provide a very rough breakdown of your budget (e.g., &ldquo;45% on salary for me for 6 months, 35% for payroll insurance/tax, 10% for a contractor, 10% on software and other expenses&rdquo;). If you prefer, you can provide a range of values or specify multiple scenarios. If you are applying as an individual and this grant is a primary source of income, please ensure you are applying for the full payroll cost including self-employment taxes (
