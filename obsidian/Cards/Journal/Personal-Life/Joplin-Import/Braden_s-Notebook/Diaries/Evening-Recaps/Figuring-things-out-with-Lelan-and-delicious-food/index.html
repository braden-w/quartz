I practiced briefly, describing my thought process as describing the whole situation as hilarious.
¬†
During lunch, there were Free Apple Cinnamon Donuts for pickup at Cross Campus. I picked some up with Andrew and Kevin and David, which was quite fun.
¬†
Pulled beef is delicious, pasta so delicious, apple strudel delicious, and salad was great with Arugela! The food today was just absolutely delicious, especially dinner.
¬†
Call with Philosophy where we discussed children, living vicariously through another, etc. Armando asked what my potential major was out of interest.
¬†
Afterwards, we had a meeting with YEA Board and talked about our website. The credit card didn&rsquo;t work because of McKenzie&rsquo;s purchase of so many Among Us games, which was HILARIOUS.
¬†
I stopped by Morse on a whim to pick up Moon Cake. I thought everything was really awkward once Lelan came, but I made the best of it and wanted to leave early for 230. She texted me afterwards asking if everything was okay, and I had a long pause as I thought about what to say. She offered to talk and even walked to Hopper to talk to me.
¬†
I briefly practiced what I would talk about in front of my mirror. Honestly, though I was initially nervous I took full responsibility and told God that whatever happens happens. There is no better way to explain the situation than in person.
¬†
I walked around with Lelan and explained myself. As I explained, I am an absolutely terrible texter, and am soooo sorry for what happened. I misinterpreted the second text as going out on a date, we just started out on the wrong foot. But, let&rsquo;s start from the beginning! I think you&rsquo;re absolutely amazing, and if you would ever like to go out, I would be honored to.
¬†
We walked over to the laundry room to sit down and talk, and although it was incredibly awkward at first, I found a way to capitalize and make the best of it. I offered her my hand, and then my arm, and we just sat and talked with each other while cuddling. While we did this, Flora came in and did the laundry. It was quite a funny situation. We played with each other&rsquo;s fingers, rocked side to side, other wholesome things. Lelan remarked that she had never gone this fast with anyone before, and I reassured her that if she ever felt uncomfortable we could stop. She told me how sweet of a talker was, asked for my number, and then we walked back together to Morse.
¬†
I am absolutely a legend. This was perhaps one of the most difficult situations that I have ever navigated: translating someone from the half-friendzone into the other zone. Navigating this situation taught me that being confident and happy/excited to discuss things often leads to the best outcomes.
¬†
Sincerely, what a great night. Later that night, I tried to do 230 and was able to obtain answers for all questions except for number 1b). During that time, we had some great laughs, among these following topics:
¬†</p><ul><li><p>He&rsquo;s meticulous. But he&rsquo;s also cool. For some reason, Andrew and I really laughed at this when Kevin explained that his friend wasn&rsquo;t only meticulous with his notes. I asked himi if he was a good student, and Kevin said he&rsquo;s cool. Didn&rsquo;t answer my question, and we laughed so hard.</p></li><li><p>Bean bags on heads</p></li><li><p>The 230 sitcom, as Sophia is laughing her ass off, Kevin has a beanbag on his head, and Andrew is roasting other people&rsquo;s proofs.</p></li><li><p>Trump got COVID. We were absolutely shocked</p></li></ul><p>¬†
Overall, what a great night. I called my parents and recapped them on the events of the night. I am just too good.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3></h3><ul class=backlinks><li></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3></h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p></p><ul><li><a href=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/braden-w>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
