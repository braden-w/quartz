Four years of friendship, challenge, and memories come to a close.</p><p>As coronavirus challenges us and social distancing helped us celebrate in special ways, I miss .</p><p> </p><p>What we do in the dark is what makes us shine in the light.</p><p> </p><p>The quiet hours we spent at the library studying for exams. The all-nighters we grinded away assignments the day before they were due. The countless sessions we spent practicing our craft, our talents, our passions. The moments that made us who we are today were not always in front of the world when everyone saw us, but when we were alone and nobody was watching.</p><p> </p><p>Sure, I wish we could be walking on that stage, taking pictures together, and receiving our diplomas. I wish we could hug, celebrate Prom. But that doesn&rsquo;t detract from our . Our graduation will go down in history not only as the . But that doesn&rsquo;t detract from anything, because today, we are still graduating. Hindsight may be 2020, but today, 2020 is the future. 2020 is perfect vision. 2020 is us. We can become visionaries, through seeing things through the right lens.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>###</p><p> </p><p>In one of my favorite stories, a young athlete once announced to the world that he would become the best in the world. At first, people laughed at him. They told him he was ridiculous, cocky, that he wouldn&rsquo;t get his dream.</p><p> </p><p>But what else happens when you announce your dream to the entire world? The best coaches recognize your talent. The right trainers start knocking on your door. The right team offer you contracts. The unshakeable mindset is born.</p><p> </p><p>Do not be afraid to share your dreams. People might doubt you. People might laugh at you. But it is the only way people will know to help you.</p><p> </p><p>People often ask me why I am optimistic, and I point to this story and a simple sentence:</p><p> </p><p>If you don’t believe in yourself, no one will do it for you.</p><p> </p><p>This sentence is no ordinary sentence, because that sentence came from Kobe Bryant. Because this was the story of Kobe Bryant.</p><p> </p><p>He was bigger than basketball. Kobe, we miss you not just for the basketball player you were, but for being the person we all wanted to become. Mamba mentality. Our hearts go to the Bryant family.</p><p> </p><p>###</p><p> </p><p>So what do I mean when I say the darkness will make you shine in the light?</p><p> </p><p>I mean the 4-AM wakeups Kobe made so he could practice more than anyone else. I mean the 6 years Michael Phelps went to practice every day without a single vacation because he didn&rsquo;t want to lose progress. I mean the 12 years Steve Jobs spent fired from his own company, the months Elon Musk spent near bankrupt and the laughing stock of Wall Street.</p><p> </p><p>Your most defining moments will be spent alone</p><p> </p><p>But I also mean the fun things. The moments we spend with family. The Zoom calls with our buddies. The minecraft servers with our friends.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Because when we are in the spotlight like now, it is our devotion to skills, ourselves, and our families, that show through.</p><p> </p><p>So how do you improve your vision?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2. To be interesting, be interested.</p><p> </p><p>The quality that brings us our greatest moments are not talent or even hard work, but the simple act of expressing interest and discovering new opportunities.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The biggest risk is not taking any. If you live your entire life trying to minimize failure, then you will never maximize success. James Clear once said, failure is a one-time cost, while regret is a recurring cost. The pain of inaction stings far longer than the incorrect action.</p><p> </p><p>Do not make people extraordinary as an excuse not to succeed. If I bleed, I&rsquo;ll bleed red blood just like you. I have failed, just like you.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nobody sees your failures, only your successes, but that should be the most liberating feeling of all. You have complete freedom to fail.</p><p> </p><p>As slam poet In-Q once said, you&rsquo;re not going through it, it&rsquo;s going through you. You control the narrative and what events mean to you, meaning these events, they don’t happen to you, they happen for you, for you to process and see through the right 2020 lens.</p><p> </p><p>Our generation was born after and generation is graduating during some of the nation&rsquo;s greatest challenges. But that makes us all more capable, qualified, deserving, to make it better. We have not been spoonfed a narrative that life will be easy. We will not just be resilient in the face of danger, because resilience is based off our breaking point; we will not be tempered, because even tempered things shatter; no&ndash;we will bend, we will roll, we will be shatterproof, unshakeable, antifragile, because we are never going to break.***END OF FILE***</p><p> </p><p>Today, many of you know me as ASB President, but many of you don’t know that before that victory, I lost four of five elections in middle school. I won the last one only because it took second place. I was when I first started out. When I attended the informational meeting, it wasn&rsquo;t because I planned to win, but because I didn’t know who I would sit with for lunch. I wanted to connect. many of my friends had moved to different schools. I decided to take a risk beyond my comfort zone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But don’t expect a silver lining in failure. I wish I could tell you that life is fair. It is not. You do not have to remember your failures, because frankly, nobody else will.</p><p> </p><p>Do not chase success. Chase problems. Success comes naturally.</p><p> </p><p>If you want to be a visionary, I have simple advice: history remembers those who believed in the future.</p><p> </p><p>You don’t know which one will, but you need to treat every decision like it can.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When your problem is &ldquo;how do I show up to practice 2 hours early&rdquo; than &ldquo;how do I show up just in time&rdquo;.</p><p>In quarantine, we spend more time in the dark, waiting for that opportunity of light to come. It will not be easy. As we gear up to face a world where challenges are ever abundant, are we practicing? Are we learning? Are we getting stronger?</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3></h3><ul class=backlinks><li></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3></h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p></p><ul><li><a href=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/braden-w>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
