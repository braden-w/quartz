Please help me and let my words come out right now in free flow! There is so much writing to be done and not enough progress. I have made so much progress today. I know that it is within me to achieve this. Let me get all of this junk and raw emotion out of my head onto paper. I am dreaming of what it takes to get a poem. I am dreaming what it takes to get out of this situation and have this godforsaken competition be over. I am dreaming what it takes to get a medal. But I don&rsquo;t need to get a medal.</p><p>¬†</p><p>Let&rsquo;s be at peace with not winning. For if I do not win, I still have won the greatest experience of being a better poem and writer with a stronger voice. I am playing against myself, the spiked version of all the greats I have ever witnessed. And if writing is not for me, I will still write with a passion. Ten years from now, I will publish a book, and remember this moment with a smile. There is no need to be worried about not writing good prose when your future is safe. Do you hear me?</p><p>¬†</p><p>Braden, your future is wholeheartedly safe. I just wanted to let you know just in case you needed to remember. It&rsquo;s easy to forget sometimes. You don&rsquo;t have to forget. You&rsquo;re not doing it this time because you are out of dideas or in a corner or do not have to succeed. You can let time pass, this entire competition pass, and still be happy. If this competition is over, and I have not submitted anything, I will still be as happy and grateful as can be. I am so grateful for the opportunity to meet with these three tutors, get critical feedback, and experience the stress of being crunched to a time limit. I have discovered the wonder of working inside a Starbucks, gained weight for the winter months, and discovered new jackets today.</p><p>¬†</p><p>Today I repaired an old man&rsquo;s computer. He sat next to me in a Starbucks shop. I entered his computer and looked and uninstalled all of his web extensions. I opened his antivirus and command line and couldn&rsquo;t do anything. After much deliberation, I gave up. Then I restarted the whole thing. His face lit up with amazement. He loved me for it. Offered to buy a drink. There is something to do for everyone. My heart felt warm and lit up. I will remember this man forever.</p><p>¬†</p><p>Imagine after this competition. The relief on your face. The stress relieved! That is what we are going for. Let&rsquo;s try writing it in and smiling and having a great time. There is only growth to be taken from this experience and the discomfort. There is only sleep to be had and grades to be raised with ease after this. There is nothing but excitement for what is about to happen!</p><p>¬†</p><p>Dear Lord, bless me with the ideas I need to make a wonderful piece tonight. I am asking, beseeching, because I do not have to produce my best work tonight. I am not entitled to anything, and we are going to pull a SirTag: how well can we finess a W? That is the question. I have three mentors who are providing feedback and what is necessary to get everything done. I am watching the homeless roam the streets tonight and cna feel the darkness in the air. I can feel the loneliness and crunch I will be having tomorrow night.</p><p>¬†</p><p>I have every resource I need. If there is more to be done, I&rsquo;ll do it. Let&rsquo;s keep at it and upping my confidence. This is a sprint to see how many words I can get off my chest in 25 minutes. No challenge could be a better one for an aspiring writer. Here it goes:</p><p>¬†</p><p>Let the words flow so effortlessly from my fingers into the keyboard onto this wonderful purple screen and make every word blessed with the voice that is mine for readers to enjoy. Let me rejoice at this opportunity with gratitude by my new mentors and listen to their feedback and be willing to do what it takes.</p><p>¬†</p><p>I&rsquo;M WILLING TO DO WHAT IT TAKES!! Yvonne is rooting for me and drew a little notecard and a beautiful rose on my Starbucks Cup and a little inspiration on my note. DON&rsquo;T STRESS MR. PRESIDENT! she said. I can&rsquo;t agree more. In this room surrounded by wood, coffee, and the relaxing, I feel only relaxation. I am so grateful to have this special night.</p><p>¬†</p><p>Writing is only an endless opportunity to learn something new. I learn how to order from Starbucks and enjoy myself and think about Nicole and enjoy some Panda Express and continue writing with all of my heart and vigor and pour it out onto a screen for nobody else to ever have to worry about reading. I open dozens of tabs with the intent of learning something new and read and write and absorb all of this new information for the next years to come. My tutor Miles and Jeffrey and Samantha will give so much feedback and help me become a better writer along my literary journey. I haven&rsquo;t had the opportunity to meet Miles yet but I expect him to be just as awesome to talk to as Jeffrey and Samantha. I feel exhausted but that is exhilarating. The human mind is beautiful and wonderful. It will give me the willpower I need to power through. I have the why. The why is not to the best at what I do, or to win an award. The purpose is to celebrate what I&rsquo;ve become, to commemorate my Grandmother and share my works with others in becoming a better writer. In this respect, I have undoubtedly succeeded. There is nothing except amazement as I behold the efficacy in which I now write, thousands of words flowing through my keyboard every hour. Please, oh lord, give me even more of this divine power to continue writing. I haven&rsquo;t stopped yet and will not stop. Let me continue this craft for years upon years upon years into my earliest of days to my latest of nights and to emerge victorious and even greater as a writer, as I have done so. Let me get into the right perspective, feeling the power that flows in me and advice of adults that I will no longer be able to heed when I am older.</p><p>¬†</p><p>I rarely have the opportunity to be critqued on this level and am grateful. I get to be direct and ready to succeed in school and in life, the greatest challenge of all. I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m not pleased. I am so pleased, so amazed, so grateful in every regard as I sing praises to everyone who has ever supported me.</p><p>¬†</p><p>Thank you, friends, for being so supportive of me and sitting with me and gossiping through the deepest of strugges even in my darkest nights. Yvonne, I am so grateful to have you as a friend and be gifted your friendship in this wonderfully complicated life. I am truly grateful and so so happy. Thank you, Panda Express, for the delicious food that I would gladly slurp up again. Let me follow my dreams to become a better writer and perhaps make a book.</p><p>¬†</p><p>I&rsquo;m willing to do what it takes. So help me God.</p><p>¬†</p><p>Should I not be successful in this competition, I shall be through other means! There is always the AFSA essay contest, and editorial contest that I will enter excitedly later this year. So you see Braden, your opportunities are not limited. This is the greatest warm-up there is to competition, and making sure that you develop a unique voice to really nail down the arguments you need to nail. There is nobody else who is more suited to be in your position than you are. You have the entire school rooting for you, a family rooting for you, tutors rooting for you, and the list goes on and on. Please, do not stress but instead by elated to pursue your dreamin becoming a better writer.</p><p>¬†</p><p>I rejoice at this opportunity to learn and become even stronger. I look at this pile of words and marvel that there is this much content within me. It is with only excitement that I pursue the next story with a raging ambition. I will keep on writing until the worst of words are uttered, and so that the best of best words will be uttered. I will make sure that there is great care taken for all of my resources.</p><p>¬†</p><p>I am so grateful for everything. Oh gosh, why do I ever fret about the ordinary? There is nothing wrong with being me, in this world which supports and loves me, and allows me to write as many words as necessary to feel comfortable. Let me keep raging in this outpour, marvelling at the voice which I shall add to and build upon in every day.</p><p>¬†</p><p>I just noticed I was anxious to check my messages with tutors. Let&rsquo;s be honest. This is performance anxiety at its finest. But why? There is no fear in performing, I will for sure be a great performer. I am set and prepared to be the person I need to be and that is the person I shall become. I am so happy! Please oh please recognize this and pursue it, Braden. Recognize your passion to fervently write about yourself and commemorate Grandma and your friends and everyone else who has ever helped you along your literary journey and make it worth it! Get their signatures and make them super happy. Trust that they will be able to be here and be on top of your submissions! Gosh, I am such a guy. Let&rsquo;s keep writing, all night long, with this newfound energy and approach to get on top of my work and feel myself out. I am in the process of personal discovery, talking in abstractions as other artists who know their craft well are able to critique me. There will be a day where I no longer will be the critiqued, but the critiquer, as I already have found myself in. I simply pursue prestige.</p><p>¬†</p><p>Braden, you don&rsquo;t need prestige. And honestly, I am okay if I don&rsquo;t get anything. I am okay if I don&rsquo;t get anything. I am okay if I don&rsquo;t win anything. I am okay if I don&rsquo;t get to show off anything. I am okay if there is nothing for me to earn. I have gained everything that I needed. Most importantly, the lack of need to perform is most liberating. I am in the perfect position to continue bettering myself. There is no expectation or pressure. If I fail, life continues as normal and nobody remembers the time I was in Starbucks, or perhaps fretting, or perhaps out of school. Meanwhile, I have gained the experience of a lifetime.</p><p>¬†</p><p>I don&rsquo;t need anything. I want everything. And this want is the distinction between me and everyone else. That my desire to be the best, but not necessity to be so, will keep me in the strongest and most impenetrable of positions. This is why I am meant to lead in the front. This is why I am a true alpha. This is why I was meant to write.</p><p>¬†</p><p>And so Braden, when you write tonight, summon the energy of all your supporters and yourself in order to become the best writer there is, or at least best word-vomiter, or at least best editor, or at least best yourself. You are not beholden to anyone except yourself that you do your best and I have no doubt that you will do so. Your voice is unique, so use it.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3></h3><ul class=backlinks><li></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3></h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p></p><ul><li><a href=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/braden-w>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
