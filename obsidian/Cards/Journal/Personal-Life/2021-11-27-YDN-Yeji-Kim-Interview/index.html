We like to call ourselves “the commune” because we live together, and share responsibilities and possessions (mostly a ton of spicy snacks). Plus, we live in entryway D, so we combined these two identities into “DCommune”.</p><p>-“It was Halloween night.” Braden Wong wrote to the News. “We had just conceived the idea at 12:53 am. I told the lads I could probably get a prototype done by the end of the night—but I had left my computer in a friend’s suite.

It’s very awesome to see people using the program we made.”</p><p>-Concerning any future projects, Moin said that they have a wall of ideas and problems on the common room wall, and a new project currently in the works.</p><hr><p>Feel free to take on any questions and/or add on to responses someone already answered!</p><ol><li>What are your grade levels and what are your pronouns?</li></ol><p>Braden Wong, sophomore, he/him/his</p><p>David Peng, sophomore, he/him/his</p><p><a class="internal-link broken">Bilal</a>, sophomore, he/him/his</p><p>Sonny Nguyen, sophomore, he/him/his</p><ol start=2><li>Could you give some background as to what exactly the <a href=/quartz/obsidian/Cards/Journal/Personal-Life/Yale-Buttery-Book rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/obsidian/Cards/Journal/Personal-Life/Yale-Buttery-Book>Yale Buttery Book</a> app is?</li></ol><p>Could someone Insert our goal from the website here</p><p>Quite simply, if someone’s hungry at midnight, the problem was that</p><p>Our app compiles buttery times, menus, and recommendations for tasty items on a convenient platform.

In search of the sacred texts—the menu and hours of operation—we voyaged to the edges of Yale’s campus, from the extremities of Murray/Franklin to the backwaters of TD. Like good tourists, we left only footsteps and took only photographs. Like good gastronomers, we left (almost) no items unordered and sampled every regional speciality. And like good coders, we left no documentation unread and made only atomic commits.</p><p>Powered by Hopper’s Mozz Sticks, in protest of Gheav’s sandwich monopolism and eager to fill our empty git-contribution graphs, we compiled this compendium.</p><p>DCommune is proud to present: The Yale Buttery Book</p><p>Dedicated to all Yalies hungry at twilight.</p><ol start=4><li>How long did it take to develop the app?</li></ol><p>8 days, including coding, testing and compiling information - involved visiting all the butteries</p><ol start=5><li>Could you speak a bit about how the development process went?</li></ol><p>Braden: It was Halloween night. We had just conceived the idea at 12:53 am. I told the lads I could probably get a prototype done by the end of the night—but I had left my computer in a friend’s suite. Without second thought, <a class="internal-link broken">Bilal</a> raced in the pouring rain on his bike to get my computer. Together, we pulled a near all-nighter until we had a working user interface. It was so much fun.</p><p>Sonny: Coding didn’t take that long compared to the time it took to collect all the information and sample all the butteries ourselves to create food recommendations. We used all the resources and connections we could find to double check the hours—archived residential college websites, classmates in other colleges, Tinder matches.</p><ol start=6><li>Have you guys always had an interest in app development, or is this more of a recent interest?</li></ol><p>David: In the past, I’ve only worked on programming projects in an academic or research context, so Yale Buttery Book was the first app I’ve been a part of and it’s pretty new and exciting for me! Braden is a frontend god, I’ve learned a lot from working with him about app and web development frameworks and programs to continue toying with in the future.</p><ol start=7><li>How have you been advertising this app?</li></ol><p>David: We had been showing the work-in-progress to our friends at dinner, getting some feedback and initial reactions. When we felt we were really ready, we cleared our schedules one Thursday night to make final touches and send the official launch email—Thursday night because every buttery is open on Thursday! To get past the email limit set by gmail, each of us emailed a fourth of the undergrad student body. For future updates, we set up a DCommune email list and an Instagram page at @yalebutterybook!</p><p><a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=mailto:support@yalebutterybook.com>support@yalebutterybook.com</a></p><ol start=8><li>How many downloads do you have to date?</li></ol><p>Braden + David: So far, 6.6k people have visited the site and 401 have downloaded the app. We’re really grateful for the turnout, it’s beyond anything we could’ve hoped for.</p><ol start=9><li>How do you think the app has been functioning so far?</li></ol><p>David: One of the coolest experiences from making and releasing YBB has been hearing people around us casually use or mention it. There’s been instances where we’ve been with friends at night, the topic of butteries comes up, and someone nonchalantly just pulls up the site to check what’s open. It’s very awesome to see people using the program we made.</p><p><a class="internal-link broken">Bilal</a>: A testament to the success from the app is the feedback we’ve gotten from people through the app itself. We’ve got interested students and even buttery managers who suggested improvements and emailed newly-made digital versions of menus.</p><ol start=10><li>What are your goals for this app/any further plans for the future?</li></ol><p><a class="internal-link broken">Bilal</a>: We’re excited about the feedback for YBB. We believe there are a few interesting problems in Yale students’ life that could be improved with a cool app—we’ve literally got a wall of ideas on one side of our common room—and we have an exciting new project in the works.</p><p>David</p><ol start=11><li><p>What impact do you hope this app will have on the Yale community?</p></li><li><p>Anything else you would like to add?</p></li></ol></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3></h3><ul class=backlinks><li></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3></h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p></p><ul><li><a href=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/braden-w>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
