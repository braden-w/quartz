Why not cognitive scienceS
Well think about individuating sciences
Is there a science of mind, aerodynamics, and cryptography?‚ÜíNo
Natural alignment of our interests
Short past but a long history
William James‚ÜíWrote the first books of psychology, the Principles of Psychology, cool dude
Instinct Blindness‚ÜíThe deep-seated blindness from our own intuitions end up making us ignore essentials
Confucius quote about the commonplace
Perception is like a reflex
Examples
Black square with white background, but black square
Squares on the checkerboard are the same color
&ldquo;I hope you fucking appreciated that&rdquo;
Curing Instinct Blindness
in computational modeling‚ÜíWhen you have to implement a process, you rapidly find out how difficult it is (like Minsky or the compression problem)
in neuropsychology‚ÜíWhen healthy, the brain operates too seamlessly to recognize what&rsquo;s happening, but brain damage tears different processes apart
Intrinsic Scientific Reasons
Marr&rsquo;s 3 Levels
Marr&rsquo;s 3 Levels
Computational‚ÜíWhat is the problem being solved?
Algorithmic‚ÜíWhat are the steps used to solve it?
Implementation‚ÜíHow are those steps implemented in underlying hardware (biological or otherwise)?
Is each level critical? The different responses of philosophers
Jerry Fodor‚Üí"Who&rsquo;s to say we&rsquo;re a biological science?" More into Computational and Algorithmic<br>Paul Churchland‚ÜíNeuroscience is the way. More Implementation<br>All levels are critical!
You can&rsquo;t get away with only computation‚ÜíMany aspects of cognition can be explained only by nature of algorithm (e.g. afterimages)
You can&rsquo;t get away with only implementation‚ÜíCapturing generalizations (e.g. Microsoft Word, Comparative psychology, Computer vision)
How does the colored black and white image work?
Overlapping humps of photoreceptors for different colors (to enable balance of differentiation and recognition between colors)
Short medium long (RGB)
When light hits your eyes, it&rsquo;s transduced into photoreceptors</p><pre><code>--------------------- Portal ---------------------
</code></pre><p>&ndash; Avoided infinite recursion &ndash;<br>A general rule in science&mldr;is to seek an appropriate level of description.
The answer must be through multiple levels. You can&rsquo;t go through just one
Consider the circuitry of the Comodore 64. Looking just into the circuitry will show you nothing on cognition
You&rsquo;ll never be able to recognize patterns in circuitry, since the way different brains work are very different</p><p>Lecture 3 September 9th, 2021
Why all these disciplines?‚Üì
Natural alignment of our interests
Shortcuts to the truth
Intrinsic scientific reasons
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Portal &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
&ndash; Avoided infinite recursion &ndash; The right level of abstraction
The problem with the Connectome example‚ÜíSeeing the wirings of the brains won&rsquo;t give us understanding
We&rsquo;ve had the full connectome of other organisms (e.g. C. Elegans for about 35 years)
Complete brain circuit diagram has been mapped out, but has not given us understanding
Structure from Motion
The globe with a bunch of horizontal oscillating orbs looks like it&rsquo;s spinning counterclockwise
Structure from Motion Theorem‚ÜíIt&rsquo;s impossible to see structure unless you see 3 views of at least 4 (non0coplanar points)
Cognitive Architecture
name inspired from‚ÜíComputer architecture
inspiration‚ÜíBreak down mind into fundamental operations
Ideas that comes from computer science
Basic memory
Fundamental operations
Brute constraints
Examples
Synaesthesia‚ÜíMixing colors and numbers
People with Synaesthesia can see a bunch of 2&rsquo;s in a field of 5&rsquo;s instantly
It&rsquo;s an automatic reflex and is innate in them
It&rsquo;s an actual difference in Cognitive Architecture
If we color the numbers differently, we can see it stand out
Gender differences‚ÜíReal, balanced, &ldquo;significant&rdquo;, nuanced differences between men and women
examples
men are better at 3D rotations
women are better at pointing at general direction of different foods at farmers&rsquo; market
the error rate was negatively correlated to caloric value‚Üípeople remembered high-calorie foods (like olive oil) way better than lower calorie ones (like lettuce)
Different speeds of time‚ÜíTime goes at different rates
example‚Üíthe dot that flashes for equal lengths, but the period in which it grows seems to slow down time
People have different clock speeds
Balint&rsquo;s syndrome‚ÜíThey can only see one thing at a time
They can&rsquo;t tell the difference in length between 2 lines | |
They can tell the difference in lengths of two sides of a quadrilateral though
Strong vs. weak equivalence
Deep Blue and Kasparov
Kasparov | If the computer makes the same move that I make but for completely different reasons, has it still made an intelligent move?
Related to theGettier Case Example
Error analysis‚ÜíDo both systems make the same mistakes in the same situations?
Complexity Analysis‚ÜíDo both systems take equally long to process same set of inputs</p><p>Lecture 4 September 14th, 2021
Nature vs. Nurture
It is the Worse-than-Useless Question
the crucial point‚ÜíInnate structure is designed to learn!
Like language acquisition. You innately expect there to be nouns and verbs , in the same way that The bees innately have a notion of the sun, and that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, and know the path of the sun in the sky
Bees shake their butts
They know where the sun is in the sky, even when the sun is occluded
Scientists controlled when bees were able to see the sun
The bees innately have a notion of the sun, and that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, and know the path of the sun in the sky
Identical twins reared together vs apart
Heritability‚ÜíThe proportion of phenotypical variance that you can attribute to genetic variance
It is a measure of variance
When we refer to Heritability of height, it doesn&rsquo;t measure height in the first place, but the difference of height in the first place
Does not necessarily imply that there is a gene for it
What is the heritability of having a nose?‚ÜíApproximately 0
What is the heritability of wearing earrings?‚ÜíNot zero
If it was 100% among women, then within women, there is no heritability (it is like having a nose). Within men and women, there is a heritability of 1 (we can directly attribute to traits)
What is the heritability of wearing earrings circa 1950 in the US?‚ÜíEven higher than What is the heritability of wearing earrings?
T or F: Higher heritability ‚áí more likely to be inherited‚ÜíFalse
T or F: Higher heritability ‚áí less modifiable‚ÜíFalse
The Bell Curve
Controversial, the logic
Across white kids, intelligence is highly heritably
Across black kids, intelligence is highly heritable
Black kids have lower test scores
Murray then attributes the result to lower IQ among black people
Best rebuke is from the The two flower populations example
Conservativism Example
Counter to what we expect, conservatism is Heritability
MZT (Monozygotic Twins)
DZT (Dizygotic Twins)
MZT (Monozygotic Twins) and DZT (Dizygotic Twins) are close in levels of conservatism until around 25 years old, then huge disparities in conservatism afterwards
You stay the same as you grow up
It&rsquo;s after you go to school that you become what you grow into what youHeritability to be in conservatism
Heritability cannot be contrasted across populations:
The two flower populations example
1 is given lots of good soil and sunlight
height varies from result
conclusion‚ÜíYou can have height (or another property) highly Heritability among two populations, but have drastic diferent outcomes across them due to environment
The plant example for Heritability
Takeaways‚ÜíHeritability is only comparable within populations and not across populations

Exploring Nature
Identical twins reared apart
Precocious infant cognition
Newborn babies spend more time looking/engaging with :) faces than scrambled faces, suggesting that there is an innate inborn desire for scrambled faces
Poverty of the stimulus arguments
There&rsquo;s not enough stimulus to explain the preference of regular faces over scrambled faces
It&rsquo;s possible that adding stimulus desensitizes us to them rather than makes us more sensitive to them
Preferential Looking‚ÜíShow monkeys several pictures at once, and see which one they spend more time looking at (alarm clocks vs. other humans)
Visual Paired-Comparisons‚ÜíShow monkeys several pictures
Deprived monkey experiment
Deprived monkeys were not exposed to human faces as they were being fed, others were
Deprived monkeys could spot differences among humans better
conclusion‚ÜíExposure leads us to prune away things that we get used to
Regarding language: we are born able to discern all sounds, but they are pruned away
Learning plays the role of pruning away abilities of human nature, rather than adding them
The cataract curing blindness for the first time study, asking questions to people once they see for the first time
T or F: Do they fall for the same visual illusions (i.e. which line is longer)‚ÜíT
conclusion‚ÜíWhatever&rsquo;s responsible for visual illusions are innate to human nature/genetic endowment
The universal assumption of light source of top
this is wired into many animals
examples
The 2 by 3 matrix of dimples and pop outs
Flipping pictures of asteroid craters gives completely different results because we still think the light source is on the top
Countershading‚ÜíMost animals are darker on the top and white on the bottom. This is because of the The universal assumption of light source of top .
Neurodevelopment disorders
Cultural Universality
Visual cliff example
Innateness
Why innateness?
Learning takes time
Uniformity
Common misconceptions about Innateness
&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not preset at birth, it must be learned from environment"‚ÜíNot true, consider puberty
&ldquo;Innate cognitive mechanisms have no need for input from environment"‚ÜíNot true, innate senses need to be trained (consider bees)
Pieces of Mind (Modularity - More like Magic of the mind)
Ubiquity of specialization (you usually can be really good at one thing, but not both)
At the molecular level
Hemoglobin transports oxygen
Rhodopsin tranduces light to electricty
Anatomical Level
Heart pumps blood
Liver detoxifies poisons
The question‚ÜíDoes this work on the behavioral level?
Modularity - More like Magic
The shepherd&rsquo;s paradox
Two benches look completely different even though the parallelogram on the topics is the same
This is an example of Foreshortening and Modularity - More like Magic
You know that it&rsquo;s shade of gray, but you cannot penetrate the Modularity - More like Magic of the thought process because it&rsquo;s taken all at once across multiple processes
Informational encapsulation‚ÜìThe inside cannot see out. Processing internal to the module can&rsquo;t access external information
covers‚Üímental reflexes
Lack of access to &lsquo;interlevels&rsquo;‚ÜíThe outside cannot see in. Processing outside the module can&rsquo;t access the intermediate output
explains‚ÜíInstinct Blindness
symptoms or characterizations of
Fast processing‚ÜíYou can&rsquo;t even recognize how you&rsquo;re processing (think of faces, how can you tell these things?)
Why?
encapsulation‚ÜíCircumscribed database
mandatoriness‚ÜíNo need to decide if or when to respond, it&rsquo;s just instant
The frame problem
Characteristic breakdown
example‚Üíman with stroke who speaks perfect English but completely incoherent. Information stored in chunks or modules
Does cognitive modularity ‚Äîimply‚Üí neural modularity?
Domain Specificity‚ÜìWhat do you plan on doing in the first place
Domain Specificity is not the same as Encapsulation
Encapsulation‚Üíwhat do you have access to?
Domain is more releated to algorithimic level while Encapsulation is more related to more computational
Face recognition/face percep and ntion
You can recognize people without eyes but with eyebrows better than vice versa
Morph‚ÜîThe human face slowly morphs into a really inhuman version
We have hidden subtle things that allow us to perceive faces
Prosopagnosics‚ÜîThere are people who can understand faces but cannot recognize them
On the other hand, there are others who can recognize people just fine, but can&rsquo;t recognize people
Superrecognizers‚ÜîThere are some people who are super good at recognizing faces | Scholl&rsquo;s wife

Lecture 9 September 30th, 2021
The accidental car crash vs. intentional murder
This exercise illustrates an age-old legal principle, encapsulated in the phrase ‚Äúactus non facit reum nisimens sit rea‚Äù, meaning, ‚Äòan act is not guilty unless the mind is guilty‚Äô.
Mind Body Problem | nobody knows lmao
5 Steps of Evolution
Reproductive Math | geometric growing population
Crunch time | finite resources and has population that is too large
Nonrandomness | who survives is not a lottery
Inheritance | any bias advantage would be amplified over time
If a mutant produces just 11% more offspring than its rivals, it can represent its representation in the population from .1% to 99.9% in just over 4000 generations
A pessimistic estimate of the time required for an eye to evolve
Rate of adaptation is more related to need rather than difficulty of development
The layers of the eye was simulated and then left to evolve in conditions
Eyes kept on evolving
The entire sequence took only about 400,000 generations
Vertebrate eyes evolved some 40-60 times independently from each other
Neuroscientific Methods
fMRI
Methods
Examples
Limitations
Using microscope
first, we need to make the brain flat , so we suspend it in preservant and slice it into thin slices
Patient H.M.
had anterograde amnesia
brain was dissected Using microscope
When patients played so much tetris, had an observed tetris effect
an example that memories were still being encoded , but could not be indexed
Histology‚ÜîTake it apart and look, attempt to map out highways
Tools we use
Stains (which can be used to help map out highways)
Make brain tissue transparent, and then inject different color stains
There&rsquo;s some parts where you can stimulate in thebrain that help you start feeling or moving
Naked role mats have a bunch of sensors dedicated just to teeth
Lecture 10 October 5th, 2021
Single-Cell Recording
Solution | Put an electrode in or on a single neuron
In = difficult
On = easy but noisy
Receptive fields
Neuronal Specialization‚ÜîWe can identify different neurons specialized
examples
Location
Contrast
Orientation
Color
Motion
Biological motion
Even faces!
At the Implementation level, there are neurons dedicated to each representation

Taking
EEGs
Reflect overal global brain activity
Lots of noise
ERPs‚ÜîAverage lots of EEGs to cancel Lots of noise
Lecture 11 October 7th, 2021 Brian Scallentini
Brian&rsquo;s favorite robot‚ÄïSausage sorter
Evokative objects
Sit at the border of many cateogrical decisions
Allow us to investigate boundary conditions
Robots are important because they are Evokative objects
Robot that just generated random noises, but children believe they&rsquo;re teaching it to say truck #Example
Investigating Embodiment
How many undergrads would take the textbooks in a faculty room, and throw them in the trash, just because a robot told you
Conclusion‚ÄïEmbodiment (physical presence) increases compliance
Robot
Cheating to win vs. cheating to lose and response</p><p>Lecture 12 October 12th, 2021
fMRI‚ÜíFunctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
advantages
Safe
Noninvasive
Repeated and extended use
No special preparation
Great resolution
does not measure brain activity, but blood flow in the brain
How it works
Spin
Magnetic part‚ÜíIn a magnetic field, the axis of spinning protons align themselves based on field
RF Pulses
Blood flow‚ÜíSee oxygen depletion
Increased activity‚ÜíSudden oxygen depletion‚ÜíOver replenished a few seconds later
Blood and magnetism
Measurement
When you use a brain, increased blood flow
More oxygen and hemogloben
Less susceptibility to magnetic field
Slower proton precession back to normal
Longer precession period
Stronger field signal!
Subtraction method‚ÜíWhat regions of the brain are active when thinking about x vs. y? We then see the difference between regions and x and y to get conclusion
How long does it take to perceive color?
Morality
Emotions are involved in ethical dilemmas #<a class="internal-link broken">Experimental Study</a>
Comparing trolley problem
Classification
Add Classification Image to androgenous base image
We don&rsquo;t detect gender based off most facial features, but by the eyes (the classification image was mostly an eye shaped one)</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3></h3><ul class=backlinks><li></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3></h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p></p><ul><li><a href=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/braden-w>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
