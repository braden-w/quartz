Monkeys who figured trap 1 used same strategy on trap 2
Can trial and error, but not understand causal chain
Dogs have inferential reasoning‚Äïthey can learn to open doors with the presence of humans to train/demonstrate how to open
Central Tenet of Experimental Psychology‚ÄïAll behavior potentially explained by multiple psych. mechanisms
Behavior
Mech 1
Mech 2
Mech 3
Mech 4
Evolution definition in terms of allele‚Äïchange in allele frequency over time
Cognition‚ÄïFlexibility, mental flexibility, mental trial and error
Tinbergen 4 levels analysis for biological traits
Phylogenetic (Phylem) - species
Ontogenetic (Path) - developmental paths
Functional (Payoff of trait) - what does it allow you to do?
Proximate (Mechanism) - how does it work?
4 levels do not compete, but help reveal each other
Dog Pointer Experiment vs. Chimps
Dogs understand gestures
Use rock to point to right one, dogs get right but not Chimps
Puppies can understand human gestures/novel markers as 6 weeks, while wolves do not have that ability, even when raised by humans
Empathy is demonstrated early by contagious yawning
Bonobos‚ÄïGood-willed and prefer to share w/ strangers
Closer relatives than chimps, but have none of the dark traits of humans and chimps
They selected towards interested/less violent males, perhaps due to matriarchy
Contagious yawning demonstrates social behavior
Philosophy
Emotivism‚Äïmoral judgements from emotion
Knowledge (classical account)‚ÄïKnowledge is true belief, and requires truth
Gettier Case Example‚Äï
Stopped Clock - Bertrand Russell
Sheep Framer Sees
Actually thought true, and thought true, but not through understanding or intuition, but luck
Raise question - If true belief is justified, is it still Knowledge (classical account)?
Radical skeptic‚Äïwe know very little
Brain-in-vat hypo
Why Obey Law? Theory
Benefit - Obligated because we benefit
Consent
Fairness
Philosophical anarchism‚Äïno obligation to follow the law
Believing or not believing miracles (testimonies)
Hume
Hume&rsquo;s Definition of a miracle‚Äïa violation of natural law
The evidence in favor of a miracle will always be outweighed by the evidence for the law of nature
Reid

        Chinese Room‚ÄïMachines control syntax, but not semantics

Context‚ÄïCircumstances that form the setting for group communication
Pluralism‚ÄïThe idea that there are many social worlds and constructs

Scale‚ÄïSmall group vs. big group in communication
    The Boulder City Council is planning a public meeting to discuss how to manage and develop a new parcel of open space land that the City of Boulder recently acquired. This is an important public issue and many people have strong opinions about what to do--or not do--with the land. The City Council wants citizen input, but there are so many people interested in this issue that it will be impossible to involve everyone at a public meeting. So the City Council creates a &quot;citizen's input panel&quot; made up of ten Boulder residents who will gather input from the entire community and represent these interests to the City Council in a report to be presented at the upcoming public meeting.

Presenteeism vs Absenteeism‚ÄïPresenteeism is less productive but more traditional

        Dummy variables‚Äïa variable that takes two values, generally one or zero
            a much better way of using categorical variables in regression
            add one dummy variable for one less than the number of unique values in the categorical variable  
            if the variable is binary, you'd add one dummy
            if there are four categories, you'd add three dummy variables.

            Heap‚ÄïA binary tree that is a complete binary tree (aka heap)
            Height‚ÄïThe maximum number of edges, not nodes
                A tree with only one node has height  0

                    runtime‚Äïbased off the height of the tree but also how many children per node (to be compared), or O( n\log n  )
                    Used in  extractMax  to replace root node with last leaf and let it sift down the tree
                SiftUp‚ÄïStart from bottom node and work up
                    runtime‚Äïbased off the height of the tree, or O( \log n  )

The Essentials of Global Health
Intro / Global Terms
Social determinant‚ÄïThe conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live and age and the wider set of forces in systems shaping the conditions of daily life.
Direct determinants of health‚ÄïSex, genetics, etc.

neonatal mortality rate‚ÄïNumber of deaths to infants under 28 days of age in a given year per 1,000 live births in that year
As countries get better developed and people live longer in them, neonatal deaths represent a greater fraction of all under five child deaths

Big History
Stars
Population 1
luminous, they&rsquo;re hot, they&rsquo;re young, and metal-rich
Population 2
older, less luminous, cooler, colder, metal-poor
Massive stars live fast and die young
Planets
Formed gently
Planetary formations past the ice belt enable formations of large gas giants
Jupiter&rsquo;s rampage into the asteroid belt theory
Explains why
Mars is smaller than normal (Jupiter threw away a lot of material)
No planets near the asteroid belt (the materials there are moving way too quickly to form a planet)
The only thing that stopped was the resonance of Jupiter and Saturn
Hundreds of mars-sized protoplanets in the early solar system, only 4 survived and others were ejected
Earth Moon System
Collision of protoplanet with Earth, causing melting of Earth
Peculiar characteristics
Extraordinary amount of angular momentum
Moon was molten sometime in its history
Earth is water, Moon is bone dry
Chemical and material similarites from Earth
The Earth
Earth is extraordinarily dense
Volume calculated in ancient times, mass extrapolated from gravity
density = 5.5 tons/cubic meter, but crust is much less dense than this
Deep earth must be very dense
Study of shockwaves through
Slow waves through only solid
Stopped at 2900 km, indicating change to liquid
Fast waves through solid and liquid
Humans
Collective learning means that humans have acquired more and more information about their environments
Over time, hominin ancestors became increasingly less sexually dimorphic
One key cognitive difference between humans and chimpanzees‚Äï
Humans have better abilities to imitate and learn by imitation. Allows more than one teacher, uncles and aunts and etc.
Collective learning‚Äïability of a species to accumulate more information with each passing generation than is lost by the next.
Nomads
Palaeolithic‚ÄïNomad, characterized by stone tools
Humans have been foragers for approximately 95 % of their history.
What are the four world zones?
Afro-Eurasia
Australasia
Pacific Islands
Americas
Future
Climate Change
Temperatures have only risen about a degree since the Industrial Revolution
