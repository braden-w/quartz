Deworming
Depression
Give Directly
When there is food on the table, there are many problems. When there is no food on the table, there is only one.

2. Crowding out, comparative advantage, but the inherent unfairness of careers</p><p>Animal Welfare | Factory FarmingJuly 1st, 2020
Why It&rsquo;s Time to End Factory Farming - Quillette
Think about the horses who were replaced by cars. Cars do the same thing horses do‚Äîthey move people from one place to another‚Äîbut without all the crap.
Farming is inefficent, at a ratio of ~1/10
Factory farming: 99% in US, 90% globally
Equality for Animals?
Comparison to how slavery was treated as normal
We are used to regarding the oppression of blacks and women as among the most important moral and political issues facing the world today. These are serious matters, worthy of the time and energy of any concerned person. But animals? Surely the welfare of animals is in a different category altogether, a matter for old ladies in tennis shoes to worry about. How can anyone waste their time on equality for animals when so many humans are denied real equality?
This attitude reflects a popular prejudice against taking the interests of animals seriously - a prejudice no better founded than the prejudice of white slaveowners against taking the interests of blacks seriously. It is easy for us to criticize the prejudices of our grandfathers, from which our fathers freed themselves. It is more difficult to distance ourselves from our own beliefs, so that we can dispassionately search for prejudices among them. What is needed now is a willingness to follow the arguments where they lead, without a prior assumption that the issue is not worth attending to.
Would experimenters be prepared to perform their experiments on orphaned humans with severe and irreversible brain damage if that were the only way to save thousands? ( I say &lsquo;orphaned&rsquo; in order to avoid the complication of the feelings of the human parents.) If experimenters are not prepared to use orphaned humans with severe and irreversible brain damage, their readiness to use nonhuman animals seems to discriminate on the basis of species alone, since apes, monkeys, dogs, cats and even mice and rats are more intelligent, more aware of what is happening to them, more sensitive to pain, and so on, than many brain-damaged humans barely surviving in hospital wards and other institutions. There seems to be no morally relevant characteristic
Capacity for suffering
If I give a horse a hard slap across its rump with my open hand, the horse may start, but it presumably feels little pain. Its skin is thick enough to protect it against a mere slap. If I slap a baby in the same way, however, the baby will cry and presumably does feel pain, for its skin is more sensitive. So it is worse to slap a baby than a horse, if both slaps are administered with equal force. But there must be some kind of blow - I don&rsquo;t know exactly what it would be, but perhaps a blow with a heavy stick - that would cause the horse as much pain as we cause a baby by slapping it with our hand. That is what I mean by &rsquo;the same amount of pain&rsquo; and if we consider it wrong to inflict that much pain on a baby for no good reason then we must, unless we are speciesists, consider it equally wrong to inflict the same amount of pain on a horse for no good reason.
Benjamin Franklin Objection
&lsquo;Well&rsquo;, Franklin said to himself, &lsquo;if you eat one another, I don&rsquo;t see why we may not eat you&rsquo;
objections to the Ben Franklin Objection
Most animals that kill for food would not be able to survive if they did not, whereas we have no need to eat animal flesh.
It is odd that humans should, when it suits them, use an argument that implies we ought to look to animals for moral guidance.
Nonhuman animals are not capable of considering the alternatives open to them or of reflecting on the ethics of their diet.
The Use of Mental Defectives
also known as‚Äï&ldquo;the argument from marginal cases&rdquo;
Counterarguments
Mental defectives who don&rsquo;t possess the capacities of normal humans should nevertheless be treated as if they did possess these capacities, since they belong to a species which typically possesses them
Although mental defectives may not possess higher capacities than other animals, they are nonetheless human beings
Slippery slope&rsquo; argument
Discussion
Pain is suffering, suffering is optional.
Decreasing demand is good but may not necessarily have the desired effect on supply
Halving demands doesn&rsquo;t necessarily result in twice as much space per animal, but the same amount and half the size of factories
The optimal strategy is not to only decrease the demand of factory farmed meat (which may have an unintended consequence on supply) but to increase the demand of ethically treated meat (which guarantees an intended consequence on supply)
Chicken sexers
Domestic sheep don&rsquo;t stop growing wool. Suppose we banned everything; would they all die off?
The ideal outcome is coexistence that is mutually beneficial to both of us, like dogs
Is it an evolutionary win to be factory farmed?
There are more chickens now than have ever been before
If we could help create them, feed them, and give them painless deaths, it could be great
If there is a way to reduce suffering in transit from beginning to end, that sounds like an optimal strategy
