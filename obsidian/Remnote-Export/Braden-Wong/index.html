            Terminology
                Deep Recursion‚Üísearch within lists of list. In our base case, we will need to check if the first element is a  list 
                Symbols‚Üíanything that starts with ', or an operator
                Iteration vs. Recursion Processes
                    Iterative process‚Üíonly one recursive call of procedure at each level without further processing
                        indentations in trace function? (yes/no)‚Üíno

                    Recursive process‚Üímore than one recursive call at any level OR there is additional computation done before recursive call
                        indentations in trace function? (yes/no)‚Üíyes

                    Convert from recursive to iterative‚Üíadd an extra argument, put computation in that argument instead of outside the recursive call
                        example‚Üíhttps://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/eIoDZkP8ihSaohumljnCAELY9b1EAbb24Y_WalpEC9kgshpLxrr5Ng4qwXs1aUAuF98vVN1EugKKGoE7CS5isiTnzMePspafY57C1ADEri0T-T3KWluZ3vR22R7kdvWW
                    The biggest difference between recursive and iterative?‚Üírecursive places computation outside the called function, while iterative does computation within the called function's argument
                Procedures vs. processes‚Üíprocedures generate processes
                Tail recursive sequences‚Üírecursive procedures that generate iterative processes
                    how to tell they're tail recursive‚Üíall calculation is done in argument, not outside
                    tail= tuck

                How to approach truth table
                    1. Find all the true values in the output column
                    2. Write Boolean expressions for the corresponding rows https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/62FAvcBvKxsd54aKw9KotWZU9QwTa6Ps1uIcb6bN_1DuV2U3Z5jk9kvWQw5t2pwz9fXcom-JSIzTOBESvXX8KOnvkLHDBQ_Bis4nTMbN8oKIu2PwBSHrZ-_gTw1wFkyK  
                    3. Add these expressions together to get your final sum of products: (x‚Äô*y*z)+(x*y‚Äô*z)+(x*y*z‚Äô)+(x*y*z)

                            Let's create a new sub-goal from this table: design a circuit so that we always have q=u'
                                We need to remove the row where x,y=0, which would give us the followinghttps://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/8vWaVRpvJh6w49oeKpwxA-DaCbjX_Cnv0KMOpc6DQvQ5HbQlssD33gSK9uHm__DTG5u-OKZdoLG6-j3szOoPan3mwmJtGJBQcmpA7D2f2ctq3DqSjXz9KqfA8zjgto1b  
                                    note that when x,y=1, there are two equally stable outputs: q=0 and q=1
                                    once the system enters a state where x,y=1, the value of q will stay as the value before and become stable  . This is the key to designing a circuit with memory

                        The Memory Address Register (MAR)  in this example holds 2 bits to represent all four possible addresses, feeding it to the decoder.
                        The decoder sends out a yes to one of the four streams to the memory registers  
                        For each register, the output of the decoder is AND'd with each bit of each Memory Register (aka register), and the output of these ANDs are OR'd

                    The¬†main difference¬†between 1‚Ä≤ s complement and 2‚Ä≤ s complement is that 1‚Ä≤ s complement has two representations of 0 (zero) ‚Äì 00000000, which is positive zero (+0) and 11111111, which is negative zero (-0); whereas in 2‚Ä≤ s complement, there is only one representation for zero ‚Äì 00000000 (+0) because if we add 1 to 11111111 (-1), we get 00000000 (+0) which is the same as positive zero. This is the reason why 2‚Ä≤ s complement is generally used.
                    Another difference is that while adding numbers using 1‚Ä≤ s complement, we first do binary addition, then add in an end-around carry value. But, 2‚Ä≤ s complement has only one value for zero, and doesn‚Äôt require carry values.

                Lists
                    Representing a list
                        Start the list with two memory locations: one indicating that this is a pointer, the second giving the address of the first cell
                        Cons Cells
                            Requires  4  continuous memory locations:  2  for the left hand and  2  for the right hand box (Pair of memory locations)
                            Left hand and right hand (Pairs of 2)
                                First address contains code:
                                    0: Box is data
                                    1: Box is pointer
                                    -1: This is the empty list
                                Second address contains data, pointer, or is irrelevant
                    Sample List (Notice the first x0 and x1 is a pointer to the start of the list)
                        x0: 110:     1

                Car and Cdr
                    car represents the first half of a cons cell
                    cdr represents the second half of a cons cell
                    set-car! sets the first half of a cons cell
                    set-cdr! sets the second half of a cons cell
                        set-cdr! a creates a in the second half of the cons cell, but set-cdr! '(a) creates a pointer to that list in the cons cell
                        cdr is often a pointer of the first element of a list
                cdr is a pointer which points to another car (consult notebook)

        English 011: Lincoln in Thought and Action
            Retrogression
            August 31st, 2020
                 On the Duty of Civil Disobedience
                    But a government in which the majority rule in all cases can not be based on justice, even as far as men understand it.
                    If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of government, let it go, let it go: perchance it will wear smooth,‚Äîcertainly the machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself, then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be a counter friction to stop the machine. What I have to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to the wrong which I condemn.
                The Liberator: &quot;To the Public&quot;
                    topic‚Äïa strong condemnation of slavery
                    what he did‚Äïpublished and made speeches against slavery
                        In Park-street Church, on the Fourth of July, 1829, in an address on  slavery, I unreflectingly assented to the popluar but pernicious  doctrine of gradual abolition. I seize this opportunity to make a full  and unequivocal recantation, and thus publicly to ask pardon of my God,  of my country, and of my brethren the poor slaves, for having uttered a  sentiment so full of timidity, injustice and absurdity. A similar  recantation, from my pen, was published in the Genius of Universal  Emancipation at Baltimore, in September, 1829. My consicence in now  satisfied.
                    why severe language‚Äïyou do not do things half-heartedly
                        I am aware, that many object to the severity of my language; but is there not cause for severity? I will  be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this  subject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write, with moderation.  No! no! Tell a man whose house is on fire, to give a moderate alarm;  tell him to moderately rescue his wife from the hand of the ravisher;  tell the mother to gradually extricate her babe from  the fire into  which it has fallen;  -- but urge me not to use moderation in a cause  like the present. I am in earnest -- I will not equivocate -- I will not  excuse -- I will not retreat a single inch -- AND I WILL BE HEARD. The apathy of the people is enough to make every statue leap from its pedestal, and to hasten the resurrection of the dead.
                    Lincoln realizes that the United States is different because it has  no native people 
                    the mob has a tendency to positive feedback loop destabilization, you either become with the mob or fragmented from the government
                    Proposition‚Äïan indicative statement that is falsifiable
                        Lincoln says that the nation was founded on the proposition of  all men are created equal  
                    he is calling for cancelling passion
                    to change the system, play by the system
                        bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as possible, still while they continue in force, for the sake of example, they should be religiously observed  
                Address to the People of Sangamon County

                    calls for‚Äïactive government and improvement
                Lyceum Address
                    As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.  
                    describes as‚Äïordinary people
                        a set of men, certainly not following for a livelihood, a very useful, or very honest occupation; but one which, so far from being forbidden by the laws, was actually licensed by an act of the Legislature, passed but a single year before. Next, negroes, suspected of conspiring to raise an insurrection, were caught up and hanged in all parts of the State: then, white men, supposed to be leagued with the negroes; and finally, strangers, from neighboring States, going thither on business, were, in many instances subjected to the same fate. Thus went on this process of hanging, from gamblers to negroes, from negroes to white citizens, and from these to strangers; till, dead men were seen literally dangling from the boughs of trees upon every road side; and in numbers almost sufficient, to rival the native Spanish moss of the country, as a drapery of the forest  
                    a group of lawless in spirit‚Äïby such examples, by instances of the perpetrators of such acts going unpunished, the lawless in spirit, are encouraged to become lawless in practice; and having been used to no restraint, but dread of punishment, they thus become, absolutely unrestrained.
                    notably, Abraham lincoln discounts the situation through‚Äïcompleting the audience's thoughts
                        You are, perhaps, ready to ask, &quot;What has this to do with the perpetuation of our political institutions?&quot; I answer, it has much to do with it 
                        But, it may be asked, why suppose danger to our political institutions? Have we not preserved them for more than fifty years? And why may we not for fifty times as long?  
                        The hanging of the gamblers was of little consequence
                        The African Americans, had they not met their fate at the mob, would have met a similar fate at the hands of the law
                    the reason that either side can fall into anarchy‚Äïthe desire of distinction, whether through enslavement or abolition
                    the introduction of religion/higher being‚Äïlet us have an attachment and respect to the law, let us lay down as a political religion, specifically in a democracy
                        why this is specifically important in democracy‚Äïthe mechanism through which democracy garners power is shared through that that powers mobs

                 Speech on the Mexican War - Teaching American History
                    The &quot;spot&quot; resolutions were to ask Polk where the &quot;spot&quot; of Mexican aggression was
                    What, in the name of all that is sacred, was the President to do but  exactly what he did do ‚Äì move our army to the extreme limit of our  boundary, and there await the onslaught, if Mexico chose to make it?
                    Well, where does the shoe pinch here, gentlemen? Are you horrified at the success of the American arms? I verily believe that many of you would have been better pleased if the results of this war had been the defeat of our armies and a loss of American territory, and more especially if it had secured the defeat of the dominant party.
                    Here we are in the second week of this short session, denouncing the President for causing an unholy, impious, and vindictive war, and cavilling and carping at the manner in which he has protected the Mexican people who have yielded to the resistless shock of our victorious arms.

                Henry Clay
                    Of antithesis, and elegant  arrangement of words and sentences; but rather of that deeply  earnest and impassioned tone, and manner  
                    Deep devotion to the cause of human liberty  
                    Missouri compromise
                        Mr. Clay was in congress, and, perceiving the danger, at once  engaged his whole energies to avert it. It began, as I have said,  in 1819; and it did not terminate till 1821. Missouri would not  yield the point; and congress -- that is, a majority in congress -- by  repeated votes, showed a determination to not admit the state  unless it should yield. After several failures, and great labor on  the part of Mr. Clay to so present the question that a majority  could consent to the admission, it was, by a vote, rejected, and as  all seemed to think, finally. A sullen gloom hung over the nation.  All felt that the rejection of Missouri, was equivalent to a  dissolution of the Union, because those states which already had, what  Missouri was rejected for refusing to relinquish, would go with  Missouri. All deprecated and deplored this, but none saw how to  avert it. For the judgment of Members to be convinced of the  necessity of yielding, was not the whole difficulty; each had a  constituency to meet, and to answer to. Mr. Clay, though worn  down, and exhausted, was appealed to by members, to renew his  efforts at compromise. He did so, and by some judicious  modifications of his plan, coupled with laborious efforts with individual  members, and his own over-mastering eloquence upon the floor,  he finally secured the admission of the State. Brightly, and  captivating as it had previously shown, it was now perceived that  his great eloquence, was a mere embellishment, or, at most, but  a helping hand to his inventive genius, and his devotion to his  country in the day of her extreme peril.  
                    Divine Providence, ending is very religious  
                Speech on the Kansas Nebraska Act   Peoria Speech, October 16, 1854 - Lincoln Home National Historic Site (U.S. National Park Service)
                    response to‚ÄïDouglas
                    significance‚Äïhis most ambitious speech before presidency
                    self-interest (how Lincoln uses it)‚Äïselfishness
                    Near eighty years ago we began by declaring that all men are created  equal; but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration, that for some men to enslave others is a ‚Äòsacred right of self-government.‚Äô These principles can not stand together. They are as  opposite as God and mammon; and whoever holds to the one, must despise  the other.‚Äù
                    I trust I understand, and truly estimate the right of self-government. My faith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own,lies at the foundation of the sense of justice there is in me. I extend the principles to communities of men, as well as to individuals. I so extend it, because it is politically wise, as well as naturally just: politically wise, in saving us from broils about matters which do not concern us. Here, or at Washington, I would not trouble myself with the oyster laws of Virginia, or the cranberry laws of Indiana.
                    The doctrine of self government is right--absolutely and eternally right--but it has no just application, as here attempted. Or perhaps I should rather say that whether it has such just application depends upon whether a Negro is notor is a man. If he is not a man, why in that case, he who is a man may, as a matter of self-government, do just as he pleases with him. But if the Negro is a man, is it not to that extent, a total destruction of self-government, to say that he too shall not govern himself? When the white man governs himself, and also governs another man, that is more than self-government--that is despotism. If the Negro is a man, why then my ancient faith teaches me that ‚Äúall men are created equal;‚Äù and that there can be no moral right in connection with one man's making a slave of another
                    Judge Douglas frequently, with bitter irony and sarcasm,paraphrases our argument by saying ‚ÄúThe white people of Nebraska are good enough to govern themselves, but they are not good enough to govern a few miserable Negroes!!‚Äù
                    Well I doubt not that the people of Nebraska are, and will continue to be as good as the average of people elsewhere. I do not say the contrary. What I do say is, that no man is good enough to govern another man, without the other's consent.I say this is the leading principle--the sheet anchor of American republicanism. Our Declaration of Independence says:
                    ‚ÄúWe hold these truths to be self evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights,governments are instituted among men, DERIVING THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED.‚Äù
                    &quot;Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment, is not the sole question&quot;
                        Justice is justice, sound judgement is more utilitarian on the preservation of the Republican
                    He asks that they keep 1 for 1 or concessions so‚Äïthey stay on the table, tactical decision. You're giving us nothing?
                    I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself.  
                Letter to Speed
                    why roused?‚ÄïOf the one hundred members composing the two branches of that body, about seventy were democrats. These latter held a caucus, in which the Nebraska bill was talked of, if not formally discussed. It was thereby discovered that just three, and no more, were in favor of the measure. In a day of two Dougla's [sic] orders came on to have resolutions passed approving the bill; and they were passed by large majorities!!! The truth of this is vouched for by a bolting democratic member. The masses too, democratic as well as whig, were even, nearer unanimous [sic] against it; but as soon as the party necessity of supporting it, became apparent, the way the democracy began to see the¬†wisdom¬†and¬†justice¬†of it, was perfectly astonishing.
                    Difference between in practice and principle
                        principle‚Äïall men are created equal
                        practice‚Äïagainst extension of slavery
                 Lincoln Speech Text - Kalamazoo Valley Museum 
                    Can Nebraska, as a free state, somehow vote slavery in?
                        9 out of 10 people are free, 1 out of 10 is a slave holder. The mere 
                        Once slavery is in with a lot of free people, it will be planted and can become legitimate
                        Therefore, stopping the extension of slavery is the politically prudent option, as people won't opt for slavery if they're not used to it
                            Notably, this is not the moral option. The moral option is to end slavery, period
                        prudent vs moral option‚Äïprudent is in practice, moral is on principle

                 Speech at Springfield, June 26, 1857 - mrlincolnandfreedom.org
                    Utah's Self-Government
                        I begin with Utah. If it prove to be true, as is probable, that the  people of Utah are in open rebellion in the United States, then Judge  Douglas is in favor of repealing their territorial organization, and  attaching them to the adjoining States for judicial purposes. I say,  too, if they are in rebellion, they ought to be somehow coerced to  obedience; and I am not now prepared to admit or deny that the Judge‚Äôs  mode of coercing them is not as good as any. The Republicans can fall in  with it without taking back anything they have ever said. To be sure,  it would be a considerable backing down by Judge Douglas from his much  vaunted doctrine of self-government for the territories; but this is  only additional proof of what was very plain from the beginning, that  that doctrine was a mere deceitful pretense for the benefit of slavery.  Those who could not see that much in the Nebraska act itself, which  forced Governors, and Secretaries, and Judges on the people of the  territories, without their choice or consent, could not be made to see,  though one should rise from the dead to testify.
                        Criticizes democrats for hypocrisy in considering self-government for slavery but not for polygamy (double standard)
                            You have predetermined beliefs of what is right or wrong for polygamy, but no stance on slavery?
                    Criticizes judge douglas on allowing vote
                    Now I protest  against that counterfeit logic which concludes that, because I do not  want a black woman for a slave I must necessarily want her for a wife.  I need not have her for either, I can just leave her alone. In some  respects she certainly is not my equal; but in her natural right to eat  the bread she earns with her own hands without asking leave of any one  else, she is my equal, and the equal of all others.    
                    Hedging himself from strawman argumants- Wanting a black woman not as a slave but as a neighbor does not mean as a wife. Stating that we are equal does not mean we are all the same in all respects. Also note that we are not equal does not imply inferiority or superiority
                 &quot;House Divided&quot; Speech by Abraham Lincoln  (1858)
                    Prophetic tone, either we will end slavery or be ended. Considered to be quite controversial
                        Either the opponents of slavery, will arrest the further spread  of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief  that it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or its advocates will push  it forward, till it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old  as well as new -- North as well as South.
                        Then opened the roar of loose declamation in favor of &quot;Squatter  Sovereignty,&quot; and &quot;Sacred right of self-government.&quot;
                    &quot;But,&quot; said opposition members, &quot;let us be more specific -- let us  amend the bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the  territory may exclude slavery.&quot; &quot;Not we,&quot; said the friends of the  measure; and down they voted the amendment.   
                    Response to‚ÄïNebraska doctrine, and the Dred Scott decision
                    The three bad things argued in Dred Scott
                        Preventing slaves from being citizens
                        Neither congress or legislature is allowed to exclude slavery
                            Roger Tawney argues that states do not have the authority to regulate rights to property
                        Hunting slaves in northern states
                            Excluding slave owners from bringing in their slaves is &quot;unconstitutional&quot;
                            Lincoln fears this will habituate others to the presence of slaves, as demonstrated in his  Lincoln Speech Text - Kalamazoo Valley Museum 
                            Habituation‚ÄïExposing bad things to others will normalize them
                    Dred Scott decision has rendered Douglas' policy impossible to implement
                    The Problem with Popular Sovereignty‚Äïimpossible to implement
                    Three possible stances that Lincoln can take that are not radically abolitionist
                        No expansions of slavery
                        Squatter sovereignty‚Äïwhoever comes first can vote in a slave constitution
                    What Dredd Scott accomplishes is that‚Äïyou can't ban slavery ANYWHERE
                    The conspiracy paragraph
                        Summary: They acted as not &quot;pro-slavery&quot;, but worked in the background to ensure that this was the case
                         	 Why was the amendment, expressly declaring the right of the people to exclude  slavery, voted down? Plainly enough now, the adoption of it would have  spoiled the niche for the Dred Scott decision.
                         	 Why was the amendment, expressly declaring the right of the people to exclude  slavery, voted down? Plainly enough now, the adoption of it would have  spoiled the niche for the Dred Scott decision.
                         	 Why was the court decision held up? Why even a Senator's individual opinion  withheld, till after the presidential election? Plainly enough now,  the speaking out then would have damaged the &quot;perfectly free&quot;  argument upon which the election was to be carried.
                         	 Why the outgoing President's felicitation on the indorsement? Why the  delay of a reargument? Why the incoming President's advance exhortation  in favor of the decision?
                         	 These things look like the cautious patting and petting of  a spirited horse, preparatory to mounting him, when it is dreaded that he may  give the rider a fall.
                         	 And why the hasty after indorsements of the decision by the President  and others?
                         	 We can not absolutely know that all these exact adaptations are the  result of preconcert. But when we see a lot of framed timbers, different  portions of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places  and by different workmen -- Stephen, Franklin, Roger, and James, for instance --  and when we see these timbers joined together, and see they exactly make the  frame of a house or a mill, all the tenons and mortices exactly fitting,  and all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted  to their respective places, and not a piece too many or too few -- not omitting  even scaffolding -- or, if a single piece be lacking, we can see the place  in the frame exactly fitted and prepared to yet bring such piece in -- in such   a case, we find it impossible not to believe that Stephen and Franklin and  Roger and James all understood one another from the beginning, and all  worked upon a common plan or draft drawn up before the first  lick was struck.
                Rather than to reunify, he hopes to reclaim what is lost
                Lacompton Constitution
                    Force a fake constitution upon the people through a fraudulent vote
                    Douglas takes a stance against this (to set him in favor of both north and south), and wishes to see it legitimately and &quot;doesn't care if it is voted up or down&quot; due to his stance on popular sovereignty
                        
                        Lincoln traps this and takes it down
                    Another highly noticeable difference  between the views of Douglas and Lincoln was based on the fact that  black Americans also had legal rights. According to Douglas, he believed  that, in all aspects of life, the black people would always be inferior  to the white people and highly opposed the issue of citizenship for the  black people. According to Lincoln, he believed that the black people  were meant to be treated as equals to the white people including Douglas  himself. In retaliation to remarks that Lincoln had said, Douglas  replied saying ‚ÄúMr. Lincoln asserts, as a fundamental principle of this  government, that there must be uniformity in the local laws and domestic  institutions of each and all the States of the Union; and he therefore,  invites all the non-slaveholding States to band together, organize as  one body, and make war upon slavery in the states that still practiced  slavery‚Äù (Richard, 1965).¬†
            September 21st, 2020 LD Debates
                 First Debate: Ottawa, Illinois - Lincoln Home National Historic Site (U.S. National Park Service)
                    Introduction
                        Turns tables on the conspiracy  theory, Lincoln is a conspirator
                        Lincoln abolitionizes the Whig Party
                    The agreement between Lincoln, Whigs, Abolitionists, etc.
                    Lincoln argues that the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was the fire that started the fracture
                    &quot;I think, and shall try to show, that it is wrong; wrong in its  direct effect, letting slavery into Kansas and Nebraska-and wrong in its  prospective principle, allowing it to spread to every other part of the  wide world, where men can be found inclined to take it.
                        &quot;This declared indifference, but, as I must think, covert real  zeal for the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate. I hate it because of  the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it  deprives our republican example of its just influence in the  world-enables the enemies of free institutions, with plausibility, to  taunt us as hypocrites-causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our  sincerity, and especially because it forces so many really good men  amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles  of civil liberty-criticizing the Declaration of Independence, and insisting that there is no right principle of action but self-interest.
                        &quot;Before proceeding, let me say I think I have no prejudice against  the Southern people. They are just what we would be in their situation.  If slavery did not now exist among them, they would not introduce it. If  it did now exist amongst us, we should not instantly give it up. This I  believe of the masses North and South. Doubtless there are individuals  on both sides, who would not hold slaves under any circumstances; and  others who would gladly introduce slavery anew, if it were out of  existence. We know that some Southern men do free their slaves, go  North, and become tiptop Abolitionists; while some Northern ones go  South, and become most cruel slave-masters.
                &quot;Maintenance of integrity&quot;
                    Implies that we are losing integrity
                    We are intrinsically good
                    Loss aversion, the reverence of Lincoln to the birth of the nation
                    We were born to such a high standard and are having a retrogression
                Now, gentlemen, I don't want to read at any greater length, but this  is the true complexion of all I have ever said in regard to the  institution of slavery and the black race. This is the whole of it, and  anything that argues me into his idea of perfect social and political  equality with the negro, is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of  words, by which a man can prove a horse-chestnut to be a chestnut horse.  [Laughter.] I will say here, while upon this subject, that I have no  purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of  slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right  to do so, and I have no inclination to do so. I have no purpose to  introduce political and social equality between the white and the black  races. There is a physical difference between the two, which, in my  judgment, will probably forever forbid their living together upon the  footing of perfect equality, and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that  there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of  the race to which I belong having the superior position. I have never  said anything to the contrary, but I hold that, notwithstanding all  this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to  all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence,  the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. [Loud cheers.]  I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man. I agree  with Judge Douglas he is not my equal in many respects-certainly not in  color, perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment. But in the right  to eat the bread, without the leave of anybody else, which his own hand  earns, he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man. [Great applause.]
            Writing Tips
                Remove perhaps, arguably, any other qualifiers unless you really need them
                    If you want to argue, argue it. Don't say &quot;arguably&quot; as if someone else is arguing it
            September 30th, 2020   Song of Myself (1892 version) by Walt Whitman | Poetry Foundation
                In the sixth section of the poem, the poet transitions to a story about a child holding a handful of leaves and asking, ‚ÄúWhat is the grass?‚Äù Though the poet knows this is an impossible question, he continues to muse on it, thinking that the grass may be the leaves, the child, of God. He goes on to catalog all the things he sees in the world: the people, animals, and natural features. He declares that he loves them all just as they are and loves the way they fit together. The poet sees them all as part of God‚Äôs works, just as the grass is a simple thing that is still divine because God made it.
                Section 15‚ÄïThe poet observes or &quot;takes in&quot; his surroundings. One can observe the sounds of the singer, conductor beating time, the plane whistling, the drove singing. There is an example of a prostitute that lasts for three lines, which the author regards the booing crowd with disdain
                    The final three lines of this section work to pull the chaos of this vast catalog of sensory impressions into a kind of unity, and that unity is the self that has perceived them. Any single ‚ÄúI‚Äù has one vantage point, one set of eyes and ears that is continually absorbing the welter of sense impressions around the ‚ÄúI.‚Äù From that vantage point, it feels as if the world is ‚Äútending inward to me,‚Äù inclining, moving, stretching in toward the self‚Äôs eyes and ears and nose and tongue. At the same time, the ‚ÄúI‚Äù feels something in the self that is extending out toward the world, toward that endless stream of sights and sounds and smells. ‚ÄúI tend outward to them‚Äù: our senses reach out to the things of the world, always; our eyes are hungry to see, and our ears are hungry to hear. But so many things pass in front of our eyes and ears that we miss or ignore or are oblivious to, so we need also to ‚Äúattend‚Äù to them, to take care to register and record them (as Whitman has done in this section with such loving care). So it is always what Whitman calls an ‚Äúinflux‚Äù and an ‚Äúefflux,‚Äù the world incessantly whirling toward our senses, and our senses reaching out to absorb that world. And that, more or less, is what we are: we are the things we have seen, heard, touched, tasted, smelled: ‚Äúsuch as it is to be of these more or less I am.‚Äù No idea we have, no word we use, no love we feel, did not originate ‚Äúout there.‚Äù They all entered in through our open senses, our senses which extended out to embrace them and then tended to them as we absorbed them: and out of all those endless stimuli, we each weave the unique song of our self.
                Section 28‚Äï
                    This section contains the famous &quot;crisis&quot; in which Whitman seems to be under attack from himself. Some critics think this section is about masturbation.
                    At any rate, he feels that the power of &quot;touch&quot; has gotten way out of hand (no pun intended).
                    This passage is filled with sexually suggestive phrases like &quot;treacherous tip of me,&quot; &quot;stiffening my limbs,&quot; &quot;red marauder,&quot; and &quot;I went myself first to the headland . . . my own hands carried me there.&quot;
                    He feels suffocated by his sense of touch, which overpowers him and creates an enormous release of energy.
                    Let's face it: it's hard not to read the end of this section as a veiled reference to orgasm and ejaculation.
                Section 38
                    He's tired of moping around and being in the dumps. Too many thoughts about amputation and imprisonment threaten to rob him of his optimism.
                    He has been stunned, but now he snaps out of it and regains his bold, aggressive posture, telling us to &quot;stand back!&quot;
                    He has almost committed some &quot;usual mistake,&quot; which seems to have something to do with complaining and dwelling on his own problems.
                    He almost forgot about everyone else's problems, the people who are mocked and crucified beside him. He can't treat his own sufferings any differently.
                    He compares himself to Jesus Christ rising from his tomb after crucifixion.
                    And we're back in business. The old, confident Walt is back, and he continues his journey through the United States, this time on foot.
                    He salutes the students (&quot;eleves&quot;) of the world, but says he is both in front of and behind them. (The word,¬†√©l√®ve¬†is French for &quot;student.&quot;)
                Section 49 - He uses &quot;you&quot; to personify Life and Death
                    context‚Äïin the 1850s, you had the domestication of death where graveyards were made elaborate and beautiful. He uses the word &quot;manure&quot; to interesting effect
                Section 48-52
                    The speaker now sums up what he has been saying all along: the body and the soul are equals, and the self is most important of all, even more important than God.
                    He is no longer fearful of death
                    He describes death or the ending, eternal life, Happiness
                    He's only going to stay another minute, so he'd better speak honestly before he snuffs out his evening candle and goes to bed.
                        Do I contradict myself?
                        Very well then I contradict myself,
                        (I am large, I contain multitudes.)
                    A hawk flies above, and the speaker's voice is untranslatable and rambling in a romantic way

                Cooper Union Speech
                    The carefully crafted speech examined the views of the 39 signers of the Constitution. Lincoln noted that at least 21 of them -- a majority -- believed Congress should control slavery in the territories, rather than allow it to expand. Thus, the Republican stance of the time was not revolutionary, but similar to the Founding Fathers, and should not alarm Southerners, for radicals had threatened to secede if a Republican was elected President.  Abraham Lincoln's Cooper Union Address  
                    Founding fathers intent
                    They say we are sectional because we do not exist in their section. But, without change of principle, should we gain votes in your sectional, we shall cease to be sectional? (120)
                    Do you really feel yourselves justified to divide up this government? (130)
                    John brown: There is an inevitability of violence, but stick with us and it might be okay (more radical than house divided but also interestingly pacifist)
                    Lincoln could say &quot;should we&quot;, but &quot;can we&quot; implies a physicality to morality. We cannot do something, as if the predefinition of nature stops us from this. We cannot yield (129)

                    Discusses alternative constitution
                    Discusses that the South will be okay in the case of seccession
                    Our system commits no such violation of nature's laws. With us, all of the white race, however high or low, rich or poor, are equal in the eye of the law. Not so with the negro. Subordination is his place. He, by nature, or by the curse against Canaan, is fitted for that condition which he occupies in our system.
                    We have all the essential elements of a high national career. The idea has been given out at the North, and even in the border States, that we are too small and too weak to maintain a separate nationality. This is a great mistake. In extent of territory we embrace five hundred and sixty-four thousand square miles and upward. This is upward of two hundred thousand square miles more than was included within the limits of the original thirteen States. It is an area of country more than double the territory of France or the Austrian empire. France, in round numbers, has but two hundred and twelve thousand square miles. Austria, in round numbers, has two hundred and forty-eight thousand square miles. Ours is greater than both combined. It is greater than all France, Spain, Portugal, and Great Britain, including England, Ireland, and Scotland, together. In population we have upward of five millions, according to the census of 1860; this includes white and black. The entire population, including white and black, of the original thirteen States, was less than four millions in 1790, and still less in 76, when the independence of our fathers was achieved. If they, with a less population, dared maintain their independence against the greatest power on earth, shall we have any apprehension of maintaining ours now?
                    In this connection I take this occasion to state, that I was not without grave and serious apprehensions, that if the worst came to the worst, and cutting loose from the old government should be the only remedy for our safety and security, it would be attended with much more serious ills than it has been as yet. Thus far we have seen none of those incidents which usually attend revolutions. No such material as such convulsions usually throw up has been seen. Wisdom, prudence, and patriotism, have marked every step of our progress thus far. This augurs well for the future, and it is a matter of sincere gratification to me, that I am enabled to make the declaration. Of the men I met in the Congress at Montgomery, I may be pardoned for saying this, an abler, wiser, a more conservative, deliberate, determined, resolute, and patriotic body of men, I never met in my life. Their works speak for them; the provisional government speaks for them; the constitution of the permanent government will be a lasting monument of their worth, merit, and statesmanship.
                    Why cannot the whole question be settled, if the north desire peace, simply by the Congress, in both branches, with the concurrence of the President, giving their consent to the separation, and a recognition of our independence?

                    Most nations don't have language for secession
                        The Duke of Argyll, one of the few British statesmen of the time who followed this struggle with intelligent interest, briefly summed up the question thus: &quot;I know of no government in the world that could possibly have admitted the right of secession from its own allegiance.&quot; Oddly enough, President Buchanan, in his Message to Congress on December 4, put the same point not less forcibly.
                    Many whites did not own slaves but viewed the enslavement as a point of pride (154), despite the practice not helping them

                        There is no right to exit because there's no unanimity in agreement of it

                        In the guise of neutrality, it would tie the hands of union men (251)
                    &quot;This magical omnipotence of 'state rights', asserting a claim of power to lawfully destroy the Union itself? (256)
                    This is in contradiction to the &quot;more perfect union&quot; envisaged in the Preamble of the constitution
                    &quot;The States have their status IN the Union, and they have no other legal status. If they break from this, they can do so only against law, and by revolution. The Union, and not themselves separately, procutred their independence, and their liberty.&quot; (256)
                    Unquestionably the states have the powers, and rights, reserved to them in, and by the National Constitution; but among these, surely, are not included all conceivable powers, however mischievous, or destructive... (256)

                    Fills Supreme Court
                    &quot;Labor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration. Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always will be, a relation between labor and capital producing mutual benefits. The error is in assuming that the whole labor of community exists within that relation. A few men own capital, and that few avoid labor themselves, and with their capital hire or buy another few to labor for them. A large majority belong to neither class--neither work for others nor have others working for them. In most of the Southern States a majority of the whole people of all colors are neither slaves nor masters, while in the Northern a large majority are neither hirers nor hired. Men, with their families--wives, sons, and daughters--work for themselves on their farms, in their houses, and in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and asking no favors of capital on the one hand nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other.&quot;
                    &quot;Many independent men everywhere in these States a few years back in their lives were hired laborers. The prudent, penniless beginner in the world labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself, then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him. This is the just and generous and prosperous system which opens the way to all, gives hope to all, and consequent energy and progress and improvement of condition to all.&quot;

                    Physicality
                        There are those who are dissatisfied with me. To such I would say: You desire peace; and you blame me that we do not have it. But how can we attain it? There are but three conceivable ways. First, to suppress the rebellion by force of arms. This I am trying to do. Are you for it? If you are, so far we are agreed. If you are not for it, a second way is to give up the Union. I am against this. Are you for it? If you are, you should say so plainly. If you are not for force, nor yet for dissolution, there only remains some imaginable compromise. I do not believe any compromise, embracing the maintenance of the Union, is now possible. All I learn, leads to a directly opposite belief. The strength of the rebellion, is its military--its army. That army dominates all the country, and all the people, within its range. Any offer of terms made by any man or men within that range, in opposition to that army, is simply nothing for the present; because such man or men, have no power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise, if one were made with them. To illustrate. Suppose refugees from the South, and peace men of the North, get together in convention, and frame and proclaim a compromise embracing a restoration of the Union; in what way can that compromise be used to keep Lee's army out of Pennsylvania?

                    ‚ÄúWhen, early in the war, Gen. Fremont attempted military emancipation, I forbade it, because I did not then think it an indispensable necessity. When a little later, Gen. Cameron, then Secretary of War, suggested the arming of the blacks, I objected, because I did not yet think it an indispensable necessity. When, still later, Gen. Hunter attempted military emancipation, I again forbade it, because I did not yet think the indispensable necessity had come. When, in March, and May, and July 1862 I made earnest, and successive appeals to the border states to favor compensated emancipation, I believed the indispensable necessity for military emancipation, and arming the blacks would come, unless averted by that measure. They declined the proposition; and I was, in my best judgment, driven to the alternative of either surrendering the Union, and with it, the Constitution, or of laying strong hand upon the colored element. I chose the latter. In choosing it, I hoped for greater gain than loss; but of this, I was not entirely confident. More than a year of trial now shows no loss by it in our foreign relations, none in our home popular sentiment, none in our white military force,---no loss by it any how or any ]where. On the contrary, it shows a gain of quite a hundred and thirty thousand soldiers, seamen, and laborers. These are palpable facts, about which, as facts, there can be no cavilling. We have the men; and we could not have had them without the measure.‚Äù (585)

                        Discussion
                            My argument on friendship
                                position‚ÜíFriendship is mutually beneficial. That is to say, both partners of a friendship benefit from it.
                                position‚ÜíCommon knowledge is a requirement of friendships. That is to say, to be friends, both partners must recognize their relationship as friendship, and be aware that the other partner also considers their relationship as friendship, be aware that the other partner is aware of that consideration, ad infinitum.
                                counter position‚ÜíThere is only one counterexample required to refute this claim. We seek to provide an example of two friends where the fact that the two are friends is not common knowledge. That is to say, they may both consider each other friends, but are not aware that the other person considers them as friends, etc..
                                Let us adopt Aristotle's kinds of friendship as a definition for friendship. We seek a relationship satisfying the above conditions that is also capable of fulfilling, at the very least, Aristotle's first kind of friendship (friendship of pleasure).
                                Consider two friends where the fact they are friends is mutual knowledge, but not common knowledge. They both consider each other friends, spending time together out of self-interest and the pleasure they derive from each other. However, while the two are friends through Aristotle's definition of &quot;friendship of pleasure&quot;, they never disclose to each other, verbally or implicitly, that one considers the other a friend. The existence of this counterexample refutes the above position.
                            Exegesis vs. systematic philosophy‚ÜíSystematic looks for truth, exegesis looks at what people were thinking or meaning

                                    Anjali's response: common knowledge requirement?
                                    My response: shared activity is a requirement but not the only requirement
                            Alin: friendship should have common knowledge of each other as a person, not necessarily that each person regards the other as a friend

                            Cowan's study of 96 couples, four different pathways that couples take in deciding to become pregnant and carry the pregnancy to term. First are couples who agree about when to begin trying to become pregnant (about half of their sample). Then there are the couples who &quot;find themselves pregnant&quot; and decide to &quot;accept fate&quot; and go ahead (about 15%). Another set of couples (about 20% of the sample) are still ambivalent when they reach the 7th month of pregnancy. Finally, for some couples who are at serious loggerheads about the decision, one spouse agrees to become a parent only because the other threatens to go it alone (about 10%)
                            Average decline in marital satisfaction was almost completely accounted for by couples who (1) no planning; (2) ambivalent late in pregnancy, or (3) disagreed about having a baby but went ahead and conceived without resolving their difference

                                position‚ÜíParents often cite how proud they are of their children when their children achieve great things. Should this pride in their children also extend towards themselves, it is justified. Parents can and deserve to derive satisfaction from the pride in their child's success due to their personal role in their development.
                                strongest counterargument‚ÜíAs little as 5% of a child's personality is determined by parental influence. This is supported through studies: identical twins raised separately have similar personalities, and adopted siblings raised in the same household are often as different as two people from the population can be. Parents shouldn't be proud of themselves, as they do not have nearly as large a role in their child's development as they likely suppose.
                                response‚ÜíAbout 50% of personality is genetic from birth. Even if you don't add the 5% of the counterargument to this figure, this means that the parents are the majority stakeholder in their child's development ever since the child is conceived. Additionally, the counterargument makes the assumption that you must know the share of your contribution to be proud of your children. In the same way that citizens can be proud of their country constructing a beautiful landmark, one does not need to know what &quot;percent&quot; or share of something of their contribution to be proud of something. In fact, one does not even need to be the majority stakeholder to derive pride: simply seeing any positive effect from their effort or participation can be sufficient to experience pride.

                            Why is it wrong?
                                Because it is intrinsically wrong. This is philosophyspeak for ‚Äúit‚Äôs just wrong, wrong because of what it is, wrong by its very nature.‚Äù 2.   Because it produces bad effects, i.e. harms social trust, damages various kinds of relationships‚Äîpersonal, professional, political--- leads people to harm based on false information, etc. 3.   Because lying cannot be something that we all do. If we all did it, nobody would believe me when I lie and so it would be pointless to lie. But if we all cannot do it, why am I allowed to do it and not you and you and you... But then we are all doing it. 4.   Because it is an assertion of what you believe to be false and this violates a convention of language. 5.   Because of the intention behind the lie, i.e. to deceive another person. 6.   Because telling a lie is a violation of the autonomy of the hearer. It is an exercise of power over another rational individual‚Äîall the more insidious because it sometimes is undetected. 7.   Because telling a lie treats another person as a means to some end. This is true even of lies told to benefit the hearer. In such case he is treated as a means to his own good. 8.   Because telling lie is a violation of a duty to yourself to be truthful. 9.   Because a principle forbidding lying would be agreed to by all of us if we were trying to find a principle to regulate our common behavior that we could all agree to.

And if everyone is entitled to lie, and everybody knows this, then what you say will not be believed. And if you are not believed, your lie will not save your friend. So universalising your act of lying makes what you are trying to accomplish impossible, i.e. self-defeating. So we should never lie.
                                            We are not allowed to lie to save a life

                                        There are many things I know which I will never apply
                                        There are some things I will succeed in, or apply, but never know
                                        Platonic Problem: What happens if you succeed by accident? Imagine you are really good at something, applying, but do not know? Is there value when there is no knowledge?

                                Americans privately give more per capita to international causes more than almost any other nation
                        Discussion Section
                            Written Position
                                Position: Lying should be immoral under all circumstances, not just on a moral but practical standpoint. From a consequentialist view, this would, on average, enables a lie to gain utility most effectively. If one truly felt the need to lie, say to save a life, this would ensure that the lie is most likely to work.
                                It is possible for something to be both immoral yet practical in some cases. This is what this position argues is the case with lying. There is a point in which an individual may decide it is worth it to lie, to save a life, etc.. In the case that one does, one would wish that this lie is most effective. This would most effectively secure the desired outcome.
                                The reason why lying often works in the first place is due to the expectation that one does not lie. A lie's effectiveness is correlated to the degree the recipient does not expect to receive a lie. This expectation is strongest under the categorical imperative condition‚Äîthat it is immoral to lie, and one should not ever lie. The breaking of this condition and therefore expectation enables lies to be more effective.
                                To say that lying is ever morally permissable to lie sets a dangerous precedent. At what what benefit, or cost, or point is it suddenly permissable to lie? To save a life? To save someone from harm? Generalizing this, drawing the line of whether to lie or not may be obscure and self-serving‚Äîanyone can declare that their lie was justified. In this case, the effectiveness of lying would be reduced. If lying should be morally impermissable, it would be of a greater effectiveness than previously mentioned.
                                    To clarify, we declare that lying is never morally permissable, but may be, under certain conditions, practical. This is subjective and depends on the person.
                                CA: There are situations in which lying would be used to secure negative utility‚Äîfraud, theft, and many modern crimes are accompanied with lying. If this view is truly rooted in practicality or consequentalism, then it is not safe to assume that lying will be used only in cases to &quot;save a life&quot;. Most likely, there will be immoral people who will take advantage of the immorality of lying to cheat others.
                                Response: It is true that a lie under the CI condition could be used to secure negative utility more effectively. The real value of this position is not utility, but moral agency‚Äîthat is, one's ability to affect change through their moral character.
                                Possible CA to above response: The above response makes an invalid link between moral agency and physical agency. The fact that one's choice doesn't affect one's surroundings as effectively because lying is not immoral does not diminish the moral agency one experiences. In the above condition, one experiences the same degree of moral agency, whether the lie is effective or not.
                                A different possible response to above CA: We can also say that it is an imperative to act positive utility, but that's a different story.
                                I ran out of time to polish as I have another Midterm (this time in Computer Science) tomorrow haha
                            Lying should be done on the other person‚Äôs desires rather than the lier‚Äôs interpretation.  
                            The dying husband scenario: what if the wife wanted her husband to die a painful death?
                            Lying to serve someone‚Äôs self-image. It‚Äôs obvious that this is a subjective of whether it is moral or not moral to lie.
                            Just because the outcome is positive does not mean its‚Äô justified. Say I want to assassinate someone, miss and end up killing someone who was going to commit genocide. Just because the action‚Äôs outcome was positive does not mean that it is justified.
                            Lying is immoral because it creates an aberrance in the knowledge of the world. We have a moral obligation to advance the search of truth of humankind in this world. This absence of truth has the potential to lead others astray. It is this tinkering with the general knowledge of¬† the world that is immoral. That has the potential for bad outcomes.

                            Assertions that life is absurd are false
                                &quot;Nothing we do now will matter in a million years&quot;
                                    But by the same token, this means nothing in a million a matters. Then this statement doesn't mean anything
                                &quot;We are all going to die&quot;, so all chains of justifications don't matter. If the end result is death it doesn't matter

                                Life is always changing, and we would want the change to be good or bad
                                Prompt: When given the choice between a storied life and non storied life of equal utility (literally the same events but ordered), one should choose the former. There is inherently better goodness.

                                But we want change that is bad. What makes a good story?
                                    We do not want only good change. We want change that is for the better  
                                    The justification is what matters. It is not a life where there is no suffering, but a life where the suffering is justified  
                                    Not the content, but the context, that gives it value. The context that negative content is worth it in the end

                                There is something inherently alluring in improvement to the human psyche

                            There is something inherently good in improvement
                            Humans are always in up or down. There is no such thing as a flat line
                            We get bored of pleasure

                        You cannot know something until you experience it
                    Me:  The experiences of a soldier and peacemaker are different, and so they have different meanings of life. However, I contend that if we all experienced all the possible experiences of life, we would all arrive to the same conclusion. The meaning of life converges
                    Anjali: What about dying? What if we found out that through dying that death is way better than living
                    Me: This is interesting point. To imagine that the only way to converge to the meaning of life is to leave the realm of life and enter death
                    Armando: Dying vs. ceasing to exist are not the same thing
                        Dying could send you to the library
                        Ceasing to exist is conceptual

        Accrual Accounting
            GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)‚ÜîGuidelines accountants use to prepare financial reports
                revenue is ‚Äúearned‚Äù by a company when it provides‚Üía good or service
                revenue and expense does not need to be incurred at the same time as cash is being received
                for example, say Toyota buys $10MM in car parts from suppliers in 2020, but doesn‚Äôt sell the cars those parts were used to make until 2022. The $10MM expense will be counted on the Income Statement in the year‚Üí2022
                Apple pays one of its software engineers a $300,000 salary in a lump-sum payment at the end of each year. Six months into the year, Apple has incurred $150,000 in expenses even though they have paid $0 in cash.
                An industrial bakery buys $2MM in flour which it will use to make bread and pays immediately in cash. At the time of payment, $0 in expenses have been incurred. Over the next year, the company sells $5MM worth of bread, in which it used $1MM of the aforementioned flour. Throughout that year, the company has incurred $1MM of expenses associated with its flour $2MM purchase.
        Three major financial statements that are fundamental to financial analysis
            Income Statement:: Understanding revenues and expenses using Accrual Accounting #<a class="internal-link broken">Accrual Accounting</a> 
                all listed items are‚Üîtaxable
                general structure
                    
                    
                    
                    Revenue
                    COGS
                    Gross Profit‚ÜîRevenue - COGS
                    Gross Profit Margin‚ÜîPercent of revenue left after cost.Gross Profit / Revenue
                    Operating Expenses‚ÜîAnything not directly related to price of goods made
                        SG&amp;A‚ÜîSelling, General &amp; Administrative Expense
                        R&amp;D
                        D&amp;A
                    Operating Income‚ÜîTotal earnings before tax and interest. Gross Profit - Operating Expenses
                    Non-operating costs‚ÜîNot reflective of operating costs. Lawsuits, sudden fires, emergencies, etc.
                    Pre-Tax Income‚ÜîAll revenues and expenses except tax. Operating Income - Interest Expense + Other Income
                    Tax Expense‚ÜîApplied % tax to all previous items, because all listed items are taxable
                    Net Income‚ÜîTotal earnings left for investors after all previous summed. The sum of all revenues and expenses
                    Interest Payments
                    
                The income statement shows the revenues a company earns and the expenses they incur over a given period of time. Revenues and expenses are accounted for using the accrual accounting method. The sum of all these revenues and expenses lead to a figure called net income, which is a measure of profitability.
            Cash Flow Statement
                purpose is to reconcile‚Üíthe difference Net Income and the actual flow of cash
                corrects for‚Üídepreciation/invisible costs and untaxed income
                Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)
                    Net Income
                    ADD D&amp;A
                    SUBTRACT Accounts Receivable because it hasn't come yet
                    SUBTRACT Inventory because increasing inventory means cash has flowed out
                    ADD Accounts Payable because we still have the money/haven't paid it out yet
                    Pattern Cis to  add  changes in liabilities and  subtract   changes in assets.
                Cash Flow from Investing (in capital and other companies) (CFI)
                    Capital Expenditures (CapEx)‚ÜîPP&amp;E
                    Purchase/Sales of Securities‚ÜîSelling/Buying stocks of other companies
                    M&amp;A Activity
                Cash Flow from Financing (CFF)
                    Equity Issuing/Buybacks
                    Debt Issuing/Repayment
                    Dividend
                As we learned above, a revenue or expense on the income statement (under accrual accounting) does not necessarily align with an inflow or outflow of cash. Therefore, the net income figure at the bottom of the income statement almost never reflects net inflow or outflow of cash. The cash flow statement is used to reconcile this net income figure to a ‚Äúchange in cash‚Äù figure that reflects actual cashflow. In other words, it starts with net income and makes the appropriate adjustments so that we know how much cash entered/left the company in aggregate. Like the income statement, this is showing change over a given period of time.
            Balance Sheet
                used as‚Üísnapshot of current assets, debt, equity
                Assets, Debt, Equity Equation‚ÜîAssets = Debt (aka Liabilities) + Equity
                Assets

                    Retained Earnings‚ÜîSum of all periods' (net income - dividends)
                The balance sheet shows a snapshot of company‚Äôs asset, liability, and equity items at a specific point in time (unlike the IS and CFS, which show change over a given period of time). 
                    The key accounting equation that defines the balance sheet is Assets = Liabilities + Equity

            DCF
                Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) assumes that a company is worth the  sum  of all its future cash flows, discounted to the present to account for the time value of money.
                DCF is an  intrinsic  valuation method, meaning it doesn't rely on the valuation of other companies.
                Two parts: Explicit + Terminal Periods
                    
                Steps for Explicit
                    Step 1: Project our FCFF
                        EBIT‚ÜîOperating Income
                        Find EBIT
                        Project Cash Flows
                        Project Change in Net Working Capital (Current Assets - Current Liabilities)
                        FCF = EBIT * (1-Tax Rate)
                    Step 2: Discounting Cash Flows
                        The discount rate used in DCF is the  WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Cpital)
                        WACC‚ÜîCost of Equity * (E/(E+D)) + Cost of Debt * (D/(E+D)) * (1-Tax)
                        2a. Cost of equity
                            Cost of Equity is found using the  Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
                            Cost of Equity = R_rf + Beta * (R_m-R_rf)

                                 R_{rf}‚Üí Risk-free rate of return
                                Beta of the equity‚ÜîCorrelation to the market
                                    What's the beta of a slot machine?‚Üí0. Because a slot machine is not dependent on the market.
                                Rate of the return of the market
                                ‚ÄúWhat does beta represent, in plain English?‚Äù‚ÜîThe risk of the company relative to the risk of the stock market as a whole.
                Steps for Terminal

                    Perpetuity Growth Method‚Üîassumes cash flows will continue until infinity, and will grow a low stable rate
                        FCF‚ÜîFirst Year Cash Flow

                R is dedekind complete‚ÜíIf S  is nonempty set of  R  and  S  has an upper bound, it has a least upper bound (sup). If S  has lower bound, it has a greatest upper bound (inf). #Theorem
                    If  S\subseteq R  then S has at most one sup and one inf #Proposition
                        prove this by‚Üîcontradiction. Suppose  x  and  y  are both sups of S. Then both x and y are least upper bounds. So  x\leq y because  x  is a least upper bound and  y  is an upper bound. Likewise  y\leq x because  y  is a least upper bou nd and  x  is an upper bound. Therefore  x=y  .  
                    use the above in the following proof:::
                        Suppose  S\subseteq R  ,  S\neq 0 and  S has an upper bound. We prove a least upper bound  L exists by creating one digit at a time. We use the inspiration from \sqrt 2 . You keep on increasing the next digit until it's just under an upper bound, giving us  L .
                        We now prove that  L is the least upper bound, or that for all  x\in S that  x\leq L . Use contradiction to find  x&gt;L . Now compare  x  and  L 's first few digits until they differ

                        This digit of  x  must be bigger than  L . However, from the manner in which we formed  L , this is impossible, because every digit of  L  is as big as possible without being too big. Therefore,  x\leq L .

                example‚ÜíProve that  f: R\to R  via  f(x)=x^2  is continuous

            Proposition 29.1: If  A and B are matrices for which AB makes sense, then T_{AB}(\vec x) = T_A \circ T_B(\vec x)  , or AB(\vec x) = A (B \vec x)
                This explains why matrix multiplication is defined as it is
                Also explains why it's not commutative, because T_A(T_B(\vec x)) \neq T_B(T_A(\vec x)) . When applying linear maps (which are a type of function), the order matters. Since linear maps analogize to matrices, it works out.

        Day 32: Directional derivatives and gradients
            Partial derivative interpretation‚ÜîIf we change \vec p in a particular direction  \vec p + \vec e_it, how does f(\vec p + \vec e_it) change from f(\vec p)?

        Day 33: C^1 implies differentiability
             C^k ‚ÜíSay  U\subseteq R^n  is open and  f:u\to R^m.  Then we say  f  is  C^0  iff f is continuous. And for all k\geq 1, we say f is C^k iff every partial exists and those partials are all C^{k-1}.
                Aka C^k means you can take  k  partial derivatives in a row and all results are continuous
                 f  is  C^1\iff Jac_f  exists and is continuous as a function of  p 
            Theorem 33.1‚ÜîIf u\subseteq R^n  is open and f:u\to R^m  is C^1  then f is differentiable

        Day 35, 36:
            Smooth manifold‚ÜîA smooth manifold is a set M\subseteq R^n such that
                M  is (locally) the graph of a C^1 function f:u\to R^n where u\subseteq R^n is open
                This is called an  n-dimensional  manifold 
                    Locally,  n  variables determine the rest
                Locally means you can zoom in at a point  \vec p 
                    \exists V\subseteq R^m open such that \vec p \in V,  M\cap V  is the graph of a  C^1  function 
                    At this point  \vec p   , the area is smooth and is n-dimensional
            Tangent space‚ÜîLet M\subseteq R^n be a smooth manifold and pick \vec p \in M. The tangent space of M at  \vec p   is T_M(\vec p)=\{\vec v \in R^n:  there exists a  C^1  map  \gamma :(-1,1)\to M  such that  \gamma(0)=\vec p  and  \gamma^1(0)=\vec v\}  
                 \gamma:(-1,1)\to M  is a &quot;curve&quot; on  M .  \gamma(t)  traces a smooth path  C^1   along  M   
                All points where  \gamma  passes through  \vec p ? Now take the instantaneous velocity vector  \vec v  to get your set

            Animal Welfare | Factory FarmingJuly 1st, 2020
                 Why It's Time to End Factory Farming - Quillette
                    Think about the horses who were replaced by cars. Cars do the same thing horses do‚Äîthey move people from one place to another‚Äîbut without all the crap.
                    Farming is inefficent, at a ratio of ~1/10 
                    Factory farming: 99% in US, 90% globally
                Equality for Animals?
                    Comparison to how slavery was treated as normal
                    We are used to regarding the oppression of blacks and women as among the most important moral and political issues facing the world today. These are serious matters, worthy of the time and energy of any concerned person. But animals? Surely the welfare of animals is in a different category altogether, a matter for old ladies in tennis shoes to worry about. How can anyone waste their time on equality for animals when so many humans are denied real equality?
                    This attitude reflects a popular prejudice against taking the interests of animals seriously - a prejudice no better founded than the prejudice of white slaveowners against taking the interests of blacks seriously. It is easy for us to criticize the prejudices of our grandfathers, from which our fathers freed themselves. It is more difficult to distance ourselves from our own beliefs, so that we can dispassionately search for prejudices among them. What is needed now is a willingness to follow the arguments where they lead, without a prior assumption that the issue is not worth attending to.
                    Would experimenters be prepared to perform their experiments on orphaned humans with severe and irreversible brain damage if that were the only way to save thousands? ( I say 'orphaned' in order to avoid the complication of the feelings of the human parents.) If experimenters are not prepared to use orphaned humans with severe and irreversible brain damage, their readiness to use nonhuman animals seems to discriminate on the basis of species alone, since apes, monkeys, dogs, cats and even mice and rats are more intelligent, more aware of what is happening to them, more sensitive to pain, and so on, than many brain-damaged humans barely surviving in hospital wards and other institutions. There seems to be no morally relevant characteristic
                    Capacity for suffering
                        If I give a horse a hard slap across its rump with my open hand, the horse may start, but it presumably feels little pain. Its skin is thick enough to protect it against a mere slap. If I slap a baby in the same way, however, the baby will cry and presumably does feel pain, for its skin is more sensitive. So it is worse to slap a baby than a horse, if both slaps are administered with equal force. But there must be some kind of blow - I don't know exactly what it would be, but perhaps a blow with a heavy stick - that would cause the horse as much pain as we cause a baby by slapping it with our hand. That is what I mean by 'the same amount of pain' and if we consider it wrong to inflict that much pain on a baby for no good reason then we must, unless we are speciesists, consider it equally wrong to inflict the same amount of pain on a horse for no good reason.

                        objections to the Ben Franklin Objection
                            Most animals that kill for food would not be able to survive if they did not, whereas we have no need to eat animal flesh.
                            It is odd that humans should, when it suits them, use an argument that implies we ought to look to animals for moral guidance.
                            Nonhuman animals are not capable of considering the alternatives open to them or of reflecting on the ethics of their diet.
                    The Use of Mental Defectives
                        also known as‚Äï&quot;the argument from marginal cases&quot;
                        Counterarguments
                            Mental defectives who don't possess the capacities of normal humans should nevertheless be treated as if they did possess these capacities, since they belong to a species which typically possesses them
                            Although mental defectives may not possess higher capacities than other animals, they are nonetheless human beings
                            Slippery slope' argument
                Discussion
                    Pain is suffering, suffering is optional.
                    Decreasing demand is good but may not necessarily have the desired effect on supply
                        Halving demands doesn't necessarily result in twice as much space per animal, but the same amount and half the size of factories
                        The optimal strategy is not to only decrease the demand of factory farmed meat (which may have an unintended consequence on supply) but to increase the demand of ethically treated meat (which guarantees an intended consequence on supply)
                    Chicken sexers
                    Domestic sheep don't stop growing wool. Suppose we banned everything; would they all die off?
                    The ideal outcome is coexistence that is mutually beneficial to both of us, like dogs
                    Is it an evolutionary win to be factory farmed?
                        There are more chickens now than have ever been before
                        If we could help create them, feed them, and give them painless deaths, it could be great
                        If there is a way to reduce suffering in transit from beginning to end, that sounds like an optimal strategy

                Dragon in my garage‚ÄïInvisible dragon, but there is no way to disprove.
                    &quot;Where's the dragon?&quot; you ask.
                    &quot;Oh, she's right here,&quot; I reply, waving vaguely.¬† &quot;I neglected to mention that she's an invisible dragon.&quot;
                    You propose spreading flour on the floor of the garage to capture the dragon's footprints.
                    &quot;Good idea,&quot; I say, &quot;but this dragon floats in the air.&quot;
                    Then you'll use an infrared sensor to detect the invisible fire.
                    &quot;Good idea, but the invisible fire is also heatless.&quot;
                    You'll spray-paint the dragon and make her visible.
                    &quot;Good idea, but she's an incorporeal dragon and the paint won't stick.&quot;¬† And so on.¬† I counter every physical test you propose with a special explanation of why it won't work.
                    Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all?¬† If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists?¬† Your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true.

                The scarcity mindset - Maslow's hierarchy of needs, freeing up
                    Psychologists have shown that we tend to feel more capable of extending moral concern to others if we‚Äôre not competing with them for scarce resources and if our own needs are already taken care of. Abraham Maslow famously illustrated this basic concept with his image of a pyramid representing our hierarchy of needs.
                    The washing machine, the refrigerator, the electric stove ‚Äî were a major engine of liberation for women. Once the washing machine was invented and made widely accessible, for instance, women were freed up to do other things, like join the workforce.
                    The ethical crux‚Äïdo people have a moral obligation to engage with politics, etc.?
                        I am sympathetic to a consequentialist view
                Discounting‚Äï
                    distinction‚Äïit is different to discount because you value future lives less, given certain outcome (where you are certain that an action would give a parallel outcome in present and future) compared to because you are less certain of outcome, and value lives the same (EV)
                        Expected Future Utilty = Value of future lives saved * Certainty of outcome  
                Do you try to maximize happiness or minimize suffering?

                        There is no number of ordinary eight-year-olds who, when organized into a team, will become smart enough to beat a grandmaster in chess.
                        Is there a way that the suffering of millions of small sufferings equate to one large suffering?
                        You can't sum suffering of shallow depth to a different depth, in the same way you can't sum intelligence
                        There is a fundamental depth cannot be obtained

                Are we living in an influential time?
                Three scenarios
                    Peace.
                    A nuclear war that kills 99 per cent of the world‚Äôs existing population.
                    A nuclear war that kills 100 per cent.
                    The difference between 2 and 3 is much much bigger than‚Äï1 and 2 (even though most people would believe the opposite)
                Are we living in the most influential time in human history?
                    In the past, you represented a smaller proportion of the population and would be able to enact a greater percentage of change. However, technology improves the scope of influence
                    Population and technology are both exponential growth curves
                        rate of growth comparison‚Äïtech is more
                        start comparison‚Äïpopulation starts earlier
                        eclipsing‚Äïthere will be a point in which technology eclipses population and your ability to influence tomorrow will be greater than it is today, not less
                Lock in events‚Äïlocking in ethical values and unable to change, meaning that before the lock-in event is much more influential
                Is there any action that we can do in the future that adds value to the past?
                    inspiration‚Äïthe primary reason we pick the past is the idea that the past influences the future, but what if we pick future actions because they add value to the past?

            Are humans part of nature or not?
                Nature -&gt; Us -&gt; Technology, but now Technology -&gt; Us -&gt; Nature
                We are facing an unprecedented problem as we grow so rapidly, our understanding of nature no longer leads us to fear as much
                Nature controlled us, and we controlled technology. But now, technology controls us, and we control nature.
            What is wilderness? Is it a construct?
                There is an inherent bias in wilderness because it is a construct. We have evolved so quickly that there is no way to have a constant definition of wilderness.
                    An animal regards what humans create as nature? To them, nature has erected natural new structures around them.
                    A beaver regards a human dam as nature in the same way that a human regards a beaver dam.
                    As humans, we have an inherent bias of seeing everything through a human lens.
                Animals do not regard humans as separate, but as other animals. Or as God. Is introducing invasive species morally bad? Animals may view it objectively, while we view it subjectively. Because we have control over our actions and understand it.

                    The culture will not endure, but the system will
                        What if the system that we created, designed to combat a racist culture, is now antiracist to the point of being racist
                    Who would you wish to die?
                        Most people will already be irrelevant when they're old, so people who stay relevant are not the rule, but the exception
                        Therefore, I wish people to live longer
                    Who should live longer?
                        People should live longer
                            Vietnam, World War II, Holocaust survivors
                            Anyone who grew up with conventional warefare
                Pushy girls?
                Give everyone a stable income  The issue isn't inequality (or inequity I guess), but a lack of cash
                    Give Trump supporters a stable income, they wouldn't support Trump
                    Give young college students a stable income, heck they might be conservative
                When you're strapped for cash and the only problem is to get enough money, it's easy to scapegoat the millionaires and billionaires
                When you have cash, even able to purchase the products that these billionaires made possible, I would dare say that your life would be very different
                Success gives you a different kind of perspective
                Live life as a sprint, not a marathon
                    Approach the day as a series of sprints, and zoom out and marathon. Marathon of sprints. 2 hours of continuous work is worse than 30 minutes in 4 splits
                The best advice: avoid zero days at all costs. Live nonzero
                    Anything more than zero is improvement. Zero is atrophy. If I get nothing done in a day, it sucks. But if I do one push-up, I get stronger. If I do one math problem, I get smarter. Avoid nonzeroes at all costs

                The glories of the cloud
                Automation of service vs. manufacturing: automating requires no infrastructure, service is more likely
                Companies lose millions on passwords
                Cloud compute is effective because sending compute power is fast and easy, so scaling is easy. Imagine ice cream parlor that scales perfectly without inventory because there's an ice cream cloud that can send it perfectly

        Call with Yalies, Longtermism-Not applications, but philosophic implications
            Race to Mars--Good thing?
                I think we're thinking of this as inherently zero sum when it doesn't have to be
                Growing the pie, not the slice
                Perhaps the allocation is not optimal, but an increase in innovation in general is a net positive for society
            The romanticize of something as life or death (survival of the species) encourages sacrifice
            Not what longtermism is or what counts as it, but if it is true
                 Introducing longtermism
                    A typical social discount rate might be 1% per year, which means that  benefits in 100 years are only worth 36% as much as benefits today, and  benefits in 1000 years are worth almost nothing.
            Discounting
                Discounting as a concept works, but not quantitatively and measurably
                The fundamental trade of immediate certain gain vs. long-term potential immense gains (over compounded)
                Norwegian Sovereign Wealth fund - Set as a mandate to place more emphasis on future generations
            How many animal lives is a human life worth? My most standards, people are uncomfortable with this comparison, but is it somehow more palatable to do this with potential humans because they do not exist?
            Is it inherently good to bring people into existence
                The repugnant conclusion/scenario (Counter of Utilitarianism)‚ÄïWe should bring as many people as possible into existence until the net increase is zero. Quality of life doesn't matter.
                Are we trying to maximize happiness or minimize suffering?
                    The utilitarian argument is yes, the other one is no
                    Most religions have at a central tenet that life is suffering
                    If climate change is inevitable, should we bring more people in if they might not live? -More chance that some people live. If 10% survive, then more likely to keep human existence in place
                        Would you kill Baby Hitler? One person can cause immense suffering, but can also cause immense happiness
                Anti-natalism‚ÄïUnborn babies / Is it wrong to bring someone into existence if their life is complete suffering
                    The paradox of utilitarianism is why should we have the authority to prevent suffering when suffering is in fact subjective, and we are incapable of measuring the potential suffering an organism will endure. Whereas the measurement of happiness does not need to be exact in order for it to be worth it

            The Boulder City Council is planning a public meeting to discuss how to manage and develop a new parcel of open space land that the City of Boulder recently acquired. This is an important public issue and many people have strong opinions about what to do--or not do--with the land. The City Council wants citizen input, but there are so many people interested in this issue that it will be impossible to involve everyone at a public meeting. So the City Council creates a &quot;citizen's input panel&quot; made up of ten Boulder residents who will gather input from the entire community and represent these interests to the City Council in a report to be presented at the upcoming public meeting.

                Dummy variables‚Äïa variable that takes two values, generally one or zero
                    a much better way of using categorical variables in regression
                    add one dummy variable for one less than the number of unique values in the categorical variable  
                    if the variable is binary, you'd add one dummy
                    if there are four categories, you'd add three dummy variables.

            Jupiter's rampage into the asteroid belt theory
                Explains why
                    Mars is smaller than normal (Jupiter threw away a lot of material)
                    No planets near the asteroid belt (the materials there are moving way too quickly to form a planet)

                Volume calculated in ancient times, mass extrapolated from gravity
                density = 5.5 tons/cubic meter, but crust is much less dense than this
                Deep earth must be very dense

    Breathe through nose, not mouth
        Breathing out of mouth releases 40% more than nose
        Nose takes in 20% more oxygen than equivalent through mouth
        Tape up mouth, through nose
        Exhales should be completely in and out
            The body needs a balance of CO2 and O2, not enough CO2 is a bad thing

examples
Fitness and Strength Training: The ‚Äúbeginner gains‚Äù come quickly at first, but then it becomes more difficult to get stronger each week.
Literacy: Children and young students make massive leaps as they learn how to read. Meanwhile, college students and well-educated adults have to put in a focused effort to expand their vocabulary beyond commonly used words.
Language proficiency: Learning how to speak even a rudimentary level of a new language opens up a whole new world. However, there are only meager gains left for fluent speakers to discover.
Weight Loss: It may be relatively easy to shed five pounds within a week or two, but then the progress slows. Each successive pound of fat loss is more stubborn than the last.
Musical skill: Improvements come quickly for a novice guitar player. Improvements come very slowly for a concert pianist.

                    Investments and wealth: Thanks to the power of compound interest, your retirement savings start out as a small treasure in the early years, but balloon in size during the final decade or two of savings.
                    Email subscribers and website traffic: New websites receive just a trickle of traffic here and there, but as the weeks and months roll on those trickles can build into a raging river of visitors and subscribers.
                    Entrepreneurship and business growth: The assets that you build for your business stack on top of one another and revenue compounds throughout the life of a successful business.
                    Social media followers: When you only have 100 followers, getting another 100 followers may take six months. Once you have 1,000 followers, however, getting the next 100 may only take one month. Once you have 100,000 followers, getting another 100 probably takes one day. Your growth rate snowballs.

    Writing
        Write It Like an Email
            There was an experiment a couple of decades back that teachers conducted. They gave their students two assignments:
            a) Write a composition on paper
            b) Write on the same topic in an email
            They  were surprised to find that almost everyone scored higher in writing  the email. There was something about this medium of typed text that  released the burden off of the kids‚Äô chests and allowed them to be  natural. They didn‚Äôt use too many fancy words, and they just said what  they wanted to say in an organic, direct way.
            I‚Äôve  found that a great way to start writing a new blog post is to tell  yourself that you‚Äôre writing an email to an old friend after one or two  glasses of wine.
    What has been done before, can be done again (The story of the four minute mile)
        Why do you think we remember the first, but not the second? Following pushed boundaries is natural of human condition. Likewise, it is important to leverage this to our advantage. Read about other people's stories.

            &quot;What you do in the dark is what makes you shine in the light&quot;
            &quot;You throw a bucket of water on a rock and it doesn't do anything. You let a drop of water fall onto a rock everyday, it creates a hole in that rock.&quot;
            ‚ÄúYou are only entitled to the action, never to its fruits.‚Äù - Bhagavad Gita, the ancient Sanskrit scripture

        Risk Taking #<a class="internal-link broken">Risk Taking</a> 
            The biggest risk is not taking any. The biggest failure is never failing. Ask the impossible questions. I am certain that there's a good chance that after this talk, many of you won't try. Statistics is not on your side. But that means that even wanting to be better makes you different, a minority that separates you from everyone else.
            Be the best at what you do, or the only one doing it
            The biggest risk is not taking one
        Misc.  
            Nothing is boring. If you're bored you're boring
        
    Interpersonal (Making Friends)
        Making Friends / Caring
            To the world you may be one person; but to one person you may be the world
            &quot;Nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you care&quot; Theodore Roosevelt
            If you want to make friends, make people feel better when you're with them than when you are not
            ‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt anyone you couldn‚Äôt love once you‚Äôve heard their story. ‚Äù‚Äï Mary Lou Kownacki
            ‚ÄúHumility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less.‚Äù‚Äï CS Lewis
            
        Conversation
            &quot;Speak only when you fully intend on finishing your sentence&quot; - Charisma in Command
            &quot;A good listener is one who helps us overhear ourselves.&quot; - Yahia Lababid
            Comforting
                ‚ÄúYou do not get to make me extraordinary as an excuse not to succeed.‚Äù ‚Äî Lisa Nichols.
    James Clear
        Praise others. It will bring them peace of mind.  Do not expect others to praise you. It will bring you peace of mind.
        Most failures are one-time costs. Most regrets are recurring costs. The pain of inaction stings longer than the pain of incorrect action.
        &quot;Your success depends on the risks you take.  Your survival depends on the risks you avoid.&quot;
        Opportunity: &quot;If you spend too much time working on good things, then you don‚Äôt have much time left to work on great things.&quot; - James Clear
        &quot;Procrastinating on something important is choosing to delay a better future.&quot;
        ‚ÄúMost people don‚Äôt have trouble with focusing. They have trouble with deciding.‚Äù-James Clear
        Asking Good Questions
            The physicist¬†Isidor Isaac Rabi¬†on the importance of good questions (and good mothers):
            ‚ÄúMy mother made me a scientist without ever intending to.
            Every other Jewish mother in Brooklyn would ask her child after school: 'So? Did you learn anything today?'
            But not my mother.
            'Izzy,' she would say, 'did you ask a good question today?'
            That difference ‚Äî asking good questions ‚Äî made me become a scientist.‚Äù
        Results vs. Lifestyle
            &quot;In the long-run, the people who succeed are the ones who want to live the lifestyle that precedes the results.
            Stop asking, &quot;What results do I want to have?&quot;
            Start asking, &quot;What lifestyle do I want to live?&quot;
            It's common to want results. It's rare to want the lifestyle.&quot;
        ‚ÄúWinning is great, sure, but if you are really going to do something in life, the secret is learning how to lose. Nobody goes undefeated all the time. If you can pick up after a crushing defeat, and go on to win again, you are going to be a champion someday.&quot; --Wilma Rudolph
        Taking Shots
            &quot;A few things you need to achieve exceptional results:
            1) Quantity: You take lots of shots.
            2) Quality: You take thoughtful shots.
            3) Consistency: You keep shooting for a long time.
            4) Feedback. You take better shots over time.
            5) Luck: You get a few favorable bounces.&quot;
        Avoid Debt
            &quot;Don‚Äôt spend what you haven‚Äôt earned.
            Avoid financial debt. Don‚Äôt spend money you haven‚Äôt earned.
            Avoid social debt. Don‚Äôt spend goodwill you haven‚Äôt earned.
            Avoid calendar debt. Don‚Äôt spend (free) time you haven‚Äôt earned.
            The disciplined earner can be a guilt-free spender.&quot;
        &quot;Most people think they lack motivation when they really lack clarity.&quot;
        &quot;What looks like talent is often careful preparation. What looks like skill is often persistent revision.&quot;
        &quot;Rowing harder doesn't help if the boat is headed in the wrong direction.&quot; -Kenichi Ohmae
        &quot;Feel compliments as deeply as you feel insults.&quot;
        Reading vs. Reflection
            &quot;Reading can teach you the best of what others already know.
            Reflection can teach you the best of what only you can know.&quot;
        &quot;Be radically proactive about any behavior that pays off in 10 years.&quot;
        Ignorance vs. Genius
            &quot;To simplify before you understand the details is ignorance.
            To simplify after you understand the details is genius.&quot;
        5-Step
            &quot;A 5-step process for nearly anything:
            1) Explore widely. Find out what is possible.
            2) Test cheaply. Run small, quick experiments. Sample things.
            3) Edit ruthlessly. Focus on the best. Cut everything else.
            4) Repeat what works. Don't quit on a good idea.
            5) Return to 1.&quot;
    Me
        &quot;The quality of your life is determined by the problems you have to solve, while your potential is by the problems you want to solve.&quot;
        Know what you want and find what others want--Me
        I'm surrounded by children but I'm the only one comfortable showing it
        If I'm immature then why am I surrounded by children
    We do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors‚Äîwe borrow it from our children
    &quot;Content doesn't determine our happiness but context&quot;
        Vietnam Story
            It wasn't long before one American in the truck said, &quot;This place stinks.&quot; Another said, &quot;These people live just like animals.&quot; Finally, a young air force man said, &quot;Yeah, they got nothin' to live for; they may as well be dead.&quot;
            What could you say? It seemed true enough.
            
            But just then, an old sergeant in the truck spoke up. He was the quiet type who never said much. In fact, except for his uniform, he kind of reminded you of one of the tough men in the village. He looked at the young airman and said, &quot;You think they got nothin' to live for, do you? Well, if you are so sure, why don't you just take my knife, jump down off the back of this truck, and go try to kill one of them?&quot;
            
            There was dead silence in the truck. . . .
            
            The sergeant went on to say, &quot;I don't know either why they value their lives so much. Maybe it's those snotty nosed kids, or the women in the pantaloons. But whatever it is, they care about their lives and the lives of their loved ones, same as we Americans do. And if we don't stop talking bad about
            them, they will kick us out of this country!&quot;
            
            [A soldier] asked him what we Americans, with all our wealth, could do to prove our respect for the peasants' human equality despite their destitution. The sergeant answered easily, &quot;You got to be brave enough to jump off the back of this truck, knee deep in the mud and sheep dung. You got to have the courage to walk through this village with a smile on your face. And when you see the smelliest, scariest looking peasant, you got to be able to look him in the face and let him know, just with your eyes, that you know he is a man who hurts like you do, and hopes like you do, and wants for his kids just like we all do. It is that way or we lose.&quot;
            
            The code of the Ethical Warrior, even as an aspiration, shows that the American armed forces have come a long way from a time when its soldiers referred to Vietnamese peasants as gooks, slopes, and slants and when the military was slow to investigate atrocities against civilians such as the massacre at My Lai. As former Marine captain Jack Hoban, who helped to implement the Ethical Warrior program, wrote to me, &quot;When I first joined the Marines in the 1970s it was 'Kill, kill, kill.' The probability that there would have been an honor code that trained marines to be 'protectors of all others ‚Äî including the enemy, if possible' would have been o percent.&quot;
    
    Leadership
I‚Äôve always found it simple to make things complicated, but for me, writing is the opposite: it is the translation of the intangible to the tangible. My thoughts have had time over the years to become incredibly grand and complex, but that means I must expand my ability to condense these ideas into tiny words.
&quot;Not everyone's a king but anyone can wear the crown&quot;
