Habits / Perseverance #<a class="internal-link broken"> Perseverance</a>
&ldquo;What you do in the dark is what makes you shine in the light&rdquo;
&ldquo;You throw a bucket of water on a rock and it doesn&rsquo;t do anything. You let a drop of water fall onto a rock everyday, it creates a hole in that rock.&rdquo;
“You are only entitled to the action, never to its fruits.” - Bhagavad Gita, the ancient Sanskrit scripture
What has been done before, can be done again (The story of the four minute mile)
“When you&rsquo;re good at something, you&rsquo;ll tell everyone. When you&rsquo;re great at something, they&rsquo;ll tell you.”― Walter Payton
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t get what you want, it&rsquo;s a sign either that you did not seriously want it, or that you tried to bargain over the price.&rdquo; ―Rudyard Kipling
Fall Down 7 Times, Stand up 8
You&rsquo;re your best advocate. Don&rsquo;t also be your worst enemy.
&ldquo;What you do in the dark is what makes you shine in the light&rdquo;
Risk Taking #<a class="internal-link broken">Risk Taking</a>
The biggest risk is not taking any. The biggest failure is never failing. Ask the impossible questions. I am certain that there&rsquo;s a good chance that after this talk, many of you won&rsquo;t try. Statistics is not on your side. But that means that even wanting to be better makes you different, a minority that separates you from everyone else.
Be the best at what you do, or the only one doing it
The biggest risk is not taking one
Misc.<br>Nothing is boring. If you&rsquo;re bored you&rsquo;re boring</p><p>Interpersonal (Making Friends)
Making Friends / Caring
To the world you may be one person; but to one person you may be the world
&ldquo;Nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you care&rdquo; Theodore Roosevelt
If you want to make friends, make people feel better when you&rsquo;re with them than when you are not
“There isn’t anyone you couldn’t love once you’ve heard their story. ”― Mary Lou Kownacki
“Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it&rsquo;s thinking of yourself less.”― CS Lewis</p><pre><code>Conversation
    &quot;Speak only when you fully intend on finishing your sentence&quot; - Charisma in Command
    &quot;A good listener is one who helps us overhear ourselves.&quot; - Yahia Lababid
    Comforting
        “You do not get to make me extraordinary as an excuse not to succeed.” — Lisa Nichols.
</code></pre><p>James Clear
Praise others. It will bring them peace of mind. Do not expect others to praise you. It will bring you peace of mind.
Most failures are one-time costs. Most regrets are recurring costs. The pain of inaction stings longer than the pain of incorrect action.
&ldquo;Your success depends on the risks you take. Your survival depends on the risks you avoid.&rdquo;
Opportunity: &ldquo;If you spend too much time working on good things, then you don’t have much time left to work on great things.&rdquo; - James Clear
&ldquo;Procrastinating on something important is choosing to delay a better future.&rdquo;
“Most people don’t have trouble with focusing. They have trouble with deciding.”-James Clear
Asking Good Questions
The physicist Isidor Isaac Rabi on the importance of good questions (and good mothers):
“My mother made me a scientist without ever intending to.
Every other Jewish mother in Brooklyn would ask her child after school: &lsquo;So? Did you learn anything today?&rsquo;
But not my mother.
&lsquo;Izzy,&rsquo; she would say, &lsquo;did you ask a good question today?&rsquo;
That difference — asking good questions — made me become a scientist.”
Results vs. Lifestyle
&ldquo;In the long-run, the people who succeed are the ones who want to live the lifestyle that precedes the results.
Stop asking, &ldquo;What results do I want to have?&rdquo;
Start asking, &ldquo;What lifestyle do I want to live?&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s common to want results. It&rsquo;s rare to want the lifestyle.&rdquo;
“Winning is great, sure, but if you are really going to do something in life, the secret is learning how to lose. Nobody goes undefeated all the time. If you can pick up after a crushing defeat, and go on to win again, you are going to be a champion someday." &ndash;Wilma Rudolph
Taking Shots
&ldquo;A few things you need to achieve exceptional results:
1) Quantity: You take lots of shots.
2) Quality: You take thoughtful shots.
3) Consistency: You keep shooting for a long time.
4) Feedback. You take better shots over time.
5) Luck: You get a few favorable bounces.&rdquo;
Avoid Debt
&ldquo;Don’t spend what you haven’t earned.
Avoid financial debt. Don’t spend money you haven’t earned.
Avoid social debt. Don’t spend goodwill you haven’t earned.
Avoid calendar debt. Don’t spend (free) time you haven’t earned.
The disciplined earner can be a guilt-free spender.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Most people think they lack motivation when they really lack clarity.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What looks like talent is often careful preparation. What looks like skill is often persistent revision.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Rowing harder doesn&rsquo;t help if the boat is headed in the wrong direction.&rdquo; -Kenichi Ohmae
&ldquo;Feel compliments as deeply as you feel insults.&rdquo;
Reading vs. Reflection
&ldquo;Reading can teach you the best of what others already know.
Reflection can teach you the best of what only you can know.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Be radically proactive about any behavior that pays off in 10 years.&rdquo;
Ignorance vs. Genius
&ldquo;To simplify before you understand the details is ignorance.
To simplify after you understand the details is genius.&rdquo;
5-Step
&ldquo;A 5-step process for nearly anything:
1) Explore widely. Find out what is possible.
2) Test cheaply. Run small, quick experiments. Sample things.
3) Edit ruthlessly. Focus on the best. Cut everything else.
4) Repeat what works. Don&rsquo;t quit on a good idea.
5) Return to 1.&rdquo;
Me
&ldquo;The quality of your life is determined by the problems you have to solve, while your potential is by the problems you want to solve.&rdquo;
Know what you want and find what others want&ndash;Me
I&rsquo;m surrounded by children but I&rsquo;m the only one comfortable showing it
If I&rsquo;m immature then why am I surrounded by children
We do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors—we borrow it from our children
&ldquo;Content doesn&rsquo;t determine our happiness but context&rdquo;
Vietnam Story
It wasn&rsquo;t long before one American in the truck said, &ldquo;This place stinks.&rdquo; Another said, &ldquo;These people live just like animals.&rdquo; Finally, a young air force man said, &ldquo;Yeah, they got nothin&rsquo; to live for; they may as well be dead.&rdquo;
What could you say? It seemed true enough.</p><pre><code>    But just then, an old sergeant in the truck spoke up. He was the quiet type who never said much. In fact, except for his uniform, he kind of reminded you of one of the tough men in the village. He looked at the young airman and said, &quot;You think they got nothin' to live for, do you? Well, if you are so sure, why don't you just take my knife, jump down off the back of this truck, and go try to kill one of them?&quot;
    
    There was dead silence in the truck. . . .
    
    The sergeant went on to say, &quot;I don't know either why they value their lives so much. Maybe it's those snotty nosed kids, or the women in the pantaloons. But whatever it is, they care about their lives and the lives of their loved ones, same as we Americans do. And if we don't stop talking bad about
    them, they will kick us out of this country!&quot;
    
    [A soldier] asked him what we Americans, with all our wealth, could do to prove our respect for the peasants' human equality despite their destitution. The sergeant answered easily, &quot;You got to be brave enough to jump off the back of this truck, knee deep in the mud and sheep dung. You got to have the courage to walk through this village with a smile on your face. And when you see the smelliest, scariest looking peasant, you got to be able to look him in the face and let him know, just with your eyes, that you know he is a man who hurts like you do, and hopes like you do, and wants for his kids just like we all do. It is that way or we lose.&quot;
    
    The code of the Ethical Warrior, even as an aspiration, shows that the American armed forces have come a long way from a time when its soldiers referred to Vietnamese peasants as gooks, slopes, and slants and when the military was slow to investigate atrocities against civilians such as the massacre at My Lai. As former Marine captain Jack Hoban, who helped to implement the Ethical Warrior program, wrote to me, &quot;When I first joined the Marines in the 1970s it was 'Kill, kill, kill.' The probability that there would have been an honor code that trained marines to be 'protectors of all others — including the enemy, if possible' would have been o percent.&quot;
