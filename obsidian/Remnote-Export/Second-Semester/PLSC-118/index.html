Adolf Eichmann‚ÜîFled to Argentina, tried 20 years later in Jerusalem
Lecture 2 February 4th, 2021
Adolf Eichmann (2-37)
He admitted that while he was guilty of arranging the transport of millions of Jews to their deaths, he did not feel guilty of the consequences
Eichmann was kidnapped because of extradition laws in Argentina
He was placed behind a glass box to prevent assassination
The death penalty was resurrected
&ldquo;I never killed a Jew&rdquo;
Lack of evidence: There was only a shred such as &ldquo;Eichmann proposes shooting&rdquo;
Psychologists examined that he was totally normal
‚ÄúI will jump into my grave laughing, because the fact that I have the death of five million Jews [or ‚Äúenemies of the Reich,‚Äù as he always claimed to have said]on my conscience gives me extraordinary satisfaction.‚Äù
Eichman distorted the truth, such as saying he asked for a promotion to escape the job of killing others
&ldquo;Everyone could see that this man was not a monster, but it was difficult not to suspect he was a clown&rdquo; (25)
Eichmann had crises of conscience as the war came to an end (28)

Jeremy Bentham, ‚ÄúIntroduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation,‚Äù Chs. 1-3, 7 P
A useful extremist of classical utilitarianism
The principle of utility
Vain to talk of the interest of the community without understanding interest of individual
Features
Comprehensive and deterministic
comprehensive‚ÜìNothing it cannot explain
Objection: What if I do things for religious motivation? You follow religious motivation by pleasure
deterministic‚ÜîPredicts everything
Naturalistic‚ÜíWe are bound to the principle of utility by &ldquo;the natural constitution of the human frame&rdquo;. Physical source of pain is the fundamental drive for our behavior, and physical pain and pleasure drives u
Egoistic, but not subjectivist
Concerning oneself, self-interest
Objectivist view. You might not know why you do something, but scientists can distill your desires to a fundamental truth
Consequentialism‚ÜîOnly cares about outcome‚Äînot moral sense, natural law, rule of right
Quantifiable‚Üîby intensity, duration, certainty/uncertainty, remoteness (discount rate)
The question is not can they reason, but can they suffer?
Bentham considered animal suffering, which was ahead of his time
Karl Popper vs. R.N. Smart‚ÜîUtilitarianism cannot just be about minimizing suffering
benevolent explosion‚ÜîSmart&rsquo;s critique that if there was a painless way to kill all humans, then according to Popper, we should do it

You wouldn&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re being observed, and so you grow up always believing you&rsquo;re being watched
Bentham‚Äîwhy have government?
The disconnect between individual and social utility, or &ldquo;the market failure theory of government&rdquo;
Tragedy of commons‚Üîsomeone acting in their own self-interest hurts the general public

Bentham&rsquo;s two sources of rights
Practical equality requires a robust defense of individual rights for consequentialist reasons, rights help keep the pie large
Workmanship. The government does not itself produce utility, and so it must protect the workmanship of other individuals

Distributive radicalism of classical utilitiarianism
David Hume
Is / Ought problem‚ÜîIs does not imply ought

Ayer&rsquo;s Logical Positivism
Three kinds of assertions
Analytical truths
Empirical truths
Everything else = meaningless nonsense
Logical positivism versus legal positivism
Bentham argued there is no natural law
Entirely hinging on utilitarianism
Why Bentham argues that we should we have rights‚ÜîPractical equality. We want rights for consequentialist reasons
There is a degree of workmanship. So the government has a responsibility to protect those who craft value, its citizens
Bentham&rsquo;s radical ideas‚ÜîHe advocated individual and economic freedom, the separation of church and state, freedom of expression, equal rights for women, the right to divorce, and the decriminalising of homosexual acts. [My note: he lived from 1747-1832, well before most of these views were common.] He called for the abolition of slavery, the abolition of the death penalty, and the abolition of physical punishment, including that of children. He has also become known in recent years as an early advocate of animal rights.

Emotivism‚ÜîEthical and moral arguments simply describe your moral state/how you feel rather than what is

John Stuart Mill
On Liberty, Ch. 1-2
On the limiting of powers
The struggle between Liberty and Authority is the most conspicuous feature in the portions of history with which we are earliest familiar, particularly in that of Greece, Rome, and England. But in old times this contest was between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and the government. By liberty, was meant protection against the tyranny of the political rulers. The rulers were conceived (except in some of the popular governments of Greece) as in a necessarily antagonistic position to the people whom they ruled. They consisted of a governing One, or a governing tribe or caste, who derived their authority from inheritance or conquest, who, at all events, did not hold it at the pleasure of the governed, and whose supremacy men did not venture, perhaps did not desire, to contest, whatever precautions might be taken against its oppressive exercise. Their power was regarded as necessary, but also as highly dangerous; as a weapon which they would attempt to use against their subjects, no less than against external enemies. To prevent the weaker members of the community from being preyed upon by innumerable vultures, it was needful that there should be an animal of prey stronger than the rest, commissioned to keep them down. But as the king of the vultures would be no less bent upon preying on the flock than any of the minor harpies, it was indispensable to be in a perpetual attitude of defence against his beak and claws. The aim, therefore, of patriots, was to set limits to the power which the ruler should be suffered to exercise over the community; and this limitation was what they meant by liberty. It was attempted in two ways. First, by obtaining a recognition of certain immunities, called political liberties or rights, which it was to be regarded as a breach of duty in the ruler to infringe, and which if he did infringe, specific resistance, or general rebellion, was held to be justifiable. A second, and generally a later expedient, was the establishment of constitutional checks; by which the consent of the community, or of a body of some sort, supposed to represent its interests, was made a necessary condition to some of the more important acts of the governing power. To the first of these modes of limitation, the ruling power, in most European countries, was compelled, more or less, to submit. It was not so with the second; and to attain this, or when already in some degree possessed, to attain it more completely, became everywhere the principal object of the lovers of liberty. And so long as mankind were content to combat one enemy by another, and to be ruled by a master, on condition of being guaranteed more or less efficaciously against his tyranny, they did not carry their aspirations beyond this point
On the liberty of thought and discussion
The best government has no more title to it than the worst. It is as noxious, or more noxious, when exerted in accordance with public opinion, than when in or opposition to it. If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind

Therefore, the slave and master are slaves to each other and are mutually codependent

Commodities and exploitation
Under capitalism, everything becomes a commodity
People traditionally buy commodities in order to use them, but capitalists buy commodities to sell them for a profit
Capitalists are able to make a profit is that they only need to pay workers their value (how much it takes to keep them functional), but the workers produce more than that amount in a day. Thus, the workers are exploited
The capitalists are able to do this because they have more power, and control the means of production. Furthermore, the workers&rsquo; character is negatively affected by the system. They don&rsquo;t own the products of their labor, and the repetitive work they have to do makes them little more than machines
Use-value vs. exchange-value
Use value‚Üîthe utility derived
Exchange value‚Üîlong run pric
Exchange-value is rooted in how much labor-power went into them.
Constant vs. variable capital
Variable capital‚ÜîWages
Constant capital‚ÜîEverything else that a capitalist spends money on
SNLT‚ÜîSocially necessary labor time. The time needed to complete a task
Class in itself vs. class for itself
Class in itself‚ÜîObjectively defined, social group whose members share the same relationship to the means of production, like factory workers
Class for itself‚ÜîSubjectively defined, group who pursues interests
You are in the working class if you cannot survive unless you sell your capacity to work to someone else
Even if you have a retirement plan, you are still working class if dependent on working

</code></pre><p>Marx Discussion Section March 4th, 2021
My question: As Professor Shapiro mentioned in lecture, Marx can often be characterized as idealistic. How is this present in his language and concepts from the Manifesto of the Communist Party? Is this undermining, enhancing, or in fact an essential part of achieving Marx&rsquo;s rhetorical purposes? And does this undercurrent contradict his ideas such as the materialistic conception of history, which argues that society is driven not by ideals, but material conditions? Why do we remember the idealistic Marx rather than nuances of capitalist systems?
What about performative revolution
Ten Hours Bill
In the Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels reference the ten hours&rsquo; bill in England as a bourgeois appeal to the proletariat. However, rather than addressing how these appeals might erode working class solidarity or how that erosion might be addressed, they assume the appeals will only strengthen the working class and quickly move on. Why didn&rsquo;t Marx and Engels address this potential appeasement-oppression cycle further?
Would you not want reform to galvanize a revolution?
Is this an evolution from a Class in itself vs. class for itself ?

All historical predictions were wrong; false positives and false negatives
Never been a communist revolution in advanced capitalist system, only pre-capitalist or agrarian ones
Teleological view of history, that history has a direction is misguided
Cannot transcend scarcity (assumed that capitalism would produce endless wealth)
Welfare state

Comparisons
Marx encouraged workers to not compare themselves to other workers, but the capitalists who oversaw them
He&rsquo;s right that people create comparisons, but they don&rsquo;t create the global comparisons like Sanders and Marx suppose; they create comparisons to their peers
Superabundance
Wants vs. Needs
Needs
Oxygen, food, shelter

Discussion Section March 11th, 2021 Marx&rsquo;s shortcomings
Marx argues that the dictatorship of proletariat ‚Üí to a society of no state
Soviet Union focused too much on state than superabundance
Bao: I think although its hard to envision a stateless society now that doesn‚Äôt necessarily eschew the possibility of one developing way beyond our lifetimes (assuming human society persists that long)
Will: Like Professor Shapiro said, a teleological view of history is potentially erroneous in itself because it is a massive empirical assumption to think that history marches in some direction towards some &ldquo;finality&rdquo;
It‚Äôs a bit ironic that the only way to 100% disprove Marx‚Äôs idea and say that such a society or revolution is impossible, is in fact to adopt the teleological view of history or resort to some really broad generalization

Roemer: Should Marxists be interested in exploitation?
    4 interests in exploitation theory
        the accumulation theory: exploitation of workers explains profits and accumulation under capitalism; it is the secret of capitalist expansion.
        the domination theory: exploitation is intimately linked to the domination of workers by capitalists, especially at the point of production, and domination is an evil.
        the alienation theory: exploitation is a measure of the degree to which people are alienated under capitalism. The root of alienation is the separation of one‚Äôs labor from oneself. If one‚Äôs labor is put into goods which are produced for exchange (not for use by oneself or one‚Äôs community), that constitutes alienation. Exploitation occurs because some people alienate more labor than others. It is differential alienation.
        the inequality theory: exploitation is a measure and consequence of the underlying inequality in the ownership of the means of production, an inequality which is unjustified.
The hidden moral assumptions behind workmanship
    Marx's idea is a secularized version of self-ownership, that we own what we produce
    The corn theory of value‚ÜîTo produce anything requires corn. But we wouldn't say that corn owns everything
        object‚ÜîCommodities and humans are different
    Horse in the mineshaft‚Äîexploited, or not?
        Marx‚Äîthe difference between animals and humans is humans must work and this produces value, whereas animals exists and human labor creates value. Everything that is of value is created by humans
    Native American, the earth owns us rather than we own the earth‚Äîwe are not central agency as we suppose

</code></pre><p>Lecture 11 March 18th, 2021 Leviathan and Government
Locke&rsquo;s Second Treatise on Civil Government
People exchange natural rights into society with other people, to enjoy protection, etc.
People have right to dissolve their government
Government exists to serve the people
Hobbes&rsquo; Leviathan
Law of Nature‚ÜîGeneral rules for human self-preservation, condemn acts destructive to humanlife
rule 1‚ÜîOne ought to seek peace
rule 2‚ÜíDivest ourselves from certain rights (such as the right to kill others) to satisfy the first rule
Moral obligation
additional rules‚ÜíAll follow pattern, build upon each other, generally based off the The Golden Rule, Stealing an Umbrella
Laws of nature are not mandates of gov authority, but from natural reason
The natural lust of humans for power always threatens the safety of this contract, so they shall create a Common-wealth, Leviathan
Common-wealth, Leviathan
Law of nature is terrible
Mechanical appetites and aversions, which we escape through combining forces
Escape nature and provide peace for people
sovereign‚Üîperson or group of people responsible for defense
Two ways to establish
Acquisition (force)
Institution (agreement)
How natural man raises himself out of the state of nature
The Leviathan is an intervention, and a monster
One of the first political theories in English rather than Latin, to increase engagement
Not about what people agree to, but what rational people should agree to if thinking clearly
Hobbes does not believe that the social contract is between the ruler and the people. It is among the people to submit to the ruler
The people submit to any authority, because the alternative is the state of nature, which is lawlessness
Any state of nature is far worse than any amount or type of government
But there are limits
People are not obliged to die for the sovereign
You don&rsquo;t have to be bound if the state no longer protects you
Locke
Locke agrees that state of nature
State of nature is not necessarily defined by chaos, but autonomy
Consent is real, an actual agreement rather than a feature of rationality
Believed in common property, yet supported the enclosure movement‚Äîprobably because of productivity associated with enclosure; if everything was open we would just eat until exhausted resources
Lockean defense of welfare state
Everyone has an indefeasible right to at least as much as they could have produced for themselves
Defense of commonwealth
Everyone has a right to at least what they could have produced for themselves
Back to workmanship
We own the commonwealth because we make it
Unlike Hobbes, for Locke the contract does not extinguish the right to resist, short of death
Consent
Express consent‚ÜîIrrevocable, fully dedicated
Tacit consent‚ÜîYou have freedom to go out
We must use democracy and majority rule
Limitations on obedience to state
We subordinate ourselves to majority rule rather than a state itself
Depends on trust relationship that can be dissolved when it is violated
You cannot force a child to do anything because they never consented
The right to resist
You believe the ruler has violated the terms of agreement
You believe the ruler has violated the laws of nature
Perhaps you should resist as you wait for abuses, as people are infringed upon
The right to resist is high risk and high stakes, is not equivalent to civil disobedience
It&rsquo;s all or nothing, get the whole government</p><p>Discussion Section March 18th, 2021
Catherine
Feminist critique‚ÜîIf you create value through helping your husband, you create value!
Marx acknowledges that people have different abilities to contribute labor value, but this seems problematic
The impetus for creating contracts or the leviathan is self-preservation
I‚Äôm reading Moby Dick right now, and the Leviathan is this divine immensity that we both fear and desperately rely on
Hobbes: If you put in labor, its yours
Midterm Review March 19th, 2021
Bentham
Workmanship ideal‚Äîbased off the fact that God gives us the ability to lay claim to the Earth
Justified on consequentialist framework‚Äîwe do work to maximize pleasure and minimize suffering
No Natural Rights
We don&rsquo;t have natural rights
All rights should just maximize utility and physiological well-being
Free speech doesn&rsquo;t help anyone on a physiological level, so we shouldn&rsquo;t do it
Greatest Happiness Principle
Diminishing marginal utility
We have to distribute to absolute equality because of marginal utility
Practical and absolute equality
The government must spread out to absolute equality to maximize well-being
The government does not have a capacity to contribute, but to distribute
There is an objective measurement
Mill
Harm principle‚ÄîOnly do actions that don&rsquo;t harm others
The government cannot force individuals to do things that cause farm
Inherently conservative, bias towards status quo
Disagreement on unified objective measurement for Bentham
There are different types of pleasures, and lexical superiority
Chocolate bars and freedom
Richer view of freedom‚Äîpositive and negative liberty
Rights-utility synthesis
How do we get from rights to maximizing utility?
Freedom of speech should be allowed because it enables a marketplace of ideas
Explains how the harm principle leads to us maximize utility
Locke
Marx
Pareto
No method for comparing interpersonal utility
No science of morality
No scientific basis for making redistribution
Lecture 12 March 23rd, 2021
John Rawls
Unlikely figure in two ways
Political Philosophy is Dead (Weaknesses)
Utilitarian was stuck between subjective and objective
Marxism was vague, terrible in practice
Social contract, &ldquo;natural law&rdquo; is so vague
Political philosophy as practiced was a backwater in philosophy
Yet Rawls was able to
Singlehandedly revived first order theorizing about the fundamentals of political association
Became the dominant figure in philosophy in the English-speaking world during his lifetime
Jefferson believed that the earth belongs to the living, sunset clause of 19 years
Challenges for Classical Social Contract Theory and their answers
Nobody agrees on natural law ‚Üí Answered by Kantian ethics
There never was a social contract ‚Üí A hypothetical contract from John Rawls
Immanual Kant
Hypothetical Imperative‚Üî"If ‚Ä¶, then ‚Ä¶"
Categorical Imperative‚ÜîUniversal law, regardless of context
If everyone followed it, it would mean that the world would not fall into chaos
Does not necessarily support welfare

John Rawl&rsquo;s Main Contributions
Moral arbitrariness (instead of workmanship)
Nobody deserves the social position into which he or she is born
Moral luck, some people are more lucky? Nature and nurture affects our agency
A very non agent-centric view
Resources (instead of welfare)
Focus on resources instead of welfarism
In response to subjective util vs. objective util
Classical utilitarianism doesn&rsquo;t take the differences between people seriously
Neoclassical utilitarianism takes the differences between people to an extreme
Subjective is too weak
Objective is too strong
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s good for people is not good for other people&rdquo;
Let&rsquo;s change the subject
People have different conceptions of welfare, what&rsquo;s good for them
Focus on the resources that you want as a conception of what makes a good life for you
Deontological (instead of Teleological)
deontological‚ÜíDetermine what good is first, then distribute rights
teleological‚ÜîUtilitarianism is a teleological view. We will distribute rights in society without reference to the good
Lecture 13 March 25th, 2021
Rawl&rsquo;s Theory of judgement
Less arrogant justification of Hobbes
Hobbes thought that his argument was equivalent to geometric proof and must be right
If you read my book and disagree, you&rsquo;re just not clearly understanding the ruth
His key method: Reflective equilibrium
Rawl encouraged reflective thought equilibrium that you would naturally think mine is better
Veil of ignorance
Justice is blind
What you, in reflective equilibrium, conclude that people would choose behind the veil of ignorance

Liberties
Opportunities
Income & Wealth
Comparing Fundamentalist in United States vs. Nonfundamentalist in Iran
You must compare the worst of one system with the worst of another, not the best of one with the worst of the other
According to Rawls, Fundamentalists cannot claim that the US is bad because Iran would suit them better
You would need to compare how you are in US, vs. a Nonfundamentalist in IRran
The difference principle (Income & Wealth )

If you do not know if you are A or B (behind the veil of ignorance), you would still move from x to y because you cannot tell if you are going to be A or B , and the new worse off is still better off than the former better off
Discussion section March 25th, 2021
The categorical imperative should be completely divorced from empirical and what can be observed
Objection to Categorical Imperative
The way the categorical imperative is derived is from the outcome, which is empirical, even though it claims to ascend past that and be universal
If we accept the veracity of a statement, it must be absolute. The moment we defy a duty, we are trying to make an exception to ourselves which is not true
Truth is not equal to simplicity
How can a person with objective experience and subjective views ever derive an empircal rule?
John Rawls
What is justice?
Justice is the first virtue of a society
All societies are entitled to a reparation if they are unjust
Justice is blind
Against welfare state because it promotes poor mental state of beneficiaries
Property only democracy
Difference between utilitarianism‚ÜîDistributive justices
Justice as fairness
Lecture 14March 30th, 2021 Rawl&rsquo;s responses to criticism
Problems
Thin theory is thicker than Rawl admits
Rawl wants a theory that&rsquo;s thin with as few assumptions as possible
But you can&rsquo;t derive something from nothing. There are a bit of risk (from Harsanyi)
Chain connection and the Keynesian back door (from Shapiro, Rae)
Kantian argument is key but fails
Original position doesn&rsquo;t establish Rawl&rsquo;s theory; it&rsquo;s an expository device
Example: cake cutting
The one who cuts the cake should have the smallest slice
But what if one person is diabetic and the other are children?
Moral arbitrariness proves too much (Shapiro)
Moral arbitrariness proves too little (Hurley)
Students laughing at why nobody incorporated Rawls
explanation‚ÜîEnduring pluralism of values. Even if the most philosophically sound argument, there is still a bias that we have been inculcated
Rawls&rsquo;s responses to his weaknesses
John Rawls‚Äô alternative distributive principle, which he calls the Difference Principle, is examined next. The Difference Principle permits diverging from strict equality so long as the inequalities in question would make the least advantaged in society materially better off than they would be under strict equality. Some have thought that neither strict equality nor Rawls‚Äô Difference Principle capture the important moral roles of luck and responsibility. The ‚ÄúLuck Egalitarianism‚Äù literature comprises varying attempts to design distributive principles that are appropriately sensitive to considerations of responsibility and luck. Desert-based principles similarly emphasize the moral roles of responsibility and luck but are distinct because they approach these factors through claims about what people deserve because of their work.</p><pre><code>The unfairness of &quot;even if&quot; logic

Lecture 16 April 6th, 2021 Nozick Part 2
Marxists who have abandoned the labor theory of value
nonetheless affirm variants of the workmanship ideal
Nozick&rsquo;s overall goal
To establish the superiority of historical or procedure as &ldquo;rights as side constraints&rdquo; over &ldquo;patterned&rdquo; or &ldquo;end-state&rdquo; principles of Justice
Nozick thinks that unlike Rawls, he is the only real deontologist
Nozick&rsquo;s example‚ÄîChamberlain&rsquo;s deal
He negotiates a salary plus 25c per home game ticket
1,000,000 home game spectators, gains $250,000
Left critique of markets is that we pick the status quo
If the starting point is unjust, voluntary transactions do not confer legitimacy
Prostitute who has no other choice but to sell her body is a voluntary transaction but not &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo;
His response‚Äîyou pick any &ldquo;just&rdquo; status quo. They inevitably produce a result different from this status quo
This critique is a bluff
Where you start isn&rsquo;t important, because it will always change

</code></pre><p>Section April 15th, 2021 Burke
Burkian approach to reform
David Bromwich‚ÜîMartin Luther King, and other civil rights leaders, are Burkian rather than natural rights advocates
Are they using inherited tradition properly?
They are not proposing new ideas, but extensions to the existing system
This implies that rights have already been established properly . Instead, they just simply haven&rsquo;t been passed down properly
This is interesting because arguably, there is nothing wrong with the system, or a lack of rights. Instead, the system has just not been extended to the right groups of individual
If not an easier argument to make, it is at least more palatable
Whether or not something is a revolution is independent of it being Burkian or not

Similar to His key method: Reflective equilibrium of Rawls
Fishkin&rsquo;s alternative
Randomly selected groups who are representative of voters
They are paid to deliberate on something
Lecture 21 May 4th, 2021 Political Parties
Political parties have to discount everything they propose
Arbitration
Compromise
People take more extreme positions to get their way
Last offer arbitration
One makes final position, the other makes final position, and the arbitrator picks one or the other
Two parties are more like marriage, multiple party governments are more likely to be hookups
Strong vs. weak parties
strong party‚ÜíEveryone is on the same team
weak party‚Üíwe&rsquo;re not all on the same te
American parties are congenitally weak
separation of powers and history
Recent trend in many democracies has been to weaken parties
Direct election of party leaders
Election of James Corben, which the party cannot work with
Ballot initiatives, referenda, and plebiscites
Preferences for open list PR
Reforms to strengthen presidents
Primaries and caucuses
Problems with safe seats
Weakening of democracies

Two party forms coalition before election , multi party forms after
Final Paper
Hypothetical vs. Categorical Imperative
Question 1
Advantages
Wisdom, reliance on past (Burke)
Promotes self-interest of individuals
Hobbes‚Äîyou need a social contract to protect you
Rawls
Burke‚Äîyou want knowledge and tradition
Nozick‚Äîthe purpose of state is to preserve voluntary transactions. Nozick believes that once government has power monopoly, it will protect people without overextending. You need a lot of gov intervention to maintain only voluntary transactions
Douglas raye utility drift, once voluntary transaction drifts into oh shit movement. Opinions shift. Think wilt chamberlain. Also against unanimous decision because opinions change
Government derives its power from consent‚ÄîLocke
Hobbes believes the government should be able to have control, to keep people from killing each other
Hobbes says children are owned by parents and submitting to authority
Disadvantages of Social Contract
Oversimplification of consent
Hard to gov reform (Hobbes, Locke, Nozick)
To overthrow the government, you need majority
Even if I don&rsquo;t consent, I can&rsquo;t change it easily (Locke is interestingly resistant to changing government)
What about repugnant social contracts?
Bias towards status quo and outlasting generations
Jefferson believed that the earth belongs to the living, sunset clause of 19 years
In contrast, Burke was focused on decentering of the individual and respecting
&ldquo;Society is indeed a contract‚Ä¶ a partnership between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are yet to be born&rdquo; - Burke Reflections on the Revolution in France
In contrast to Jefferson believed that the earth belongs to the living, sunset clause of 19 years
Rights are inherited
The rights of Englishmen have been inherited over generations
The rights of man have not been inherited
Not &ldquo;what am I entitled to&rdquo; but &ldquo;what is expected of me?&rdquo;
&ldquo;A disposition to preserve, and an ability to improve, taken together, would be my standard of a statesman&rdquo; -Reflections on the Revolution in France
A government is like a ship at sea, cannot rebuild from scratch
Question 2
Locke‚Üî"The act of the majority passes for the act of the whole, and of course determines, as having by the law of nature and reason, the power of the whole&rdquo; -Second Treatise of Government
It&rsquo;s possible to interpret his words as realistic
Przeworski: Majority rule is a &ldquo;flexing of the muscles&rdquo;, a veiled threat or signaling that minority should align as they will surely lose
Majority rule is dangerous, fear of tyranny of majority rule Tocqueville
Madison&rsquo;s: Views on parties and majority rule
&ldquo;The latent causes of faction are‚Ä¶ sown in the nature of man‚Ä¶so strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts&rdquo; (Federalist #10)
Madison sought a society without factions
The worst faction distibution is the majority faction that tyrannizes
<a href=https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/b5rz0Lvow9aK6yBCaJ8srJFzUxznZVnB6HRFsoxZCS0x-I8ZH50ifHYnOa16K7UhEC1cULnxzAM-bxc8U71-9yFuAWFG_xPFEI3LY3RXyY5FlSJSMQkSAJg3J2_-y92Y.png rel=noopener>https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/b5rz0Lvow9aK6yBCaJ8srJFzUxznZVnB6HRFsoxZCS0x-I8ZH50ifHYnOa16K7UhEC1cULnxzAM-bxc8U71-9yFuAWFG_xPFEI3LY3RXyY5FlSJSMQkSAJg3J2_-y92Y.png</a>
The minority faction is incentivized to destroy the system or not participate it
Madison attempts to avoid factionalism
&ldquo;a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican government"‚Üîa larger democracy is better because it minimizes the likelihood of majority tyranny. Let&rsquo;s introduce more groups, more cross cutting cleavages. You can make it less probable that a majority of the whole will find a common motive, or to make it more difficult for them to find these similarities
to increase numerous cross-cutting cleavages which manages the effects of factions decrease the likelihood of tyranny of majority
Solution
pluralism
cross cutting cleavages
separation of powers
&ldquo;Ambition must be made to counteract ambition&rdquo; (Federalist #51)
Madison considered themselves to be building a &ldquo;non tyrannical Republic&rdquo; and not necessary a democracy
The people must be able to control the government
It is very easy to veto, controlling majority
Supermajority, separation of powers, bicameralism, federalism
Inefficient to legislate, efficient at maintaining the status quo
Schumpeter: Democracy is like shopping, or a market
different from‚ÜíMulti party systems
In the democratic method, &ldquo;individuals acquire the power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people&rsquo;s vote&rdquo;
Compete rather than divide up power. They gain temporary control to enact their agenda
Let the best system win

Institutionalizes Mill: Argument, not deliberation
Deliberation is consensus and getting agreement
Argument is about vying for temporary control, fight for undecided voters
<a class="internal-link broken">Median Voter Theorem</a>
Habermas&rsquo;s &ldquo;ideal speech situation&rdquo;
Criteria
Everyone has an equal opportunity to participate
Everone is free to assert, defend, or question any factual or normative claim
No one can be coerced into curtailing the rights specified in (1) and (2)
Everyone is motivated solely by the desire to reach an agreement about the truth of statements and the validity of norms
It&rsquo;s supposed to be a heuristic or hypothetical rather than practically enacted: What would an ideal speech situation conclude?
Key, Possibly Dangerous Assumptions
It&rsquo;s possible for people to agree about fundamentals
People are motivated to agree about fundamentals
Deliberation‚ÜîWe will seek people to converge and all agree. There is a common good, like Rousseau
Objections
What if we agree to disagree?
Deliberation can undermine agreement
marriage therapy‚ÜîWe realize we don&rsquo;t want to be together
gag theory‚ÜîWe just don&rsquo;t talk about these topics, because that ensures convergence
Fishkin&rsquo;s alternative
Deliberative polls
Random selection
In depth discussion
objections‚Üíhttps://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/q_IQ21TtM4vro91j9-zg8GKCCUaJJVnyCfpDZDYghC5gQ9raX7rVN3jD707Ypc1z7l_Mc1U2cjyNG5a5ZLa93mojUOZKjOEinnsNzh5Q-uamKqzRw4wbAk1oeeFmRXX_.png
Deliberative settings
Some people may appear more confident and skew the vote
You would have been better off asking the wisdom of the crowd instead of having the supposed &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; claiming he knows the answer
Rousseau&rsquo;s General Will
General Will vs. Will of All
General Will‚ÜîThe shared will of all, subtracting all areas of difference
Locke on the right to resist
Interestingly, he is harsh on resistance
Of the people, by the people, perhaps for the people‚Äîthey will think it&rsquo;s for the people
Rawls doesn&rsquo;t specify unanimity or a procedure for deciding</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3></h3><ul class=backlinks><li></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3></h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p></p><ul><li><a href=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/braden-w>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
