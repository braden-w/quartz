Anti-realism‚ÄïThere are no objective truths
Emotivism‚ÄïAn ethical theory that regards ethical and value judgements as expressions of feeling. Emotion is involved, I am expressing emotional approval or disapproval
Stevenson‚Äïviewed normative ethics as the most important branch of ethics, strong proponent of Emotivism<br>Realism‚ÄïFacts
&ldquo;Resultivism"‚ÜîWe care about results ultimately
Discussion 1 February 18th, 2021
The existence of multiple theorems does not imply there is no truth
Moral claims have truth value
The presence of multiple theorems does not imply there is no truth
String theory vs. loop theory
There is convergence, progress. This convergence is truth
Charles Purse
Math is a language of objective truth
Different notation of objective truth
Therefore, philosophy is language of objective truth
You could say language is the expression of belief, not truth
Societal values do not affect math, the way you are born does not affect math
Maybe some people are born less mathematically inclined?
Ethical language
Slavery ended only 50 years ago, in light of human existence
The existence of truth does not imply simplicity
Newton&rsquo;s laws of mechanics‚Äîthey thought it was super simple, but it gave rise to something far more complex in relativity and</p><pre><code>    Counterargument: You cannot assume that something is true until you observe it
        Who cares about the truth. The fact is, is the other side is abusing and assuming that we can believe there exists a truth as a truth when it doesn't exist
        In fact, the aff has a greater burden of proof. It doesn't matter
        Quantum mechanics‚Äîwe don't know until we observe
            Counterargument to this: There is a truth,
</code></pre><p>Lecture 2 February 10th, 2021
Intrinsically good vs. intrinsically bad
Instrumentally good vs. instrumentally bad
Lecture 3 February 15th, 2021
Quantitative vs. Qualitative hedonism
Quantitative hedonism‚ÜîMaximize pleasure, and maximize quantity * quality
Mill&rsquo;s objection‚Üînot all just quantity and intensity
Qualitative hedonism‚ÜîThere are certain high qualities of pleasure that are better, which are lexically superior
The experience machine
Reverse experience machine
Discussion 2 February 15th, 2021
Simulation machine
Why I am a hedonist: I am either in a simulation or being simulated too. In other words, the status quo I live in is equivalent to an experience machine. I will never find objective truth. Therefore, I might as well be in a simulation or experience machine
You might think that we do not have knowledge in the experience machine
‚ÜíWe already have no real knowledge in real life anyway
Privacy argument‚Äîsuppose it was legal to access someone&rsquo;s microphone at any time. Should that be illegal? Assuming they never find out. They never know, so why does it matter?
‚Üí
Truth is in potential for validation. That is, there is a chance a human stumbles upon it and observes in in the future. If it can be observed, it is true
Lecture 4 February 17th, 2021
Mill Chapter IV
The only proof capable of being given that an object is visible, is that people actually see it. The only proof that a sound is audible, is that people hear it: and so of the other sources of our experience. In like manner, I apprehend, the sole evidence it is possible to produce that anything is desirable, is that people do actually desire it
Desire for virtue
Even the pursuit of virtue is in fact a pursuit of utility
Preference theory
Does not explain why we desire the things we do
Well-being is a measure of having what you want
ACTUALLY having what you want
Lecture 5 February 24th, 2021
Instrumental good
Instrumentalist stories on behalf of the welfarist
Utilitarianism
Consequentialism‚ÜîWhat matters in determining right and wrong is bringing the best results
Bold‚ÜîOnly thing that matters is consequences
Pluralistic‚ÜîConsequences for many instead of few
Welfarism‚ÜîMeasuring right and wrong should be the welfare of individual people
strong welfarism‚ÜíThe only thing that matters is good and bad welfare
Does not include pluralistic ideas such as distribution
Equal total welfare, different distributions
Egalitarians must argue one is better
Welfarists must argue one is worse

Discussion 3
Equal total welfare, different distributions
Burden of proof
You could argue there is a badness, which traditional factors into negative well being
It&rsquo;s all factored in the total welfare
Everything has been rooted in the framework that what matters is total well-being. This helps the welfarists but not the egalitarians
Reallocating causes negation to total well-being
Marginal utility, a little for poor goes a long way
&mldr; All factored into equal of welfare
IQ Distribution
Lecture 6 March 3rd, 2021
Can we tell what your motives are? Do they matter?
Counterargument to utilitarianism‚ÜîHow do we know it&rsquo;s the best result? We should spend an inordinate amount of time calculating
Heuristic
Common-sense morality‚ÜîThe system of moral rules that we use in everyday life to make judgments about the character and actions of other people. And of ourselves, of course.
Subjective vs. Objective
Subjective is your personal motive, like I did the objectively right thing for the wrong subjective reason
Subjective right thing to do‚ÜîGive the poison labelled medicine
Objectivist right thing to do‚ÜîGive the medicine labelled poison
Lecture 7 March 8th, 2021
Utilitarian argument that there are exceptions
Mill Chapter 5
How does justice correlate or not to Utilitarianism
Introduction to Desert
Welfares could support Desert because it incentivizes those
Lecture 8 March 15th, 2021
Mill does not create a deeper foundation for utilitarianism, and so it is a fundamental foundational principle
Mill offers proof for utilitarianism, but qualifies that this type of proof is not necessarily intuitive

Critics of Mill says that he is making a enormous fallacy
Visible means can be seen, therefore x is visible
Audible means can be seen, therefore x is audible
Desirable means can be desired, therefore x is desirable
But Mill is saying that desirable means worthy of desire
They don&rsquo;t understand Mill&rsquo;s reasoning
I have to be able to hear or see it to be persuaded

Office Hours March 15th, 2021
Progress in Philosophy
Efficient transmission of
Shelly explored Desert deeply for 20 years
Ideas
Most efficient method to transmission
How to organize? Prune your tree
How to avoid idea collision
Area of science whose progress is most tied to philosophy
Comparison of philosophy to mathematics
dependence on axioms‚ÜîIf you accept axioms, then other things naturally follow
Interestingly, this is like a switch statement where entire branches of philosophy can follow
Desert‚ÜîThe idea that good guys deserve more and bad guys deserve less
Section March 15th, 2021
Doing vs. letting harm
I am skeptical of duality, whereas it is a gradation
50%
Direct causal chain of events
Common sense
What if we zoom out, and instead of examining causing harm at the event level, what about the entire level
We can draw the causal chain all the way to say that you have caused everything
What if we instead accepted that we all cause harm, and instead just sum them up?
Integral calculus of causality, the theoretical minimum amount of causality
Objection‚ÜîIs it a category distinction, or gradation?
Heap of rice problem‚ÜîMany rice is a heap, but what is the number that makes a heap?
If it is a gradation, it suffers from the Heap of rice problem
Section March 22nd, 2021
Rules
Ideal rules‚ÜîWhat is a rule?
Hiearchy of rules
If you perform a rule above in the hierarchy, you are justified
At the base,
Fundamental rules can be super complex and are not equal to their written form
The written rule is not equal to the fundamental rule. That is why there must be interpretation, and would be the only basis for having a judge
Collapse argument
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt steal‚Äù. If not absolute, becomes rule ‚Äúdon‚Äôt steal except when ‚Ä¶ or ‚Ä¶ or ‚Ä¶‚Äù is better than compliance with the simpler ‚Äúdon‚Äôt steal‚Äù. This point generalizes. In other words, for every situation where compliance with some rule would not produce the greatest expected good, rule-consequentialism seems driven to favor instead compliance with some amended rule that does not miss out on producing the greatest expected good in the case at hand. But if rule-consequentialism operates this way, then in practice it will end up requiring the very same acts that act-consequentialism requires.
Lecture 9-10 March 25th, 2021
Kantian Ethics
Based off rationality&mldr; what would a rational person do?
Maxim‚ÜîWhat you plan to do, stated in a proposition
A justification of an action
Foundationalism‚ÜîDescartes
Autonomy of reason
Lecture 11 March 29th, 2021
ULF
At the heart of immorality is cheating‚ÜîWanting to be able to play by a different rules than everyone else
Armchair philosophy
Psychology has nothing to benefit philosophy
If we&rsquo;re all rational, how do we still end up with different results on a math exam?
Section March 29th, 2021
Car to the hospital example
Adding justifications to it?
What defines a rationality?
What we only need, there is no standard for what is rationality
Instead, it is what we think is rational
The only requirement is that it is universally generalizable
Kant believed in the power of rational humans
Inclinations are not a grounds for ULF&rsquo;s because they create hypothetical rather than universal desires
We are attempting to align our subjective wills and irrational beings with the objective rationality
Lecture 12
The rugged individualist prefers to work alone whereas someone insists on helping him (Kantian)
What about &ldquo;you have to go to Yorkside?&rdquo;
Ununiversalizable maxim
It&rsquo;s not good for everyone to do this
There are numerous formulations of the Categorical Imperative
Lecture 13
What if we say only Shelly Kagans are allowed to kill?
The Golden Rule
Is it universalized for myself, or everyone else
The Formula of Humanity
Contains the command that we ought never to treat persons merely as means
Kantians believe we should treat people as an ends, rather than a means (like a slave or pen)
Who we consider rational or humans, and who we include in our moral rules
Superman technically would be included, even though he isn&rsquo;t human
Babies should technically not be included, because they can&rsquo;t think
Section
Maxims
Utilitarians vs Deontologists
Utilitarians have easier time saying what&rsquo;s good and what&rsquo;s bad, but struggle with rules
Deontologists have harder time saying what&rsquo;s good and what&rsquo;s bad, but can easily handle rules
How Hare approaches
Imagine I can or will live the lives of myself and everyone i interact with. What would I want to do?
He wants hardcore utilitarianism, because I&rsquo;ll live all the lives anyway
Wouldn&rsquo;t the ULF, if applied to everyone, not arrive to util?
Similar to the Veil of ignorance

Determinism and free wills
incompatibilists‚ÜíDeterminism and free will are incompatible
compatibilists‚ÜíDeterminism and free will are compatible
Determism vs. fatalism
Determinism‚ÜíEverything has a cause
Fatalism‚ÜîNothing you do matters
Fatalism is stupid (choosing a salad example)
&ldquo;Even if you picked the pizza, you would have eaten the salad&rdquo; is stupid
Lecture 15 April 12th, 2021
Repugnant suggestion: What if there is no cause? There&rsquo;s only randomness to everything
Quantum mechanics‚ÜîAt the core of the universe is not deterministic, but probabilistic
Incompatibilist
Denies determinism, but does it prove free will?
What defines free will? What is an account for it?
Reason sensitivity account
We are a product of our desires, and our desires are kinda malleable
We have reasons for everything, even if not moral
Free will vs. Divine foresight
If God knows everything, how do we have free will?

The point of history is for the universe to understand itself</p><p>Office Hours April 12th, 2021
It&rsquo;s fine to treat people as a means, as long as you also treat them as an ends. It is impermissible to treat them only as a means
Take them as a rational being
ULF vs. Formula of Humanity: One of them must arrive to it&rsquo;s okay to lie, and the other does not
Does the ULF really remove lying? We can still achieve success in spite of lying
Cheating example: I lied, but I showed complete respect to you as an autonomous being the entire time?
You can&rsquo;t destroy one&rsquo;s autonomy/capacity unless you hypnotize them
There&rsquo;s a difference between destroying autonomy and not respecting it
That&rsquo;s why Kant believed suicide was immoral‚Äîit destroys autonomy
But Kant believed that there&rsquo;s more to respecting autonomy than destroying it
Respect their ends‚Äîwhat if their ends was to have a meaningful relationship
To have a good life does not rely on complete information‚Äîdo we need to universalize not lying?
Intransitivity
If we define &ldquo;larger than&rdquo; as &ldquo;heavier or taller than&rdquo;, then we can easily arrive to an A is larger than B, B is larger than C, but C is larger than A
When we use multiple criteria, it&rsquo;s possible that some are more important when comparing two and some are less when comparing others
&ldquo;John is the father of Sam, Sam is the father of Bill, but John is not the father of Bill!&rdquo;</p><p>Section April 12th, 2021
Causality
Interesting‚ÄîI brought up the quantum example earlier before to say there are somethings we cannot know for certain
But determinism does not imply that we need to know all causes to accept that everything has a cause
Quantum - observing causes it to be heads
What if the act of observing in fact causes the state, heads or tails? Rather than the other way around?
The state is not heads or tails until we observe it
Therefore, we preserve causality of determinism. The quantum example still demonstrates causality
Parallel universes
If you accept that everything has a cause, then do you have to accept that everything was caused from the beginning?
Incompatibilist vs. compatibilist and the downstream tree
Clay Thames&rsquo; position‚Üí Everything behind me exerts cause of me because I&rsquo;m in their causal tree, but I have a causal tree which I control everything after
I have free will over everything downstream, and am influenced by everything upstream to me
Agent centric
Or you&rsquo;re just an interface that is taking in other causes and returning pre-conditioned actions</p><p>Lecture 16 April 14th, 2021 #<a class="internal-link broken">April 14th, 2021</a>
Autonomy and
kant‚ÜîYou are implicitly committing yourself to free will by believing it when you&rsquo;re making the action
numinal world‚ÜíThe world as it is, free of misguided interpretation we layer on top of the world
phenomenal world‚ÜíWhat we interpret about
Lecture 17 April 19th, 2021
Is‚Äìought problem
Hume critique of Rationalism
Our motivations are rooted in 1. desire and 2. belief
Motivation is created when desire + belief
Our moral beliefs can guide our actions
Why reasonists can&rsquo;t challenge desires and the subjectivity of desires‚Äîresponse to &ldquo;You should have certain desires&rdquo;
When our beliefs don&rsquo;t match the world, we change our beliefs
When our desires don&rsquo;t match the world, we change the world
Lecture 18 April 21st, 2021 Emotivism
When I say &ldquo;Murder is wrong&rdquo;, I am expressing desire more than belief
I am expressing my emotions
He&rsquo;s a normative utilitarian
You won&rsquo;t have morality until you have the relevant desires
Serl, deriving is from ought
Lecture 19 April 26th, 2021
Hobbes and the state of nature
Section
Maybe you should choose the objective heuristic, straight line from A to B instead of the subjective other pass. It&rsquo;s like guessing a number on a math problem. The answer is usually 0 or 1, so it&rsquo;s better to guess that than any other number, even if that&rsquo;s closer to the right answer
Are all laws based off morals? Laws organically arising from the state of nature
It&rsquo;s possible
Natural progress and certain ideas tend towards equilibrium
We are naturally randomly proceeding through different states, and some tend to stay in equilibrium better than others
Evolution applies to ideas and frameworks
Left handedness is constantly observed at 10%, as a balance between two conflicting forwards
Meme theory‚Äîideas propogate and reproduce using humans as their hosts, and the fittest ideas survive
What if the fact that we have utilitarian and kantianism is part of evolution? Perfect equilibrium is 30% util, 70% kantianism, etc.
Does Kantianism have a universalizeable outcome for the Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma?
Lecture 20 April 28th, 2021
Veil of ignorance vs. Kantian contractarians
Veil of ignorance is self-interested, but random distribution. The bargainers are not motivated by fairness, but self-interest
Kantian considers the lives of everyone, and then is motivated by fairness
To Kantians, everyone has to have a voice or avote
Kantians agree on fiarness but disagree on the mechanism
Ignorance vs. omniscience, but not really
Veil of ignorance is considering what a single person would vote for
Kantian considers what everyone votes for
Evolutionary skepticism philosophers
All of our ideas are
Evolution built us to believe not necessarily what is true, but what is
The selfish gene
Self-serving
Everything is about reproduction, so why does science and everything</p><p>Shelly Kagan Transitivity April 28th, 2021
Diminishing marginal utility
10 years vs 100 depending on the current number of years I&rsquo;m old
Multiple criteria of comparison
Objection to conception of infinity
Let&rsquo;s slap a number on everything to keep transitivity
Objections to infinity and Deena
Objection to pairwise or comparing everything at once
Why not average or mean? Even if the total sums were both ‚Äúequal‚Äù infinity, why not assign the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù or ‚Äúmean‚Äù as a tiebreaker
Lexically below on sum
Median
Infinity corrupts many of our arithmetic operations
Why not use statistics‚Äîif I were to pick randomly from this distribution and then iterate infinitely, what will I get?
This is numeric
It is similar to the veil of ignorance, how fitting!
Veil of ignorance, of course I want Pareto improvement
This sidesteps the need for certainty
M2 is still better than M1, even if not already in M1</p><p>Lecture 21 Why be moral? May 3rd, 2021
Ethical egoism‚ÜîEthics is all about promoting your self-interests
Weak, shelly doesn&rsquo;t like
Rational egoism‚ÜîRationality is all about promoting your self-interests
Examples of Ethical egoism vs. Rational egoism
Orange hair‚ÜîEthically permissable but rationally not
Cheating‚ÜîRationally permissable but ethically not
Is morality then really never rational?
Defense: It pays to be moral
1. Hobbes has already proven it?
2. Stick approach: There is punishment for this
God is the best example, that God will punish
You can be shunned, or society shuns you. Loss of cooperation from cooperation
Experiment: Transluscence
What if people were sufficiently transluscent, and we were sufficiently sharp to tell who&rsquo;s a cheater?
David Gotye‚ÜîHobbsi contractarian
The dominant strategy is a conditional cooperator
Rawls‚ÜîKantian contractarian
How to get from desires to morality
