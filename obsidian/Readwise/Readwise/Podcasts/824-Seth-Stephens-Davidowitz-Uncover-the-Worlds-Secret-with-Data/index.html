Summary:
i retired myself from my gougl search analytics and read every academic study i could find on big life decisions. The overarching lesson is that it&rsquo;s incredibly hard to predict who makes someone happy. You would think that, like many qualities about a person would dramatically improve the odds they make you happy. It seems in the datas, there are some things that moderately improve the odds, but they&rsquo;re not that big.

Yes, i basly just read, i kind of retired myself from my gougl search analytics and read every academic study i could find on big life decisions and what is the date to tell us and present that as trying to help people make better life decisions. The motive, one of the motivations of this is, amost a huge baseball fan. We talked about mony ball, and i kind of realize that baseball has changed so much, i since due to the mony ball revolution. When i was a kid, the game of baseball looked different, like the infielders all stood in the same spot in every play. And now every play the infielders are all over the place. There&rsquo;s something he infield shift, which data scientists discovered was actually a better way. It looks insane, but you put most the infielders on one side of the field, it actually leads to better outcomes. And iwas think about, like, our personal lives, and i feel like most of us don&rsquo;t really use data driven, make data driven decisions. We generally do what feels about right and go with our gut s a kind what would a a data, what w would a data driven a life be like? And i think the area where there&rsquo;s the clearest and the monyball analogy extends best is dating a. So tha, there have been studies. There&rsquo;s a work by samantha joel where she studied 11 thousand romantic couples. And she had, ever she worked with 85 other scientists. She had every possible trait you could measure on them, their sexual tastes, their demographics, their values a, their physical appearance, as ranked by other people. And she and how happy they reported being in that relationship. And she and the other scientists used machine learning to try to find what is it about a person that predicts ou &rsquo;re going to be happy in a relationship with them? And the overarching lesson is that it&rsquo;s incredibly hard to predict who makes someone happy. Like it&rsquo;s shockingly unpredictable. You would think that, like many qualities about a person would dramatically improve the odds they make you happy. And it seems in the datas, it&rsquo;s there are some things that moderately improve the odds, but they&rsquo;re not that big. And the striking thing about that study is you contrast that with scholars have studied on line dating, and they&rsquo;ve mined through, you know, everybody&rsquo;s cliques and messages, and they saya what makes someone desirable in on line dating. And that is incredibly easy to predict. So its it. It may be hard to predict who&rsquo;s a good romantic partner, but it is so easy to predict who&rsquo;s desirable partner. In fact, they can even predict with high accuracy, not just whether you&rsquo;r going to swipe left or right, but how long it&rsquo;s going to take you to swipe left or right. O if someone&rsquo;s close to your barometer, it&rsquo;s going to take you a little bit longer to make that decision. (

Summary:
Scientists used machine learning to find what is it about a person that predicts ou &rsquo;re going to be happy in a relationship with them. The overarching lesson is that it&rsquo;s incredibly hard to predict who makes someone happy. People are drawn to people who are similar themselves, even on silk seemly silly things like how many photos you include in your profile.

their physical appearance, as ranked by other people. And she and how happy they reported being in that relationship. And she and the other scientists used machine learning to try to find what is it about a person that predicts ou &rsquo;re going to be happy in a relationship with them? And the overarching lesson is that it&rsquo;s incredibly hard to predict who makes someone happy. Like it&rsquo;s shockingly unpredictable.

O if someone&rsquo;s close to your barometer, it&rsquo;s going to take you a little bit longer to make that decision. So, like we&rsquo;re just lemings on these online sits, and what predicts a, someone&rsquo;s more likely to be clicked? It&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re beautiful. Not surprising. That&rsquo;s by far the biggest predictor. It explains conventionally attractive people a way more desirable. Tall men, a each inch of height, th scholars have found, is worth about forty you have to make about forty thousand dollars of income as a man to overcome like one inh being one inch shorter. Certain occupations, not in women and men, lawyers, people in the ltary a do wegh better. In online dating. Students do horribly. I spent most o my life as a student and did horribly in dating. And now i know the reason for that. A, people work in transportation. A, inhospitality, disaster for men on dating sites, a similarity to oneselfa, people are drawnt. There&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s this idea that people are drawn to opposites. It&rsquo;s totally not true. On just about every dimension scholars can measure, people are drawn to people who are similar themselves, even on silk seemly silly things like how many photos you include in your profile. And my favorite, that people are 17 % more likely to match with someone who shares their initials on an online dating sight. Make totally ridiculous. If someone shares your initials, you&rsquo;re more likely to match with them, even take nto account everything else, like the religious background
