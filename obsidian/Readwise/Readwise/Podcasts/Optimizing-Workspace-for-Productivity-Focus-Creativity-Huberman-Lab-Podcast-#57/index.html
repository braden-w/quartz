Speaker 0: don&rsquo;t end up with any
Speaker 1: wealth left, whereas the people who store them on their
Speaker 0: wealth in the things that
Speaker 1: are hard to make, end up acquiring, end up maintaining their wealth
Speaker 0: and maybe even increasing it over
Speaker 1: Time. And of course this culminated in the 19th century, in the end of the 19th century by the basically the entire planet being on a gold standard, what
Speaker 0: is the gold standard?
Speaker 1: The gold standard is basically when money is gold or
Speaker 0: at least government
Speaker 1: currencies backed by gold, but the reason
Speaker 0: gold (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/62826de13782e70d2409d125 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:20:21</a>)</li><li>Speaker 1: that are
Speaker 0: monetary. So
Speaker 1: this is the money, This
Speaker 0: is this is the official money that you should be using
Speaker 1: if you live in this country. Yes. Although I would say it&rsquo;s more like the
Speaker 0: other way around. It&rsquo;s not that the
Speaker 1: government&rsquo;s established gold as money. It&rsquo;s
Speaker 0: more like the
Speaker 1: it&rsquo;s more like gold gave the government&rsquo;s the credibility for their currencies. So governments were not the ones that made gold money. Gold has been money before States were invented.
Speaker 0: Um States,
Speaker 1: if you have a
Speaker 0: government and you&rsquo;d like to have some
Speaker 1: legitimacy and you&rsquo;d like to be able to deal with other governments on an equal footing, you had to go by the gold standard, you have to have a currency that was redeemable in gold
Speaker 0: so that you could trade with the
Speaker 1: rest of the world so that people could um
Speaker 0: in your country (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/62826e843782e70d240a4af3 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:27:01</a>)</li><li>Speaker 1: you
Speaker 0: can&rsquo;t smoke it,
Speaker 1: you can&rsquo;t eat it.
Speaker 0: It&rsquo;s just
Speaker 1: it&rsquo;s supposed to
Speaker 0: represent, it&rsquo;s supposed
Speaker 1: to just be the medium
Speaker 0: of exchange. And
Speaker 1: um in that
Speaker 0: sense,
Speaker 1: what role
Speaker 0: does collective
Speaker 1: hallucination
Speaker 0: play in
Speaker 1: the effectiveness of money? Exactly
Speaker 0: zero.
Speaker 1: Because all of the paper money, first of all, there&rsquo;s never been an instance. And again um This is uh flies in the face of a lot of what a lot of people like to think about money. There&rsquo;s never been an instance where a government came out and said, alright, we&rsquo;re printing out these
Speaker 0: pieces of paper, used them
Speaker 1: As money and this one is worth 10 apples or use
Speaker 0: it for buying things.
Speaker 1: And here&rsquo;s the piece of paper. This has never happened. They&rsquo;ve always (

If you&rsquo;re very stressed about some sort of information or a deadline or you&rsquo;re very, very excited about something, you&rsquo;ll find that you can focus instantly just within a moment and that&rsquo;s because of the deployment of neurochemicals like dopamine and norepinephrine that bring about our levels of alertness. However, most of us, including myself, will go to begin a work about and we&rsquo;ll find that our mind doesn&rsquo;t quite engage at the level of depth and focus that we would like right off the bat. I&rsquo;ve timed this and other studies have timed this in a more rigorous way. Mine is just what we call an IQ data, but so I&rsquo;ve timed it for myself. But there are studies that have looked at this and the data point to the fact that even at our most heightened levels of focus, most people can only maintain focus before switching tasks for about three minutes, which is depressingly short (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/628271c43782e70d240cef9a rel=noopener>Time¬†0:34:36</a>)</li><li>Speaker 1: is one scientist to show that this relationship does not hold to do an experiment that shows that this does not hold and it stops being a law of chemistry and it&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s broken where? Whereas
Speaker 0: in
Speaker 1: economics, what they&rsquo;ve
Speaker 0: done is they&rsquo;ve
Speaker 1: copied the superficial shape of this without any
Speaker 0: of the
Speaker 1: scientific rigor that was used to build it. There&rsquo;s no experiments. You can&rsquo;t experiment on economies. We don&rsquo;t
Speaker 0: have the ability
Speaker 1: to establish laws and all the laws that we
Speaker 0: established are just models that get
Speaker 1: people published and get them on the media to say,
Speaker 0: my model
Speaker 1: says we need to print more money, but it&rsquo;s never subject to actual scientific scrutiny.
Speaker 0: If it were, they would all be rejected in 15
Speaker 1: minutes (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/628272773782e70d240d70d8 rel=noopener>Time¬†1:10:00</a>)</li><li>Speaker 0: is unlike
Speaker 1: physics, you know, which is let&rsquo;s force a bunch of particles to sit in the lab so that we can study them
Speaker 0: in
Speaker 1: economics. You&rsquo;re forcing people to do things, you know, let&rsquo;s stop these
Speaker 0: people from doing this job
Speaker 1: because it&rsquo;s bad for the economy. And let&rsquo;s get them to do that job. Let&rsquo;s force them to pay this price. Let&rsquo;s tax them this much. Let&rsquo;s prevent them from using gold
Speaker 0: as money and force them to
Speaker 1: use our credit as money. So it has to rely on coercion. There&rsquo;s no central planning without coercion. And coercion is a crime, in my opinion. There&rsquo;s no way that it is justifiable morally
Speaker 0: or ethically from a politics, from an ethical perspective. Um, your view is the I mean, perhaps
Speaker 1: the broadly speaking to the
Speaker 0: libertarian view is
Speaker 1: coercion
Speaker 0: is unethical. (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/628272873782e70d240d7def rel=noopener>Time¬†1:15:38</a>)</li><li>Speaker 0: Now, freedom is
Speaker 1: essential. What is what are the pros
Speaker 0: and cons of government intervention in
Speaker 1: the economy? So,
Speaker 0: can you steal me? Can you
Speaker 1: provide pros
Speaker 0: you just kind of
Speaker 1: provided arguments
Speaker 0: against?
Speaker 1: Is there
Speaker 0: any arguments to be
Speaker 1: made for government
Speaker 0: intervention for the
Speaker 1: role of government in
Speaker 0: society? Speaking from a political
Speaker 1: or from an
Speaker 0: economics perspective,
Speaker 1: what is a positive
Speaker 0: role of government that you
Speaker 1: can imagine, you can
Speaker 0: speak to. I can
Speaker 1: repeat many other cases, but I don&rsquo;t find any of them
Speaker 0: compelling for the reason that I
Speaker 1: mentioned, which is that
Speaker 0: ultimately they all
Speaker 1: rely on putting a gun to somebody&rsquo;s head and using the threat of force. So that&rsquo;s, for
Speaker 0: me, it can never be
Speaker 1: justifiable whatever the ends are. If the (
