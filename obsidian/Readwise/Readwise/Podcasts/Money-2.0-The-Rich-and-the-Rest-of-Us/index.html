There can also be issues like I think I&rsquo;m headed for a divorce, but I don&rsquo;t want my spouse to get half my assets. How do I hide those assets, preferably offshore. So that whatever is legally provable is mine is such a small amount that it&rsquo;s not worth fighting about.
Speaker 0: So, it&rsquo;s really interesting because these professionals in some ways get to know their clients better than the client&rsquo;s own family or friends or even their own spouse.
Speaker 2: Yes, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s apparently something of a cliche in the offshore world that The average client is a man in his 50s with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover, might be a common law wife and some Children, but they&rsquo;re usually all sorts of (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/62a0a6c63f707348d6f1452c rel=noopener>Time¬†0:03:54</a>)<ul><li>Note: Offshore Wealth Managers, and a lot of people approach them due to personal secrets</li></ul></li><li>Speaker 2: of smoked salmon straight from the factory in Scotland and was now calling David saying get me the salmon. And David said, well I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m your wealth manager, not your fishmonger. And the client said, well, today you&rsquo;re the fishmonger. And so David happens to know someone who knew the head of the smoked salmon factory in Scotland and he, he fulfilled the client&rsquo;s wish. And the client later told him, I basically made up that story. I wasn&rsquo;t sitting across from a japanese fellow who wanted 1000 sides of smoked salmon. I just needed to see that you had the connections and the will to do what I wanted when I wanted and not ask any questions.
Speaker 0: It was almost a test of his ability to jump in and sort of (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/62a0a6c63f707348d6f14528 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:07:17</a>)<ul><li>Note: Sometimes wealthy people ask others to do outlandish tasks to test loyalty</li></ul></li><li>Speaker 2: up a private markets for deals. So it&rsquo;s not uncommon for them to have several clients, each of whom owns incredibly valuable real estate, art collections, yachts, and so forth. And since these clients are very, very concerned about maintaining their privacy, they don&rsquo;t want to list these things on the open market for sale if they need to raise cash, they want to do the sales as quietly, as discreetly as possible with as little public recording as possible.
Speaker 0: One thing that I got from your book is that there are important ways in which the very rich are very much like the rest of us and ways in which they are not so wealthy people unsurprisingly turned out to have troubled marriages and we were Children just like you know, everybody else but wealth you argue (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/62a0a6c63f707348d6f1452a rel=noopener>Time¬†0:08:17</a>)<ul><li>Note: Wealth can exacerbate family issues (Money can‚Äôt buy happiness)</li></ul></li><li>Speaker 2: And he said, don&rsquo;t worry about it. And she said again, no, they&rsquo;re going to check my passport. They won&rsquo;t let me leave Switzerland, much less enter another country. I&rsquo;ve got to go home. And he said, no, really don&rsquo;t worry about it. So she didn&rsquo;t say anything further figuring, you know, it would be his problem if she got refused the right to leave. Sure enough, the private plane pulls up, they get on it. Nobody checks the passport, it lands in this other country outside europe. Nobody checks the passport. They get into the private car sent by the client. They&rsquo;re taken to the client&rsquo;s home, they have their meeting private car, takes them back to the private plane. Private plane flies them back to Switzerland. They get off the plane and go home. At no point has anyone encountered passport control or customs agent. (

They also, by the way, regard redistribution of collected tax as immoral because it creates um dependency on (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/62a0a80f3f707348d6f184d1 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:13:35</a>)<ul><li>Note: A lot of wrath managers believe they are doing good work</li></ul></li><li>Speaker 2: And I think that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why we&rsquo;re seeing a wave of leaks recently that some people are so troubled by what they&rsquo;re seeing, that they just can&rsquo;t stomach it any longer and they they blow the whistle often with dire personal consequences about a quarter of the people I interviewed, I would characterize as being conscience stricken about the larger impacts of their work. And they had a range of strategies to reconcile themselves to the implications of that for their own conscience. One of the ways that they dealt with it was to encourage their clients to donate to charity, to offset the negative impact of depriving the state of revenues. Other people I interviewed, including one gentleman in Panama City said he (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/62a0a80f3f707348d6f184e5 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:15:48</a>)<ul><li>Note: Some wealth managers are troubled by their work</li></ul></li><li>Speaker 2: but that&rsquo;s what happens throughout the lifetime of wealthy people. And so it breeds a kind of suspicion. Why do you want to be my friend? Why are you being nice to me? Are you just trying to get me to give you something? And that must be very unpleasant. And you can see how that would lead at the extreme to a sort of howard Hughes ian retreat or isolation from people. Because if you can&rsquo;t trust anyone, why bother.
Speaker 0: I mean the sad thing that you&rsquo;re saying is that the wealth manager might end up being perhaps among the very few people that a rich person can trust.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that seems to be a common story. It&rsquo;s wealthy people and their servants. It almost comes to the point where you can, if you&rsquo;re a wealthy person, you are more trusting of the people you pay to be in your service than the people you (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/62a0a6f23f707348d6f14dca rel=noopener>Time¬†0:18:16</a>)<ul><li>Note: As a wealthy person, it‚Äôs easier to trust people you pay than people you don‚Äôt. At least you know the boundaries of the relationship.</li></ul></li><li>Speaker 3: in my classroom, but the implications of what it meant to be one of the poor kids. And so I started thinking about myself differently. I started seeing my friends and my peers differently and all of a sudden this this relative difference between um me and the other free lunch kids versus those who paid for their lunch all of a sudden loomed larger than it ever had before, at least for me. And the interesting thing is, you know, that it&rsquo;s not like I was poorer the day after that than I was before, nothing objectively had changed. But because of that subjective awareness now, everything seemed different to me.
Speaker 0: I want to talk about a wonderful analogy that you&rsquo;ve (

I&rsquo;m barely keeping up with all the people around me, but this is this is this is how nearly everyone feels at every income level.
Speaker 3: That&rsquo;s right. And it&rsquo;s incredibly frustrating for ordinary people to read those kind of comments, but you can kind of see the psychology at work, right? Because um if you&rsquo;re a middle class person being frustrated at that new yorker saying that just think about how you&rsquo;re viewed by other people who are not middle class americans either, there are people who live in poorer countries around the world or there are people who are struggling to make ends meet in the United (

But you might be asking what about my stuff If you want to know how all those other hosts welcome guests into their home without worrying. Here&rsquo;s how air cover for hosts. (

Uh and it makes us more willing to seek out risks and engage in high risk, high reward sort of gambling behaviors. It also affects our bodies in ways that are similar to physical threats. So the social threat of feeling lower on the status ladder than somebody else provokes very similar reactions physiologically to a physical stressor. So we react as if we were about to be physically attacked. We react with stress responses as if we were about to face a literal physical challenge. And the (

<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/62a0a8ae3f707348d6f19c68 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:35:22</a>)</li><li>Speaker 3: people may not have their basic physical needs met. But when we look at wealthy countries like the countries of Western europe and North America poverty ceases to be the strong predictor of things like homicide rates and inequality becomes the stronger predictor because once people&rsquo;s basic physical needs are met, it becomes the relative comparisons to other people that becomes one of the major stressors that affect people.
Speaker 0: Now, of course, it&rsquo;s important to mention that some of these findings are correlations. You&rsquo;re basically looking at patterns, you&rsquo;re not actually conducting an experiment where you&rsquo;re varying how unequal people are and then measuring the outcomes and things like homicide. But tell me about another correlation that people have looked at that has to do with politics. The relationship (

But tell me about another correlation that people have looked at that has to do with politics. The relationship between inequality and political polarization.
Speaker 3: If you compare either across countries or within the United States over time, you see a pretty strong correlation between the level of income inequality and the level of political polarization. So it&rsquo;s not that inequality makes people more conservative or more liberal uh per se it&rsquo;s that people who are (

Speaker 0: you know, as I was preparing for this interview, keith, I came by this interesting study that Daniel&rsquo;s ISO had conducted. He gave money to Volunteers, some got more, some got less. And he found that Volunteers were willing to spend their own money if it allowed them to reduce the money that other people had. Zizzo called this burning other people&rsquo;s money. And he found that a substantial number of people were willing to reduce their own wealth if they could also reduce the wealth of other people. In other words, inequality has such strong effects on us that we are willing to make great sacrifices to level the playing field.
Speaker 3: And from an economic point of view, that&rsquo;s just (

In other words, inequality has such strong effects on us that we are willing to make great sacrifices to level the playing field.
Speaker 3: And from an economic point of view, that&rsquo;s just crazy behavior, right? But from a psychological point of view, it makes perfect sense because we&rsquo;re not judging these things the way an accountant or an economist would we&rsquo;re thinking, what do I have compared to what that other guy has and that relative sense of of um (

Speaker 0: Universally, people preferred the first option to the second. The survey, which was conducted in 2005, found that of those who had voted in the last presidential election, 90% of those who voted for a Republican and 94% who voted for a Democrat said they preferred option one to option two. I asked keith why this preference for equality doesn&rsquo;t get translated into policy? What explains the mismatch between what we say we want
Speaker 4: and what we do?
Speaker 3: Well, the important thing in that study was that the the charts demonstrating those different levels of inequality were not labeled right? And so if you were to (

Speaker 1: One
Speaker 4: of the places
Speaker 0: where you can see this tension between meritocracy and fairness is in the world of professional sports. In 2019, the Los Angeles Angels awarded baseball player Mike trout a contract worth more than $400 million. I asked keith if he thought the Angels we&rsquo;re paying my trout too much
Speaker 3: Well. If you look at teams, whether it&rsquo;s baseball or basketball that have extreme levels of inequality which are driven by paying superstars, astronomical salaries, they don&rsquo;t outperform other teams that have more equality. And that&rsquo;s (

Speaker 3: Well. If you look at teams, whether it&rsquo;s baseball or basketball that have extreme levels of inequality which are driven by paying superstars, astronomical salaries, they don&rsquo;t outperform other teams that have more equality. And that&rsquo;s counter intuitive. If you think that paying the superstars huge salaries means (

And that&rsquo;s counter intuitive. If you think that paying the superstars huge salaries means that they&rsquo;re going to, you know, work harder and perform better. You would expect better scores and more wins. But in fact, in team sports like that, higher levels of inequality and extreme pay for the superstars is associated with poorer performance in subsequent seasons.
Speaker 0: And of course, this idea might be explained by what you said earlier, which is that even if you buy the idea that maybe the superstar does (

The newspaper, the sacramento bee published the salaries of every California state employee. What happened when people discovered that they were being paid less or more than other people who are working for the state of California?
Speaker 3: The effects of learning, um, what you made in comparison to what other people made depended on whether you are a high earner or a low earner to begin with. So people who were below average when they learned that other people were making much more than them, they felt very dissatisfied people who uh, were higher up when they found out how well they were doing compared to other people, ironically, it didn&rsquo;t have the same effect.
