Speaker 2: Many leaders try to prevent errors by building cultures of perfectionism, failure is an occasion for punishment. Mistakes are a cause for firings, but research reveals that this approach is counterproductive. It doesn&rsquo;t stop people from making mistakes. It leads them to hide their mistakes. You don&rsquo;t want to penalize imperfection. You want to normalize communication about (

And then what happens is that you start doing everything else wrong and then you start believing that you can&rsquo;t do anything right.
Speaker 2: Eric taught us four key techniques for managing perfectionism. He anticipated much of what psychologists have discovered in the data and those lessons have come in handy in my work life. They help me avoid the mistakes I made in diving first recognize that excellence does not require perfection. Evidence shows that it&rsquo;s aiming high, not pursuing perfection. That gets results

Speaker 1: when you set goals for yourself. What you need to make sure that you understand is exactly what do you need to do to achieve those goals? One of my divers she said I want to be the state champion. Okay, great. How many points do you think you have to score to win the state championship meet? And she said, Oh I don&rsquo;t know, probably about 450. The highest score was about 375 but had gone as low as about 360. So now we know on average 3 70 has won the meet. And what it worked out too is that she had to score 6.5 on her (

And she said, and I remembered about a conversation. If I can just return to my averages, I&rsquo;ll be okay.
Speaker 2: I love the strategy of just clarifying the goal which then makes you realize perfect is not the target, right? And it&rsquo;s not even necessary
Speaker 1: Even though it&rsquo;s said to be the perfect 10 in judging, we remind the judges over and over again that 10 is not perfect. 10 is the top of the scale and it&rsquo;s described as very good in one scale of judging and excellent in the other.
Speaker 2: If you&rsquo;re in customer service, it&rsquo;s not realistic to shoot for 100% (

This is eric best, the long time diving coach at michigan state university. He&rsquo;s been the big ten coach of the year, and he&rsquo;s now coaching multiple olympic metalists at indiana. There
Speaker 3
is the one guy that i coach. He wanted everything to be so perfect. There&rsquo;s a thing in diving called a back you start your motion to do the dive, and then you stop before you complete the dive. Well, he had a lot of problems with balking. I would spend hours and hours watching this guy waste a lot of his this time, yes, i am talking about adam grant, guilty as judge. I
Speaker 1
never thought about it as an expression of perfectionism. Oh, yas, but you&rsquo;re right. You
Speaker 3
would do that on the most basic dive. I look at the back as a manifestation of everything is not perfect up to this point. So i can&rsquo;t do the perfect dive from here. And because i can&rsquo;t do e perfect dive from here, i&rsquo;m going to re start. (

exposed my perfectionism, but it also taught me to manage it. I learned that instead of aiming for perfection, it&rsquo;s healthier and more effective to strive for excellence. I adam, and this is work, like my podcast with the ted audio collective, i&rsquo;m an organizational psychologist. I study how to make work not suck. In this show, i take you inside the minds of fascinating people to help us rethink how we work, lead and live to day the psychology of perfectionism and how to overcome it. Thanks to service. Now for sponsor. In this episode, growing up, my mam told me that no matter what grade i got in school, as long as i did my best, she would be proud of me. And then she added, but if you didn&rsquo;t get an a, i&rsquo;ll know you didn&rsquo;t do your best. It made it clear that i shouldn&rsquo;t settle for any less than perfect. Striving to do your best is a good thing. In many jobs, success depends on avoiding errors. You probably wouldn&rsquo;t want a surgeon or a pilot who didn&rsquo;t mind making mistakes. But there&rsquo;s a big difference between valuing excellence and being a perfectionist. Striving for excellence is pursuing high standards of quality. Perfectionism is very ferent. And i&rsquo;m not talking about that time and a job interview when you said, my greatest weakness is that i am too much of a perfectionist. We&rsquo;re gong to talk about this like a true perfectionist would, with precision. (

Summary:
A famous correction psychologist said the perfectionism this an enterently impossible goal. Something that is inherently impossible cannot be healthy. When things are going well, perfectionism kind of keeps us ticken over and its not overly problematic. It can spur high performance under certain circumstances. But it&rsquo;s really difficult to make a case that this is something that&rsquo;s in any way positive.

Those
Speaker 2
distinctions don&rsquo;t stand upverya famous correction psychologist said the perfectionism this an enterently impossible goal. Something that is inherently impossible cannot be healthy. Personally,
Speaker 1
i have found perfectionistic strivings of saying, i want to make this as close to perfect as possible, more motivating and probably more constructive than perfectionistic concerns, where i&rsquo;m constantly worried that i&rsquo;mi to fall short of perfect. I think you&rsquo;re saying that still, both of those are probably not healthy.
Speaker 2
It would ever argue, certainly not me, that we shouldn&rsquo;t be trying to be more conscientious, more diligent, more flexible, perseveremon. But itis very different to perfectionism as one trying to make the links here between what&rsquo;s going on in broader culture, because that&rsquo;s where it starts. All the perfections to behaviour that we see are ultimately involved in trying to repair what we think is defective. Once we view perfectionism from this angle, it&rsquo;s really difficult to make a case that this is something that&rsquo;s in any way positive. You&rsquo;re
Speaker 1
reminding me of a medo analysis that my colleague, danna horrari, published, showing that perfectionism predicted higher performance in school, but not in work. When
Speaker 2
things are going well, perfectionism kind of keeps us ticken over and its not overly problematic. It can spur high performance under certain circumstances. It&rsquo;s something that could have performance benefit. (

Summary:
If you are a perfectionist, how do you break free from the rumination while still striving to do your best? It boils down to our relationship with failure. Failure is the great taboo. There are some very real pressures that we feel that create a sense that we must conceal our failure. You can&rsquo;t allow faiure to sip. You have to squash it with the ion fist of redemption and conore cycle it into growth.

Speaker 2
having. It boils down to our relationship with failure. At the moment. Failure is the great taboo. There are some very real pressures that we feel that create a sense that we must conceal our failure, because whenever we push out there, society can often stamp us down. Wed need to slow down, and we need to accept that we&rsquo;re going to fail, and we&rsquo;re going to fail many, many times. You know, this kind of fail better movement, it doesn&rsquo;t matter that you&rsquo;ve failed, sitting comfortably before you in this culture is really not an easy thing to do. It&rsquo;s a really brave thing to do. Actually. It&rsquo;s so crucial that individually we&rsquo;re able to break down some of those dencies, but also culturally, we&rsquo;re placed in environments where people are able to accept and embrace flows. And if we can get that right, then these sorts of issues that we&rsquo;re seeing will fade awaynd then you&rsquo;ll begin to see that you can still have high standards, and you can still shoot for really high goals, but you can do so without the emotional baggage, the cognitive baggage that comes with a perfectionistic tendency to perfectionistic thinking. You can&rsquo;t allow faiure to sip. You have to squash it with the ion fist of redemption. You have to conore cycle it into growth. (

Summary:
It&rsquo;s almost like giving people a tonic. Once you release something and you share it with other people, a likeness comes to it. You realize that maybe it&rsquo;s not quite such a catastrophic sit ation as you saw. Many leaders try to prevent errors by building cultures of perfectionism. But research reveals that this approach is counterproductive. It doesn&rsquo;t stop people from making mistakes but leads them to hide their mistakes.

one directors, i remember him sharing why the pitch had been lost, and then another opportunity was won not long afterwards. He says, i can directly attribute vocalizing that learning around why we lost that pitch for our services and what we got wrong, to then bringing that into what was then a winning pitch for a different client afterwards. What
Speaker 1
was it about vocalizing it that led tohe growth or learning? It&rsquo;s
Speaker 4
that process of sharing something that&rsquo;s a real visceral thing that happens in your body a lot more than if you just shared it in one to one with somebody like you. Going to remember that a lot more than if you just made a little note in your learning log. It&rsquo;s almost like giving people a tonic. Once you release something and you share it with other people, a likeness comes to it. You realize that maybe it&rsquo;s not quite such a catastrophic sit ation as you saw. And overtime, doing that on a regular basis brings down that level of catastrophiation, if you like, around mistakes and errors in these experiences that maybe feel more awkward to navigate than when the good times are rolling, as they were.

You could start small, ok? And you can set the boundaries around the kind of fails, okaso that should talk about day to day things, or just what you feel comfortable sharing. Really, the most important thing here is that the person who is running this leads by example. And you just be clear that there are going to be no re percussions for what gets shared here. But you know, there might be discussions afterwards. It&rsquo;s not a case of, if you make akand you share it in this forum, there are no consequences. (

You need strategies for dealing with perfectionism within yourself, which is about normalizing your own mistakes and failures. Personally, i it helpful to adopt anti perfectionism. I aim to fail a few times a year. Yep, i have a fail quota. What else would you expect a recovering perfectionist to do? I want to get as good as humanly possible at failing. If i haven&rsquo;t had at least three projects flop at the end of the year, i know i&rsquo;ve just been repeating what i&rsquo;m already good at and staying in my comfort zone. Having an article rejected, study bomb and a speech fall flat is a sign that i&rsquo;m pushing myself to try new things. It also cushions the blow when i crash and burn. I can check it off as one of my expected fails for the year. You need that outlet, especially if you&rsquo;re used to measuring yourself against an impossible ideal. My

A great question. For me, the biggest things are overthinking everything and then over thinking them again later that night or the next week. I don&rsquo;t know if starting gymnastics at such a young age turned me into a perfectionist, or if my perfectionist tendencies kind of helped me gravitate toward the sportive, gymnastics and then the sportive diving. Half
Speaker 1
way through college, jordan ran into a big problem with her back one and a half. It
Speaker 5
was a dive that i had been doing for five years at hipoint, and it was just all of a sudden i had this huge mental block, and my brain couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to do it. Couldn&rsquo;t think how i ever did it.
Speaker 1
So you&rsquo;re standing backward on the board. Yes, you&rsquo;re supposed to do a back flip and then a dive. Correct what happens instead? (
