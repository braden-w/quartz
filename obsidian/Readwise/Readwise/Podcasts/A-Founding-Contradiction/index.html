Summary:
In the movies 17 76, there&rsquo;s a scene that shows jefferson debating the issue with edward rutledge. I asked anetwh the scene is historically accurate. Was jefferson prevented from getting anti slavery language into the declaration of independence because he himself was personally compromised as a slaveholder? It wasn&rsquo;t about jefferson&rsquo;s ownership of slaves that made them excise this. People thought it was not the thing to do at this moment,. So better to just leave that passage out. And they took it out.

Jefferson
Speaker 2
tried to push america in the direction of this better society. As he was writing the declaration of independence, he ac used briton&rsquo;s king george of perpetuating the international slave trade, what jefferson called execrable commerce. This reference to a detestable practice was removed from the final version of the declaration. In the movies 17 76, there&rsquo;s a scene that shows jefferson debating the issue with edward rutledge, a member of the continental congress from south carolina.
Speaker 7
I tell you, the rights of human nature are deeply wounded by this infamous practicean see to your own wounds, mister jefferson. For you are a practitioner, are you not? I
Speaker 2
asked anetwh the scene is historically accurate. Was jefferson prevented from getting anti slavery language into the declaration of independence because he himself was personally compromised as a slaveholder? I
Speaker 1
don&rsquo;t think he was prevented because of his involvement in slavery. It was taken out because people thought it was too in dary. It offended members of the death south. So it wasn&rsquo;t about jefferson&rsquo;s ownership of slaves that made them excise this. It was that people thought it was not the thing to do at this moment, that it was too incendiary, that it was a mark against people who were slaveholders, all slaveholders. So better to just leave that passage out. And they took it out. And he was very, very angry about that and other changes that they made to to the draft.
Speaker 2
So when jefferson and folks like him were angry, was part of their reasoning, you know, we really want this end, but it&rsquo;s more important for us to all in a hole together, because we&rsquo;re actually fighting this revolutionary war, and that&rsquo;s the more important goal that has to be accomplished first, before we can get to this secondary goal of basically abolishing slavery.

Summary:
When jefferson went to paris in 17 84, he took a man named james hemmings with him. So there was some tension here, because france, at the time, was in resounding with the cries of liberty and equality. But once ames takes over the roll as the chef de grisine, he begins to pay him. He handles it by treating james as if he were a regular servant, and instead of an enslaved person.

Speaker 2
ambivilence toward slavery became even more difficult to navigate after jefferson went to paris in 17 84 on behalf of the new us. Government. When
Speaker 1
jefferson went to paris, he took a man named james hemmings, who was a tenager, 18, 19 years old at the time. And he took james with him to have james trained as a chef, a french chef.
Speaker 2
So there was some tension here, because france, of course, at the time, was in resounding with the cries of liberty and equality. And jefferson, in some ways, embraced french revolutionary fervor. But how did he manage that embrace of the revolution with the slaves he had in his own household?
Speaker 1
The way he handled enslaved people? And our james hemmings, when he was in france, had much more to do with french law, which at the time, was on the side of the enslaved person. I mean, people who petitioned for freedom in france, people who had been brought the colonies and so forth, or other enslaved people who were brought there from other places who petitioned for freedom, had those petitions granted routinely. So when he&rsquo;s there with james hemmings, he knows that it&rsquo;s possible that james might at some point petition for his freedom. So he handles, i think, although he doesn&rsquo;t say this, but this is the time when he begins to pay james hemming&rsquo;s regular wages. James becomes the chef de cuisine at the hotel de langiac, jefferson&rsquo;s residence. Before he had been giving james spending money or gratuities. But once ames takes over the roll as the chef de grisine, he begins to pay him. So i think he handles it by treating james as if he were a regular servant, and instead of an enslaved person. (

Summary:
Sally hemmings is the sister of robert hemmings, who was by his side as he drafted the declaration of independence. When jefferson ink that he wants to come home, she wanted to stay in france. Why would you give up essentially freedom in france to come back and be a slave in virginia? I thought about quite a bit when i wrote my first book,. That was sort of a point of mystery for me, about s Sally hemmings.
Transcript:
Speaker 2
Jefferson&rsquo;s wife had died by the time he got to france. At one point, a young slave is brought over from the united states. She is actual the sister of robert hemmings, who was by his side as he drafted the declaration of independence. Who was she and what did she become to jefferson? Well,
Speaker 1
sally hemmings, sarah, a nicknamed sally, was sister to robert annd james. She had been something of a companion to jefferson&rsquo;s so she went along, and she was 14. And while she was there, we don&rsquo;t know when she became jeffersons. And their son says, concubine is the term that he uses. And she became pregnant by jefferson, and she wanted to stay in france. By the time jefferson ink that he wants to come home, she wanted to stay. And actually, all the young people in the hotel de langiac wanted to stay in france. Nobody wanted to go home. But jefferson promised her that if she came back with him, she would have a good life at montecallo, and their children would be freed when they were 21 years old. So she agreed to that. She was 16 years old at the time, and she came back to virginia with jefferson.
Speaker 2
So for us, at least with the vantage of history, this seems almost incomprehensible as a decision. Why would you give up essentially freedom in france to come back and be a slave in virginia? I
Speaker 1
thought about quite a bit when i wrote my first book. That was sort of a point of mystery for me, about sally hemmings. But when i started writing the hemmings o monticello and working on that, and i realized how important family was or i began to think about how important family would have been to some one like that, a 16 year old female raised to believe that she had some special connection to family. In a way, to think about family, think about your mother is back in virginia. Her sisters and brothers were there. So that would be an impetus an that was sort of a dilemma that many slave people faced. Do you run away and have freedom by yourself, or do you stay and stick it out with your family? The other thing to consider is that jefferson treated sally hemmings and her sisters and brothers very differently than he did the other aves on the mountain. (

Summary:
The age of consent ing virginia at the time was ten, and they raised it 12 in the 18 twenties. And it was that way through the nineteenth century and most the states of the union. So a 16 year old person, to us is like a baby. But a 16 year old person at that time would not have been thought of as a child.

Summary:
The idea that a man would have a mistress or a companion was normal in virginia. A one of jefferson&rsquo;s friends said it was a common practice for a widowed or bachelor slave owners to take an enslaved woman as, and he uses the phrase, a substitute for a wife. mixed children, these kinds of connections from rape, two sort of long terme liaisons, however you want to call them, were a part of slave societies. And they have been in every slave society that has ever existed.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
Well, because he was the patriarch of montecallo. And in those days, it was much more than father knows best what he said would go, because he was the head of the household. I think it is also important to remember that jefferson had two surviving daughters with his wife, who died in 17 82. So i think he handled it by being the boss, and it was the kind of thing that people would not question. So he had basically the freedom to impose a kind of order on this place that everybody went along with. Plus, you have to remember, i think we have to remember, that he wasn&rsquo;t married. And the idea that a man would have a mistress or a companion, or that he would have a set up like this, was normal in virginia. It was not considered crazy. A one of jefferson&rsquo;s friends that it was a common practice for a widowed or bachelor slave owners to take an enslaved woman as, and he uses the phrase, a substitute for a wife. Obviously, she couldn&rsquo;t be a wife, because they couldn&rsquo;t marry black people. And white people could not get married. Well, until 19 67, in virginia. So that was out of the question. But this was something that happened in slavery, an it&rsquo;s hard for us to wrap our minds around, just as it might be hard for us to wrap our minds around about slavery in general. But mixed children, these kinds of connections from rape, two sort of long terme liaisons, however you want to call them, were a part of slave societies. And they have been in every slave society that has ever existed. (

Summary:
There is no record of jefferson ever beating any body, but overseers at monticello and his other plantations did use the whip. He developed the idea that using incentives would be a better way to get people to do things than to whip them. It would destroy their value, in my estimation, to degrade them in their own eyes by the whip. This therefore must not be resorted to but in extremities. have my house to build, my fields to form, and to watch for the happiness of those who labor for mine.

have my house to build, my fields to form, and to watch for the happiness of those who labor for mine.
Speaker 8
Can
Speaker 2
you talk a moment about how jefferson related to the slaves that he owned in terms of the violence that he and his overseers perpetrated on them? Well,
Speaker 1
there is no record of jefferson ever beating any body, but overseers at monticello and his other plantations did use the whip. The whip was a ubiquitous part of control on plantations. But jefferson developed the idea that using incentives would be a better way to get people to do things than to whip them. It
Speaker 5
would destroy their value, in my estimation, to degrade them in their own eyes by the whip. This therefore must not be resorted to but in extremities.
Speaker 1
And while he was thinking about this, he read a number of books about changes in pris the way that people dealt with prisoners in penitentiaries. And the idea was incentives worked better than after the fact punishments. So in the 17 nineties, when he sets up a nail factory run by boys, typically, and older tean agers. He institutes a regime of tives, that they would get extra rations for food, they would get extra clothes. (

Summary:
In the 17 nineties, when he sets up a nail factory run by boys, typically, and older tean agers. He institutes a regime of tives which made him more comfortable in his role as a master. I think it&rsquo;s hard to read your book without at least reading into it the possibility that jefferson had something approaching an intimate relationship with sally hemmings. She was a slave. She could not have given consent.

Speaker 1
And while he was thinking about this, he read a number of books about changes in pris the way that people dealt with prisoners in penitentiaries. And the idea was incentives worked better than after the fact punishments. So in the 17 nineties, when he sets up a nail factory run by boys, typically, and older tean agers. He institutes a regime of tives, that they would get extra rations for food, they would get extra clothes. Sometimes they would get money. They were paid gratuities. So this notion of incentives versus punishment or whipping, was something that became a part of his way of making himself a quot better slaveholder. And that&rsquo;s the thing he tried to foster which made him more comfortable in his role as a master.
Speaker 2
In many ways. I think it&rsquo;s hard to read your book without at least reading into it the possibility that jefferson had, at least in his own mind, something approaching an intimate relationship with sally hemmings, that it was not just master and slave. Of course, a lot of people have criticized you for this. She was a slave. She could not have given consent. How have you come to understand the relationship between jefferson and sally hemmings? You
Speaker 1
know, i go back and forth on this. I don&rsquo;t believe that every relationship between an enslaved woman and a master was exactly the same. I think there were diffe types of connections. And jefferson, to me, shows signs of having been attached to sally hemmings. I have no problem saying that, because there are no stories about him with any other woman when he comes back from france, you know, ever. But her, we don&rsquo;t know about her, because once she gets back here, she is totally under his power. (
