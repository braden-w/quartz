Summary:
The huberman lab podcast is a weekly look at the science behind everyday life. This week we are talking about obscessive compulsive disorder, or o c d. We&rsquo;re also going to talk about obsessive compulsive personality disorder (OCD), which is distinct from OCD.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
Welcome to the huberman lab podcast. Wr we discuss science and science base tools for everyday life. I&rsquo;m andrew huberman, and i&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine. To day we are talking about obscessive compulsive disorder, or o c d. We are also going to talk about obsessive compulsive personality disorder, which, as you will soon learn, is distinct from obsessive compulsive disorder. In fact, many people that refer to themselves or others as obsessive or compulsive, or having o c d, or o c d about this, or o c d about that, do not have clinically diagnosil o c d. Rather, many people have obsessive compulsive personality disorder. However, there are many people in the world that have actual o c d. And for those people there is a tremendous amount of suffering. In fact, o c d turns out to be number seven on the list of most debilitating illnesses, not just psychiatric illnesses, but of all illnesses, which is remarkable and somewhat frightening. The good news is, thanks to the fields of psychiatry, psychology and science in general, there are now excellent treatments for o c d. (

Summary:
O c d has mainly to do with obsessions that are intrusive and recurrent. People often invite or like the particular terns of thought that lead them to be compulsive along certain dimensions. It is possible to have recurrent and intrusive obsessions and not engage in the sorts of behaviours that would ever allow people to notice that somebody has o c d. That contour, or that pattern of behaviors. And thoughts interacting. Is very different than obsessive compulsive personality disorder which involves a sense of delayed gratification.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
So unlike an itch that you feel and then you scratch it, feels better, o c d is more like an itch that you feel, you scratch it, and the itch intensifies. That contour, or that pattern of behaviors. And thoughts interacting. Is very different than obsessive compulsive personality disorder, which mainly involves a sense of delayed gratification that people want and somewhat en oy because it allows them to function better or more in line with how they would like to show up in the world. So again, o c d has mainly to do with obsessions that are intrusive and recurrent. Whereas obsessive compulsive personality disorder does not have that intrusive feature to it. People do not mind, or in fact, often invite or like the particular terns of thought that lead them to be compulsive along certain dimensions. So leaving aside obsessive compulsive personality disorder for the moment, let&rsquo;s focus a bit more on o c d and define how it tends to show up in the world. First of all, o c d is extremely common. In fact, current estimates are that anywhere from two point five % to as high as three or even four % of people suffer from true o c d. That is an astonishingly high number. Now the reason the range is so big, two point five % all the way up to three or maybe even four %, is that a lot of the features of o c d go unnoticed, both in the clinitions office and simply because people don&rsquo;t report it and don&rsquo;t talk about it. In fact, it is possible to have recurrent and intrusive obsessions and not engage in the sorts of behaviours that would ever allow people to notice that somebody has o c d. (

Summary:
The idea here is that the obsessions and compulsions are bound by anxiety. By going right, it doesn&rsquo;t create a situation in thebr n and psychology of the person that, ah, you know what, i&rsquo;m not anxious any more. yet it feels as if it would. In fact, in some cases, it feel as if they went left, they would have a full blown panic attack. He goigto go back to that example a little bit later when we talk about one particular category of therapies that are very active in many people for o c d.

Speaker 1
And yet it feels as if it would. In fact, in some cases, it feels as if they went left, they would have a full blown panic attack. So the idea here is that the obsessions and compulsions are bound by anxiety. But then by taking a right hand turn, again, in this one particular example, by taking a right hand turn, there is a very brief, i should mention, very brief, relief of that anxiety at the time of the decision to right, not left. And there&rsquo;s an additional drop in anxiety while one takes the right hand turn, as opposed to the left hand turn. And then, as i alluded to before, there&rsquo;s a reinforcement of the compulsion. In other words, by going right, it doesn&rsquo;t create a situation in thebr n and psychology of the person that, ah, you know what, i&rsquo;m not anxious any more. Left would have probably been ok. It reinforces the idea that right made me feel better, or turning right made me feel better, and going left would have been that much worse. Again, it reinforces the obsession even further. And again, we could swap out right turns and left turns with something like hand washing. The feeling that something is contaminated and the need to wash one&rsquo;s hands, even though one already wash their hands 20, 30, 50 times prior nd were ae. He goigto go back to that example a little bit later when we talk about one particular category of therapies that are very active in many people for o c d, which are the cognive behavior and exposure therapies.

Summary:
Up to 70% of people with o c d have some sort of anxiety, or elevated anxiety. It&rsquo;s either directly related to the o c d or indirectly related to it. cogniv behavior and exposure therapies are very much different than those used for other disorders.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
I think some of you have heard of cogniv behavior and exposure therapies, but the way they are used to treat o c d is very much different than the way they are used to treat other sorts of anxiety disorders and other sorts of disorders generally. So it&rsquo;s fair to say that up to 70 % of people with o c d have some sort of anxiety, or elevated anxiety, either directly related to the o c d or indirectly related to the o c d. And it&rsquo;s really hard to tease those apart, because o c d can create its own anxiety, as i mentioned before. It can even increase its own anxiety. And there&rsquo;s also an issue of depression.

Summary:
Clinics often try to get people to tolerate, not relieve, their anxiety. Todo is to short circuit that neural circuit with the relief of anxiety brought on by engaging in the compulsion related to the obsession. By forcing them down the path of inquiry, that leads them to the place where they very clear ly identify the fear, the anxiety, it raises the anxiety in them.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
I wish i could tell you that&rsquo;s the case, but it turns out it&rsquo;s the opposite. What the clinitian is actually trying to do is get people to feel more anxiety, not less. What they&rsquo;re trying to get them. Todo is to short circuit, no pun intended to intervene in their own neural circuit, i should say, with that relief of anxiety, however brief, brought on by engaging in the compulsion related to the obsession. So whereas typically some one would feel the obsession with, i don&rsquo;t want to turn left ecause something bad i&rsquo;s going o happen, someone&rsquo;s going to die, and then they turn right, they never get the option or the opportunity to really explore what would happen were they to turn left, or to not be able to turn right. By forcing them down the path of inquiry, that leads them to the place where they very clear ly identify the fear, the anxiety, it raises the anxiety in them. And that&rsquo;s actually what the clinition is. After cogni behavior therapy and exposure therapy, in the context of o c d, most often involves trying to get people to tolerate, not relieve, their anxiety. This is extremely important, and i realize there&rsquo;s variation to this depending on the style of cogni behavior therapy, the style of exposure therapy, but almost across the board, the goal, again, is to get people to feel the anxiety that normally they are able to at least partially relieve, however briefly, by engaging in the compulsion. So if we think back to that circuit of cortico strital phylamic, what&rsquo;s going on here? (

Summary:
In anxiety treatment, the goal would be to teach people to dampen their anxiety through breathing techniques. Here it&rsquo;s the opposite. What they&rsquo;re trying to get the patient to do is to really feel the anxiety at its maximum and then do the exact opposite of whatever the normal compulsion is. Now i want to be very clear, this is not the sort of thing you want to do on your own. This is done by trained, licensed psychologists and psychiatrists. But none the less, it really points to the fact that, as a anxiety related disorder, oset is distinct from other types of anxiety.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
Now in the context of anxiety treatment, or other types of treatment, the goal would be to teach people to dampen, to lessen, their anxiety through breathing techniques, or through visualization techniques, or through self talk, or through social support, any of the number of things that are well known to help people self regulate their own anxiety. Here it&rsquo;s the opposite. What they&rsquo;re trying to get the patient to do is to really feel the anxiety at its maximum, but then do the exact opposite of whatever the normal compulsion is. So if normally the compulsion is to wash one&rsquo;s hands, then the idea is to suppressed hand washing while being in the experience of the utmost anxiety. Or in the case of not turning left, the person is expected to, or would hopefully be able, to actually turn left. And as you can imagine, that would evoke tremendous anx ety. And yet to tolerate that anxiety. Now i want to be very clear, this is not the sort of thing you want to do on your own. This is not the sort of thing you want to do for a friend. This is done by trained, licensed psychologists and psychiatrists. But none the less, it really points to the fact that, as a anxiety related disorder, oset is distinct from other types of anxiety. And anxiety related disorders, things like p t s d and panic disorder, et cetera. Because the goal, again, is to bring the person right up close to the thing that they fear the most, and then to interrupt the circuit. (

Summary:
Next i&rsquo;d like to talk about some of the research on and the rolls of hormons in o c d, because it turns out to be a very interesting relationship there. They did not see an exasterbation or a worseing of the symptoms of osede with cannabas, at least that&rsquo;s not my read of the data. But they didn&rsquo;t see an improvement inoced symptoms with canabas or c bed. And to me, that&rsquo;s not surprising, given that cannabas,. cbed seems to in rease focus. if anything, it would increase focus on the obsession and the compulsions.

d. Because, if anything, it would increase focus on the obsession and the compulsions. Now, that&rsquo;s not what they observe. They did not see an exasterbation or a worseing of the symptoms of osede with cannabas, at least that&rsquo;s not my read of the data. But they did not see an improvement inoced symptoms with canabas or c bed. And to me, that&rsquo;s not surprising, given that cannabas, cbed seems to in rease focus. Next i&rsquo;d like to talk about some of the research on and the rolls of hormons in o c d, because it turns out to be a very interesting relationship there. But before i do, i want to point out something that i realize i probably should have said earlier, which is one of the key things for someone with o c d to come to understand if they are to experience any relief of their symptoms, whether notheir doing drug treatments or behavior treatments or otherwise, is that thoughts are not as bad as actions, right? Thoughts are not as bad as actions. One of the rules that people with o c d seem to adopt for themselves is that thoughts are really truly the equivalent of actions. So they&rsquo;ll have an intrusive thought. And we haven&rsquo;t spent too much time on this to day, but earlier i touched on the fact that some of the intrusive thoughts that people have in o c d are really disturbing.

Summary:
One of the rules that people with o c d seem to adopt for themselves is that thoughts are really truly the equivalent of actions. And we haven&rsquo;t spent too much time on this to day, but earlier i touched on the fact that some of the intrusive thoughts that people have in o c d are really disturbing. They can be really gross, or at least gross to that person. Can imagery that is, you know, toxic or infectious, or is highly sexualized in a way that is disturbing to them. This has to do with the fact that your nervous system, as a prediction machine, is oftentimes testing possibilities.

One of the rules that people with o c d seem to adopt for themselves is that thoughts are really truly the equivalent of actions. So they&rsquo;ll have an intrusive thought. And we haven&rsquo;t spent too much time on this to day, but earlier i touched on the fact that some of the intrusive thoughts that people have in o c d are really disturbing. They can be really gross, or at least gross to that person. They can imagery that is, you know, toxic or infectious, or is highly sexualized in a way that is disturbing to them. Can be very taboo. This is not uncommon. When you start talking to people with o c d, and you start pulling on the thread, again, this would be a psychiatrist who was trained to ask the right questions and gain the comfort and trust of a patient, they start to reveal that these these thoughts are really intrusive and kind of disturbing, which is why they feel so compelled to try and suppress them with behaviors. One of the powerful elements of treatment for o c d is to really support the patient and make them realize that thoughts are just thoughts, and that everyone has disturbing thoughts, and that oftentimes those disturbing thoughts arise at the most inconvenient and sometimes what seems like the most inappropriate circumstances. And this relates to a whole larger discussion that we could have about what are thoughts and why do they surface? And how come when you stand at the edge of a bridge, even if you do not want to jump off, you think about jumping off? And this has to do with the fact that your nervous system, as a prediction machine, is oftentimes testing (

Summary:
The big difference between a thought and an action is that the nervous system is, in one case, not translating those patterns of thinking into motor sequences. That nirty way of saying thoughts aren&rsquo;t actions can be helpful for people if they really think about it. They&rsquo;re not thinking and feeling this stuff because they&rsquo;re bad or evil. And of course, sometimes this can cross over with othe other elements of life where we place moral judgment on people for certain behaviours. I think that&rsquo;s part of a healthy society, of course. That&rsquo;s what makes us who we are.

And this has to do with the fact that your nervous system, as a prediction machine, is oftentimes testing possibilities. And sometimes that testing goes way off into the a netherlands of the thought patterns and emotional patterns that we all have inside of us. The big difference between a thought and an action is that, of course, the nervous system is, in one case, not translating those patterns of thinking into motor sequences. That nirty way of saying thoughts aren&rsquo;t actions, blieve it or not, can be helpful for people, if they really think about that and use it as an opportunity to realize that, first of all, they&rsquo;re not crazy. They&rsquo;re not thinking and feeling this stuff because they&rsquo;re bad or evil. And of course, sometimes this can cross over with othe other elements of life where we place moral judgment on people for certain behaviours. I think that&rsquo;s part of a healthy society, of (

Summary:
The national institutes of health in the united states has now devoted an entire division, an entire institute, purely for the exploration of things like breathing practices. Doctor blair simpson&rsquo;s lab has at least one study exploring the role of mindfulness, meditation for the treatment of o c d. I think no possible, useful treatment should be overlooked or unresearched, in my opinion,. provided that can be done safely.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
I realize that a number of listeners of this podcast are probably interested in the non typical or holistic treatments for o c d. Doctor blair simpson&rsquo;s lab has at least one study exploring the role of mindfulness, meditation for the treatment of o c d. Thereare, the data are a little bit u complicated, and i should mention that good things are happening, at least in the united states, probably elsewhere as well. But good things are happening in terms of the exploration of things like meditation and other, let&rsquo;s call them, non traditional or holistic forms of treatment for psychi atric disorders, because of the division of complementary health that&rsquo;s now been launched by the national institutes of health. So whereas before people would think about a meditation, or yoganidra, or even cbd supplementation for that matter, as kind of fringe, maybe, or kind of woo, or a non traditional the very least, the national institutes of health in the united states has now devoted an entire division, an entire institute, purely for the exploration of things like breathing practices, meditation, et cetera. So there&rsquo;s a cancer institute, there&rsquo;s a hearing and deafness institute. There&rsquo;s a vision institute. And now there&rsquo;s this complementary health tute, which i think is a wonderful addition to the more traditional aspects of medicine. I think no possible, useful treatment should be overlooked or unresearched, in my opinion, provided that can be done safely. (

Summary:
Inosital is known to be pretty effective in reducing anxiety, but when taken at very high dosages. Can it do the same at low dosages? We don&rsquo;t know. The sleep i&rsquo;ve been getting on in osital is extremely deep a and does seem to lead to enhanced levels of focus and alertness during the day.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
And again, transiently, in it disappears over time. So nosital has been explored in a bunch of different contexts, including for ticks, ino c d, et cetera. A going back to inosital and its current use, or i should say, my current use, i&rsquo;ve been taking 900 milligrams of anosital as an addition to my existing tool kit for sleep, which ive talked about many times on this podcast and other podcast. Consists of magnesium three and eight, apigenin and theonine. If you want to know more about that kit, you can go to our news letter, nerell network news letter, huberman lab dot com. The tool kit for sleep is there you don&rsquo;t even have to sign up for the news letter, but it&rsquo;ll give you a flavor of the sorts of things that are in the news letter. In any case, i&rsquo;ve been a experimenting a bit a with taking 900 milligrams of myo inosital, either alone or combination with that sleep kid. And i must say, the sleep i&rsquo;ve been getting on in osital is extremely deep a and does seem to lead to enhanced levels of focus and alertness during the day. And perhaps you&rsquo;re noticing that cause i&rsquo;m talking more quickly on this podcast than os potcats. Know, i&rsquo;m just kidding. I don&rsquo;t think the two things re lad in any cond of causal way. The point here is that inosital is known to be pretty effective in reducing anxiety, but when taken at very high dosages. Can it do the same at low dosages? We don&rsquo;t know. I would consider 900 milligrams a low dose most of the given the fact that most of the studies of anocital have explored very high dosages, like even ten or 12 grams per day, which i must say, seems exceedingly high.

Summary:
The word trama is thrown around left and right nowadays, i was tramatized by this or that. For something to reach the level of trama, it really needs to change our neural cirquitry and therefore our thoughts and our behaviours in a persistent way that mal adaptive for us. Not every bad event is tramatizing. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive is one thing. But as doctor conty so appropriately pointed out, trama is really something that changes our neural circuitry and Therefore our thoughts andOur behavior in a very persistent way that is detrimental to us.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
Or some one will say, i was tromatized by that, or was tromatized by this. We should be very careful. I&rsquo;m certainly not the word police, but we should be very careful in the use of certain types of language, especially language that has real psychiatric and psychological definitions, because it can really draw us off course in providing relief for some of these indrums. For instance, the word trama is thrown around left and right nowadays, i was tramatized by this or that. Cause tramer, you&rsquo;re giving me trama. Listen, i realize that many people are tramatized by certain events, including things that are said to them. I absolutely acknowledge that. Hence are episodes on trama and trama treatment, several of them, in fact, doctor conty, doctor a david spegl and then dedicated solo episodes with just me blabbing about trama and trama treatment. But as doctor conty so appropriately pointed out, trama is really something that changes our neural circuitry and therefore our thoughts and our behavior in a very persistent way that is detrimental to us. Not every bad event is tramatizing. Not everything that we dislike, or even that we hate, or that feels terrible to us, is tramatizing. For something to reach the level of trama, it really needs to change our neural cirquitry and therefore our thoughts and our behaviours in a persistent way that mal adaptive for us. Similarly, just calling someone obsessive is one thing. (

Summary:
Obsessive compulsive and obscessive compulsive personality disorder subjects both showed impairments in their psychosocial functioning and quality of life. They are both impairing disorders that are marked by compulsive behaviours. Both sets of subjects are challenged in life because they are having relationship issues or job related issues, et cetera,. However, the individuals with OCD discounted the value of delayed gratifications significantly less than those with obsessive compulsive disorder.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
While first of all, obsessive compulsive and obscessive compulsive personality disorder subjects both showed impairments in their psychosocial functioning and quality of life. They had compulsive behavior. So these are people that are suffering in their life because their compulsions are really strong. So it&rsquo;s not just being really knit picky or really orderly in one case, and having full blown oced in the other. Both sets of subjects are challenged in life because they are having relationship issues or job related issues, et cetera, because they are that compulsive. However, the individuals with obsessive compulsive personality disorder, they discounted the value of delayed gratifications significantly less than those with obsessive compulsive disorder. What do i mean? They are both impairing disorders that are marked by compulsive behaviours. Here iam paraphrasing, but they can be differentiated by the presence of obsessions in o c d. So obsessions in o cd, people with o c d are absolutely fixated on certain ideas, and those ideas are intrusive. Again, that&rsquo;s the hall mark theme. And by an excessive capacity to delay reward in obsessive compulsive personality disorder. That is, people who have excessive compulsive personality disorder are really good at delaying gratification. So they are able to concentrate very intensely and perform very intensely in ways that allow them to instil order such that they can delay rewards. Now you can see why this contour of (

Summary:
i think it is fair to say that obcessive compulsive disorder, whether not in mild, moderate or severe form, is impairing normal functioning. If you are somebody and you have family members that really place enormous value on having a beautiful and highly organized home, well then it could lend itself well to that. It&rsquo;s going to be a matter of degrees of course, none of these things is an absolute. But i do want to touch on something that i think a lot of people experience, and that&rsquo;s superstitions.

If you are somebody and you have family members that really place enormous value on having a beautiful and highly organized home, well then it could lend itself well to that. It&rsquo;s going to be a matter of degrees of course, none of these things is an absolute. It&rsquo;s going to be on a continuum. But i think it is fair to say that obcessive compulsive disorder, whether not in mild, moderate or severe form, is impairing normal functioning. Whereas opsessive compulsive personality disorder, there is a range of expressions of that, some of which can be adaptive, some of which can be maladaptive. And again, it&rsquo;s all going to depend on context. Before we conclude, i do want to touch on something that i think a lot of people experience, and that&rsquo;s superstitions. Superstitions are fascinating. And there&rsquo;s some fascinating research on superstitions. One particular study that i&rsquo;m a big fan of is the work of benslevski at harvard. He studies motor sequences and motor learning. And he as beautiful data on how people learn, for instance, a tennis swing, and the patterns that they engage in early on, and then the patterns of swinging that they swing in the racket, that is, that they engage in later as they acquire more skill. And basically the take away is that the amount of error, or variation from swing to swing is dramatically reduced as they acquire skill. That&rsquo;s all fine and good, and there&rsquo;s some beautiful, a mechanistic data that he and others have discovered to support how that comes to be. But they also explore animal models, in particular, rats pressing sequences of buttons and levers to obtain a reward. (

Summary:
If you watch closely, oftentimes there are components in the motor sequence which are completely unrelated to the pitch. Similarly, rats that have been trained to hit two vers and step on a pedal with their left hind foot will do that to gain a piece of food. In other words, you could eliminate certain components of the motor sequence and it would not matter. The rat would still get the pellet, the pitcher would still be able to pitch. And yet that persist.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
And yet that persist. If you&rsquo;ve ever watched a game of baseball, you&rsquo;ve seen this before. Oftentimes the pitcher up on the mound will bring the ball to their chin, they&rsquo;ll look over their shoulder, they&rsquo;ll look back over the other shoulder, and then they will, of course, reel back and pitch the ball. But if you watch closely, oftentimes there are components in the motor sequence which are completely unrelated to the pitch. They are not looking necessarily to see if someone stealing a base. They&rsquo;re not necessarily looking down at home plate where the batter is. They&rsquo;re doing things like touching the back of their ear before they bring the ball to their chin, or adjusting their hat. And if you watch individual pitchers, what you&rsquo;ll find is that they&rsquo;ll do the same sequence of completely irrelevant motor patterns before each and every single pitch. Similarly, rats that have been trained to, for instance, hit two vers and step on a pedal with their left hind foot and then tap a button up above that is the red button, will do that to gain a piece of food. But sometimes they&rsquo;ll also introduce a pattern into that motor sequence where they will shake their tail a little bit, or they&rsquo;ll turn their head a little bitt, or they&rsquo;ll move their ears bit, et cetera, motor patterns that have nothing to do with obtaining the particular outcome in mind. In other words, you could eliminate certain components of the motor sequence and it would not matter. The rat would still get the pellet, the pitcher would still be able to pitch. (

Similarly, rats that have been trained to hit two vers and step on a pedal with their left hind foot will do that to gain a piece of food. And yet, because they were performed again and again prior to successful trials, the rat, or the human baseball pitcher, comes to believe in some way that it was involved in generating the outcome. Hence, superstition, right? I confess i have a few superstitions. I occasionally will knock on wood. Some gets normalize some of this.

Don&rsquo;t knock on wood. Andrew, don&rsquo;t do that. You don&rsquo;t know. And i don&rsquo;t think anyone wants to be superstitious. I certainly don&rsquo;t. And so every oncein a while i&rsquo;ll just challenge it, and i won&rsquo;t actually knock on wood. I&rsquo;m admitting this to you to kind of am gets normalize some of this. (

Summary:
Superstitions can become full blown compulsions and obsessions when we repeat them often enough that they become automatic. Superstitions are beliefs that we, on an individual scale, come to believe are linked to the probability of an outcome. In fact, we know in our rational minds, they have no real relationship to the outcome.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
They really come to believe that if they don&rsquo;t knock on wood, that something terrible is going to happen, maybe something in particular. Or in the case of the baseball pitcher, they come to believe that if they don&rsquo;t touch their right ear before they reel back on the pitch, that the pitch won&rsquo;t be any good, or that they&rsquo;re going to lose the game. I don&rsquo;t know what their thought process is. Now i also don&rsquo;t know what the rat is thinking, but the rat is clearly doing something, or thinking something, is related to the final outcome. I don&rsquo;t know of any studies where they&rsquo;ve intervened with the particular superstition, like behaviors of the rat, to see whether or not the rat somehow doesn&rsquo;t continue to do the motor sequence to get the pellet. We don&rsquo;t know ther rats. I don&rsquo;t speak rat. Most people don&rsquo;t. Or if you speak to a rat, if it speaks, is not in english. Wy, the point is that superstitions are beliefs that we, on an individual scale, come to believe are linked to the probability of an outcome, when in fact, we know, we actually know in our rational minds, they have no real relationship to the outcome. Superstitions can become full blown compulsions and obsessions when we repeat them often enough that they become automatic. And i think this is what we observe most of the time when we see a pitcher touching their ear. Or, for instance, in tennis, you see the al see someone the they&rsquo;ll slap their shoes. Often i see this, they&rsquo;ly slap the undersides of their souls. (
