Transcript:
Speaker 1
Douglas&rsquo;s trip to ireland is something people are looking at more and more now, because there are so many perceived parallels between the position of the native irish, and other oppressed or excluded elements in different cultures, such as the native americans and, of course, black people in the antibellum and indeed, post bellum states of america. I think myself that historical parallels and like historical precedents, can be used as rather a blunt instrument. Certainly, there was a feeling among radical politicians, nationalist politicians in ireland and black politicians in the united states that they had a certain common cause. There is also the overwhelming fact, and this, i think, is very relevant to douglas, that the great leader of catholic ireland, who brought about the so called emancipation of catholics when they were finally allowed to sit in parliament in 18 29. This great leader, daniel connell, was a very passionate anti slaver and abolitionist. And many of the people in his catholic movement, and then his movement to repeal the union with britain and ireland, felt the same way. He was a great radical in the cosmic sense of radical politics. Daniel o&rsquo;connell, as well as being founder of catholic freedoms and an avataur of national autonomy,
Speaker 2
what do you think douglas learned in ireland? I
Speaker 1
suspect that douglas, who was a subtle and clever politician, learned that the parallels between what seemed to be the oppression of the native irish and the very real oppression of blacks in the united states were not exactly commensurate to each other. The extent to which he absolutely noted that isn&rsquo;t proven, but i feel that, and here iam chancing my arm, rather that any one as analytical as he would have seen that what irish natives suffered under in mid nineteenth century ireland was nothing like what black slaves suffered under in mid nineteenth century america.

Summary:
Modern irish fiction is often a barometer of how a country thinks about itself. Do you think it fair to say that ireland is not a country of utopian theorists? That requires a bit of thought about no. What seems to have happened since the 19 seventies, when the whole focus of irish literary achievements shifted from the short story to the novel. This is, i think, true of many lesser known writers as well.

Do you
Speaker 2
think it fair to say that ireland is not a country of utopian theorists? That
Speaker 1
requires a bit of thought about no. I think if you look at modern irish fiction, which is very often a barometer of how a country thinks about itself, in the early decades of irish independence, let&rsquo;s say, of the twenties and thirties, you had the short stories of shone filon, mary laven, frank o&rsquo;connor. And you had a kind of, not utopian, but often rather idealized o often quite a bitter view of irish, especially rural life as well. But certainly a sense of specialness and removed ness and a celebration of a certain kind of irish identity. This is, i think, true of many lesser known writers as well. What seems to me to have happened since the 19 seventies, when the whole focus of irish literary achievements shifted from the short story to the novel. (

Summary:
From the seventeenth century on, what ireland was is something that is up for grabs. We&rsquo;re trying to re invision it and explain it in a new way. The best history is written when we realize that people acted in terms of an imagined future which didn&rsquo;t happen. As we all act in terms of itis never going to happen,. That imagined future dictates the way in which we we behave.

John

stuart mill once wrote this in a letter, i know tolerably well what ireland was, but have a very impere idea of what ireland is. Is that still true? Was it ever true? It&rsquo;s
Speaker 1
true of many people. It&rsquo;s interesting, you quote mill, who wrote a wonderful essic aled england and ireland, which reflects, i think, that opinion. He also said something which i&rsquo;ve often quoted, which i like very much, which is that ireland is in the main stream of european history, whereas england is in an eccentric tributary. And i think that&rsquo;s very true. And a lot of what we&rsquo;ve been say to day, tyler seems to me, to bear that out. From the seventeenth century on, what ireland was, i think, is something that is also, in a sense, up for grabs, where we&rsquo;re trying to re invision it. Were trying to revise it. We&rsquo;re trying to re explain it. Something i wrote long ago, which has been quoted once or twice, is that the best history is written when we realize that people acted in terms in belief of, in expectation, of a future that was never going to happen. And i think that&rsquo;s very true. Its true of the histories of most countries, but very true of the history of ireland. The expectations in which the revolutionaries acted in 19 19 21 were of a future that didn&rsquo;t happen. The expectations of unionists and imperialists in ireland, of which there were many, in the late nineteenth century, they acted in terms of a future that was never going to happen either. As we all act in terms of itis never going to happen. But that imagined future is what dictates the way in which we we behave. I think, in a sense, john stuart mills&rsquo;s very honest admission is relevant to that as well. (

Speaker 2
you probably know. Oscar wilde once wrote to william yates, we are a nation of brilliant failures, but we are the greatest talkers since the greeks. With so much irish success to day, how will that image have to change? Is ire and culturally prepared to be one of the countries at&rsquo;s doing better than all the other countries? Well,
Speaker 1
again, if i can instance my own work, i wrote a book called luck and to the irish, a brief history of change, 19 70 to two thousand which is a study of how ireland became rich, successful, a country into which people emigrated rather than exporting its own people for emigration. A country which was producing a large quantity of the world&rsquo;s supply of viagara, to take one example of its pharmaceutical revolution. A country in which not only big farmer, but also silicon technology invaded from the 19 nineties and made a number of people very, very rich. (

Summary:
i think emigration has created among the irish a kind of global sense which opens the mind to such things. I think there is a far lesser degree of resentment and expressed bigotry against incoming people from different cultures in ireland. Those people themselves become, rather quickly, what is called the new irish as northern ireland becomes at least as much catholic as protestant. To say that it would increase them is to perhaps assume too much. Tha people&rsquo;s political vote follows their no religious identity. i think you guet far more middle class catholics who will admit to believing in the union now than you ever would have before.

Speaker 2
You
Speaker 1
know, i think it is. Tyler, i don&rsquo;t want to sound too chauvinistic about this, but it surprises me, there is, of course, racism in ireland, as there is racism everywhere. But it surprises me, givin the and you&rsquo;ve just drawn attention to it yourself, the extent of imigration into ireland, it surprises me how comparatively easily that has been absorbed, and how little there is of populac store puters or nativist movements against the incomer. Partly because i think emigration has created among the irish a kind of global sense which opens the mind to such things. And there is also such a thing as reverse emigration. A great many people from the boom years on, you wouldn&rsquo;t say re emigrated, returned, i suppose, t the simple way of putting it to ireland, having emigrated earlier and returned, bringing with them, i suspect, an outward looking and tolerant view, which perhaps they wouldn&rsquo;t have if they had lived all ther time in ireland. I think, given what you see in other countries, and you&rsquo;re absolutely right, it&rsquo;s, i think, unusual for it to be so, but i think there is a far lesser degree of resentment and expressed bigotry against incoming people from different cultures in and partly because those people themselves become, rather quickly, what is called the new irish, as
Speaker 2
northern ireland becomes at least as much catholic as protestant. Does that increase or decrease the chances for a single ireland? To
Speaker 1
say that it would increase them is to perhaps assume too much. Tha people&rsquo;s political vote follows their no religious identity. It used to be so, it&rsquo;s less so now, i think you guet far more middle class catholics who will admit to believing in the union now than you ever would have before. You guet on the other side, i think, more especially in the younger aged cohorts, you get far more people from a protestant background prepared to envisage a united ireland, partly, of course, beca the republic with which they would theoretically be uniting is such a younger, (

Summary:
Derry, or some wot prefer to say london derry, has often been seen as as much the republic as northern ireland. Derry would perhaps assimilate with a reunited ireland rather easily than many places. One of my favorite irish novelists, elizabeth bowen, said that she wished the english remembered much more irish history and the irish forgot moreof it. And i tend to feel ame way. If you teach irish history to irish people, you can expect a certain parti pre a certain attitude that is already there,. I should say, one of the great things about being an irish historian is the sophisticated, engaged, passionate
Transcript:
Speaker 1
One hopes,
Speaker 2
does derry, or some wot prefer to say london derry, have an economic future? Or is it just stuck out there, and it&rsquo;s going to get smaller and people will leave it? I&rsquo;m
Speaker 1
not qualified to say. I mean, london derry stroke city, as some people refer to it, because londons, derry stroke has its own valuable traditions, and, again, own cultural traditions. But its hinterland, culturally, has often been seen as as much the republic as northern ireland. Derry london. Derry would perhaps assimilate with a reunited ireland rather easily than many places, cause, in a sense, culturally, so much of it has looked south anyway. But that&rsquo;s, again, a semi educated guess.
