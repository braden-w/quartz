Summary:
Worship is it has this salebratory aspect, and that is tied in to this instinct to imitate. And so partly, what&rsquo;s happening in a church ceremony, for example, is that an object of lbratory worship is specified. In the christian tradition, that&rsquo;s christ - which is a very strange thing, because he meat a absolutely abysmal end. But you realize that in order to exist in the world, you are constantly having to sacrifice,. That you have to sacrifice the idiosyncrasies in order to be able to grasp the the object.

celebration. Cause you might say, well, you know, what does it mean to worship? And a cynical person would say, it means to believe things that one but a damnd fool would believe, you know. And that&rsquo;s kind of a dismissive modern attitude. But that isn&rsquo;t what it means. Like worship is it has this salebratory aspect, and that is tied in to this instinct to imitate. So if you have a sports hero, first of all, he&rsquo;s a hero, and he is someone you put on a pede, which indicates a kind of an elevation towards the divine, or towards the sky, metaphorically speaking. And then there is this compulsion to imitate. And that&rsquo;s no different than celebration. And so partly, what&rsquo;s happening in a church ceremony, for example, is that an object of lbratory worship is specified. And in the christian tradition, that&rsquo;s christ. And which is a very strange thing, because, of course, he meat a absolutely abysmal end. And that&rsquo;s an unbelievably complicated idea too, that that
Speaker 2
the
Speaker 1
the tragic, the ultimately tragic, element of human life is to be voluntarily apprehended in the deepest possible sense. And that what that produces, paradoxically, is a celebration and then also a vision of the resurrection. And that&rsquo;s an idea that&rsquo;s so deep you you can lose yourself in that. Well, we&rsquo;ve lust ourself in it for two and years. Because one of the things that this attention problem brings about is the question of sacrifice to and
Speaker 2
you see it in the in religious ceremonies. But you realize that in order to exist in the world, you are constantly having to sacrifice, that you have to sacrifice the idiosyncrasies in order to be able to grasp the the object. Cause this can be all kinds of things, rikei o be a dog&rsquo;s toto, cnd, be cand be a million things. But in order to be able to grasp it, i have to sacrifice h idiosyncrasies. And i also have to somehow, let say, recognize it in its highest form, or kind of move it towards its highest form. And that seems to be an aspect of religious thinking, is acty part of attention, which
Speaker 1
i et well, thi sacrificial aspect of attention, in part, is that whenever you see something as that thing, you sacrifice the possibility of all the other things it could be. And that&rsquo;s delimiting to a large degree. You know, it hems you in, but, but that&rsquo;s also lief, because, you know, how many bloody million things do you want to attend to at one time? But so part of the reason, you know, the idea of sacrifice, the conscious idea of sacrifice, emerges very easy early on. (

Summary:
The structure of sacred architecture, say, duplicates the structure of cognitive category and also the structure of perceptual category. So we inhabit a temple, corrupt though it may be, with every interaction with the world that we undertake. It&rsquo;s like te it&rsquo;s the precondition for the idea of reality itself, which i that&rsquo;s really real, right? I mean, you&rsquo;ve got real that&rsquo;s nothing. That is not a scientific presupposition. The christian idea of the logos, and the greek idea as well, is the expression of the recognition of the preconditions for the real itself. And that&rsquo;s really something to understand as well.

Speaker 1
And so it&rsquo;s strange that the structure of sacred architecture, say, duplicates the structure of cognitive category and also the structure of perceptual category. So we inhabit a temple, corrupt though it may be, with every interaction with the world that we undertake. And that&rsquo;s really quite a frightening thing to lize, very it&rsquo;s a very frightening thing to realize. When you really realize it, it&rsquo;s like, oh, ohoh, this is real. And it&rsquo;s even worse than that. It&rsquo;s like te it&rsquo;s the precondition for the idea of reality itself, which i that&rsquo;s really real, right? I mean, you&rsquo;ve got real that&rsquo;s nothing. It&rsquo;s the precondition for reality itself that&rsquo;s superreal. And, you know, to some degree, the christian idea of the logos, and the greek idea as well, is the expression of the recognition of the precondition for the real itself. And that&rsquo;s really something to understand as well. You know, scientists, i talked to richard dawkins when i was at oxford, you know, and one of the things that characterizes dawkins is that dawkins believes that the truth will set you free. That is not a scientific presupposition. That is a religious presupposition, but it also might be the religious presupposition without which science is not possible. Because all the scientists i know whoare real scientists, they&rsquo;re unthey abide by the truth to an unbelievable degree. You know, if you&rsquo;re a social scientist and you have a data set in front of you, you know, say, 200 columns of 500 rows, you know, a complex data set, an there are a lot of ways you can get that to talk to you statistically. And you make thousands of decisions when you&rsquo;re doing a statistical analysis. And every single one of those is an ethical decision. And one of the decisions is, whell do i priotize my career, or do i priortize my pursuit of the truth? And often those are antagonistic, because if you have a big daticet, you want to discover something in it, and maybe there&rsquo;s nothing there, and then you&rsquo;ve wasted two years, and that&rsquo;s pretty hard on your career.

Summary:
Small male can become alpha, especially if he has the support of a influential female. The brute chimps do rule now and then, but they get torn to shreds by their enemies. &ldquo;The psychopath chimp types who use power to attain dominance, have very short rules and end in a very bloody way&rdquo;
Transcript:
Speaker 1
But people think, well, that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s how you look at the world if you&rsquo;re sensible. It&rsquo;s like while franz de wall&rsquo;s been studying chimps for 30 years, and that&rsquo;s not true. That is not what happens. He told me flat out that frequently, small male can become alpha, especially if he has the support of a influential female. And the small male becomes elphop and has the support of the influential female, not because he expresses arbitrary power, but because he&rsquo;s unbelievably good at mutual reciprocation. And so he has friends, and he does things for his friends, and they do things for him, and they trust each other. And he has lots of friends, which also means he has no enemies, which turns out to be really important. Because the brute chimps, like the cyclopath elphus, they do rule now and then, but they get torn to shreds by their enemies, because, you know, they&rsquo;re tough, let&rsquo;s say, and mean, but they have day and two chimps they stamped a week before, ally together and tear them, literally tear them into shreds. And so the the psychopath chimp types who use power to attain dominance, have very short rules and end in a very bloody way. And de wall has pointed out, like pge did among children, that power is an unstable a ethic upon which to base the social hierarchy, even for chimps. And chimps are male dominated, they have a patriarchal society, and they&rsquo;re relatively brutal, and it doesn&rsquo;t even work for them. It certainly doesn&rsquo;t work for human beings. So whatever is at the apex of the pyramid, it&rsquo;s not, as the bloody marxists insist, you know, the raw expression of powerand and exploitation. Wrong, wrong. Not the case. Doesn&rsquo;t even work in nature. Doesn&rsquo;t work for rats, doesn&rsquo;t work for panzes, certainly doesn&rsquo;t work for people. And then there is a kind of natural ethic that emerges out of that, (

Summary:
Even among animals, mutual reciprocity seems to be a cardinal organizing feature. We all are struck with the problem of determining what we are going to put in the highest place.

It certainly doesn&rsquo;t work for human beings. So whatever is at the apex of the pyramid, it&rsquo;s not, as the bloody marxists insist, you know, the raw expression of powerand and exploitation. Wrong, wrong. Not the case. Doesn&rsquo;t even work in nature. Doesn&rsquo;t work for rats, doesn&rsquo;t work for panzes, certainly doesn&rsquo;t work for people. And then there is a kind of natural ethic that emerges out of that, right? Because with rats and with chimps and other social animals, it varies to some degree from species to species, thereis the necessity for something like mutual reciprocity as the basis for successful social organization. And that some thin like, treat your neighbor like you would want to be treated. It&rsquo;s something like that. It&rsquo;s the behavior equivalent of that. Now, ass earlier, you know, from whence does the highest injunction emerge or e when comes d yet yt. Well, it&rsquo;s strange, right? Some of it&rsquo;s bought em up. It&rsquo;s like, even among animals, mutual reciprocity seems to be a cardinal organizing feature, even done in the spirit of play, interestingly enough, ecause play is a mammalian universal. And that&rsquo;s kind of bot em up. But then at the same time, this, this, i suppose, pertains to the role, of the mysterious role of consciousness in the world. It&rsquo;s like, while we&rsquo;re also aware of this, right? And we also, we also think about it abstractly as a good and we don&rsquo;t only learn it bottom up, we also conceptiualize it top down. And then they meet. And that is, that&rsquo;s moses coming down the mountain with the tablets. And so what did he meet on the mountain? Well, god, whell. He met whatever&rsquo;s at the highest place. And we all are struck with the problem of determining what we are going to put in the highest place. And increasingly, i have been viewing the biblical corpuse as an attempt to cast narrative light on the nat of the spirit that should be at the highest place. So i can giveyou an example of that. So in the earliest stages of genesis, god is so what should be in the highest place? (

Summary:
i do not believe that compassion is an untrammelled moral virtue, i think one of the terrible things about our society is that we&rsquo;ve put compassion in the highest place, unthinkingly. I really mean that technically. So if if imagine that, that your ethic was that you were a hundred % compassionate, ok. So what are you like? Well, you&rsquo;re like a good mother with a child under six months of age. Because human babies are born premature in some fundamental sense. And there&rsquo;s complex reasons for that. One is that there&rsquo;s a arms race, and evolutionary arms race, between the circumference of the infant&rsquo;s head and the dimensions of the pelvic hole through which

ya. Andwe, if
Speaker 2
you look at it historically, you can see that at the first moment when the, letsa, the religious ideal starts to crack, you get some positive things like, you know, science and t enlightenment. But maki desad is right there, waiting to manifest the spirit that dostoyevsky finds in raskolnikov. It&rsquo;s there im in terms of sam, one of the things that i haven&rsquo;t heard you talk about too much, but there&rsquo;s something about what you said with him that that brings it up to me, is that he sees this hierarchy, or this the sa religious structure, has a totalitarian impulse, and it is a kind of structure that comes down and manifests itself. One of the things that comes down from the mountain, let&rsquo;s say, in religious stories, is also compassion. Without the hierarchy, there is, is it possible for there to be compassion? Because compassion is also the manner in which we accept that nothing ever reaches the ideal, that we can recognize it, but we also know that it&rsquo;s always kind of beyond us. And so there is a sense that is judging us. But there is also a sense in which it kind of yields because, you know, everyg is imperfect, and everything, every, every house is imperfect, every building, everything that we notice, we can also see that it doesn&rsquo;t reach that ideal. I don&rsquo;t if you ever thought about that a little bit. Well, let me think about that for se eve. Never talked about compassion before. So,
Speaker 1
yes. Well, when i, when i think about compassion, i mean, first of all, i do not believe that compassion is an untrammelled moral virtue. And i think one of the terrible things about our society, one of the deadly, eatable things about our society, is that we&rsquo;ve put compassion in the highest place, unthinkingly. And compassion is for infants. I really mean that technically. So if if imagine that, that your ethic was that you were a hundred % compassionate, ok. So what are you like? Well, you&rsquo;re like a good mother with a child under six months of age. Because, because human babies are born premature in some fundamental sense. So, you know, the average gestation period for a mammal of about our size should be two years. And so our babies are born radically premature. And there&rsquo;s complex reasons for that. One is that there&rsquo;s a arms race, and evolutionary arms race, between the circumference of the infant&rsquo;s head and the dimensions of the pelvic hole through which the baby has to pass to be born.

You know how bad discriminate is? It&rsquo;s like, well, no, it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s differentiation. It&rsquo;s judgment. It&rsquo;s its putting things in their proper place. It&rsquo;s its setting the highest above the lowest. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s formulating a pathway for further development. And you know, a mother might say, you&rsquo;re just fine the way you are.

So young was a student of nicha. I don&rsquo;t mean he, you know, formerly, but he was very well versed in in thinking, as much, or more so, than in freudian thinking.

But then he also said, th the solution to that will be the superman will have to appear at the uber mench and he will be the man who can create his own values. And so both freud and young were interested in that idea, a freud more peripheraly, but young more more consciously. And part of what young was trying to find out is, whell could we create our own values? And the answer he came up with was, no, that&rsquo;s not possible. And why? So the question is, why? Well, you know, for the psychoanalysts, we were beset by (

Summary:
The world&rsquo;s just too complex for us to generate our values in the span of a single life, out of whole cloth, autonomously. And partly the reason that&rsquo;s impossible is, well, ok, so generate your own values. But then what are you going to do with your wife or your husband or your friend? They&rsquo;re what are they going to they&rsquo;re justn live by your values all of a sudden? Well, it&rsquo;s an instinct. Play integrates base motivations into a higher unity, but it&rsquo;san instinct.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
these values that and temptations and impulses come upon us that we cannot control, they are part of our autonomous nature. And because they have this autonomy, and so that would be the autonomy of emotions and the autonomy of motivations, and then even the autonomy of the spirit that unites motivations, because we don&rsquo;t know for ex in the spirit of play, for example. Play is an instinct. Play integrates base motivations into a higher unity, but it&rsquo;s an instinct. And so young realized very rapidly that it wasn&rsquo;t technically possible for us to create orn values. And that&rsquo;s partly his stumb upon the problem of complexity. S the world&rsquo;s just too complex for us to generate our values in the span of a single life, out of whole cloth, autonomously, no matter how much of a superman we were, ye. And partly the reason that&rsquo;s impossible is, well, ok, so generate your own values. What the hell are you going to do with your wife or your husband or your friend? They&rsquo;re what are they going to they&rsquo;re justn live by your values all of a sudden? (

A week before that, i was down at a franciscan university, and i found it unbelievably soothing, which was very much unlike the reactions i&rsquo;ve had before.

and so ya, you you frenchmen, you know, you&rsquo;ve, you&rsquo;ve abandoned your catholicism. You think the catholics, they were crazy. It&rsquo;s like you ain&rsquo;t seen hin yet. And so i believe. And yung kind of convinced me of that. He he more or less posited. And you could say the same thing about orthodox. He said, catholic is as sane as people ever get. And that&rsquo;s partly because we have to have one foot in the dream and the mystery. We have to, you knowh douglas murray speak recently about this. That was very interesting, as murray is an atheist, essentially, and he has a variety of reasons for that. But he has swung around hard recently. And he said, when he was talking to dave reuben, he said, i don&rsquo;t believe that either conservatism or classic liberalism can sur in the absence of of the religious surround which was really something for him to admit. And it&rsquo;slike takin him like five years of thinking to come to that conclusion. But then he said something even more remarkable, i thought. And he said, and it&rsquo;s actually the mysterious part of it that has to be retained, the virgin birth, the resurrection, the crucifix and all of that crazy mythology, let&rsquo;s say, because otherwise it just degenerates into another form of cheap social justice. And like, don&rsquo;t we have enough of that? And i think that&rsquo;s now, i don&rsquo;t know what to make of that because, well, and that&rsquo;s why we have discussion continually about the, what would you say, while the transcendent, i suppose, the miraculous, the transcendent, the idea of the resurrection, for example, and all of that, it&rsquo;s like, well, what do you do with that? And the answer is, we don&rsquo;t know, but we don&rsquo;t throw it out without o have isome sense of what&rsquo;s going to come in to replace it. And we&rsquo;re seeing that now, you know, look at us. We&rsquo;re so confused. No, bloody in&rsquo;t wonder the russians are at war with us. Is like we&rsquo;re not havinganything to do those people. They simultaneously proclaim that a woman is absolutely necessary for the highest position in the land, or one of them, and that the same person says, why, i don&rsquo;t eve kow what a woman is like. Are those people insane? Like, clearly, clearly, that&rsquo;s just way too far, right? Dick? When i talk to my democrat friends, i say, look, you can have one of those. No, there&rsquo;s either no distinction between man anr a woman, or it&rsquo;s important that a woman&rsquo;s on the supreme court. But there is no bloody way i&rsquo;m giving you both. So cause i don&rsquo;t even know how to do that. I have no idea how to do thatk, what am i supposed to do? Celebrate womanhood and simultaneously celebrate the fact that the differences between men and women are so trivial that theyre relevant and they can be changed at whem? (

Pier poliev appeared on the show to talk about his plans for Canada. He said he would be willing to repair our relationship with the United States, and maybe do something quasi intelligent on the energy front. Poliev also suggested that we should defund the c b c television station in Canada.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
And so so what would i say about pier poliev? Well, he had enough guts to come on my utube channel. And, you know, i didn&rsquo;t give him any questions beforehand. Zero. There was no am we didn&rsquo;t do any post talk editing, and he didn&rsquo;t ask for any. He answered all the questions i asked him with no prevarication. You know, there was a few kind of prepared political talking points and, ah, but i thought he handled himself extremely well. He a very good conversationalist. He could really take turns in a conversation. He was thoughtful. I believe that his care for working class people is genuine. I think his economic policy is unsophisticated to the point of, ah, would you say, danger insufficiency? And i&rsquo;ve talked tof some very sophisticated economic players in the canadian market. And they believe that our basic legal framework and our economic framework is forty years out of date. And these are people who&rsquo;ve played, let&rsquo;s say, on the international market and got burned badly by hiper qualified american legal experts who just tore them into shreds when they tried to compete on broadscale and international markets. We don&rsquo;t have good policies for data ownership in canada. We&rsquo;re way out of sink with the digital age. We have no idea what we should be owning and what we shouldn&rsquo;t be owning in terms of our our personal information or data. And it isn&rsquo;t obvious that polyev has the sophistication to develop those policies, but i think he would and could learn. And he&rsquo;s young. He&rsquo;s only in his early forties. And i think he would be willing to repair our relationship with the united states to and maybe do something quasi intelligent on the energy front, which would be, you know, kind of delightful. And maybe he&rsquo;d defund the c b c. And christ we should vote for him for just for that e, cause
