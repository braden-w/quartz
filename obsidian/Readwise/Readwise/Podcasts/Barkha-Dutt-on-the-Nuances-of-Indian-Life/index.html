Summary:
In your earlier book, you described india as essentially mesogonistic. What do you think is the most deeply rooted, structural account of how that came to be? i&rsquo;m struck by the fact that my nation has a much more progressive set of laws around abortion than the americans might have soon.

Speaker 1
I
Speaker 2
have so many questions about india for you. In your earlier book, this unquiet land, you described india as, and i quote, essentially mesogonistic. What do you think is the most deeply rooted, structural account of how that came to be?
Speaker 1
Yes, thoughas i&rsquo;m answering that, i&rsquo;m struck by the fact that my nation has a much more progressive set of laws around abortion and the right to legal and safe abortion than the americans might have soon. So that&rsquo;s just an illustration of what i mean by complexity. You know, when i studied at columbia, at the journalism school, i had a flat mate, and i think i write about in the same book, who assumed that because i was an indian woman, i would have arranged marriage, i would have no rights, i wouldn&rsquo;t be outspoken. And then when we got to know each other better, i found that the western rituals of the dating scene were often much more patriarchal than anything i&rsquo;d experienced. That&rsquo;s it, of course, i have a sort of grown up and resisted intrenched patriarchy, intrenched miss ajeny. The expectations of what it means to be female at india come out in very sort of insidious everyday way. You know, the big things, right? You know, about where the public spaces are safe or not safe for women.

Summary:
The literacy and education rates, our higher local units of governance have, in fact, performed better. We saw this even in the covert management, across the board in the south. So i think a combination of culture and governance, the fact that there&rsquo;s been more investment on health care, on reproductive rights, all of this has led to,. i will say, the south being a better place for women than the north.
Transcript:
Speaker 2
Would you agree with the common impression that, over all, in india, women have it better in the south than in the north? And if so, what would you fer about underlying structural causes of mesaginy ind india? I
Speaker 1
would agree with that. And the reasons for that are manifold. Some relate to the fact that there are some societies, for example, in the southern state of carala, that are matriarchal, where i the very organization of society and the home itself. And it all keeps coming back to home, you know, settles a lot of your other affiliated freedom. So there is the organization of many of these societies as matriarchal. The literacy and education rates, our higher local units of governance have, in fact, performed better. We saw this even in the covert management, across the board in the south. So i think a combination of culture and governance, the fact that there&rsquo;s been more investment on health care, on reproductive rights, all of this has led to, i will say, the south being a better place for women than the north. And i say, this is a woman who actually lives and has grown up in north india. How
Speaker 2
much of that difference between the north and the south do you think stamps from is, which is, of course, more prevalent in the north? (

Summary:
The innuendo has always been that one day moslems will outnumber hindus. The rate of decline is also now the sharpest, says Ravi Agrawal. He disagrees with legislations proposed in several parts of india to penalize those who have more than two children.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
That&rsquo;s such an interesting question, because one of the most politicized conversations in india is a round population group, and of course, the ssion or the innuendo, has always been that one day moslems will outnumber hindus, because moslems are growing at a galloping pace. Actually, the data tells you, and this is well documented, both within india and in a recent survey that was released by pew, that though the rate of growth is higher among moslems definitely than it is among hindoo communities, the rate of decline is also now the sharpest, because, you know, there was a higher, much higher rate of growth among moslems, and that the moslems will never outnumber hindus. But would i take that to take your question for there being a a sort of lack of enthusiasm for child rearing? Not true. This has been ad is old fight to get india&rsquo;s population under control, and it is finally starting to yield results. Which is why i actually disagree with legislations that are now being proposed in several parts of india to actually either incentivize or penalize those who have more than two children. I think penalties don&rsquo;t necessarily work. Incentives can, but penalties certainly don&rsquo;t. We also have the added issue all female fetacite, which is girls who are killed in their womb because before they are allowed to be brought into this world, because of the premium that is still placed, very much across classes, on a boy child.

Summary:
Tyler: One of biggest reasons for the worsening relations, or the othering, as it were, is the gatalization of how people live. We are seeing a kind of moslem quarter and christian quarter in a way that we wouldn&rsquo;t have before our cities were so getized. It&rsquo;s also true that it is tougher for a person from a religious minority, in particular, an indian moslem, to get a house as easily as a non muslem. And also, the last point is of inter faith marriages, or interfaith love. This is a deeply politicized issue as well.
Transcript:
Speaker 2
Well,
Speaker 1
you just spoke of intermingling, tyler. And i think that one of the biggest reasons for the worsening relations, or the othering, as it were, of communities that are not your own, is the gatalization of how people live. So for example, you know, if there were neighbourhoods where people live cheek by jowl, that still happens, of course, in many cities, but it also happens less than it used to. And that is true. We are seeing a kind of moslem quarter, and, to give an example, or a christian quarter, in a way that we wouldn&rsquo;t have before our cities were so getized. And i think that ind of intermingling, of living in the same housing societies or neighborhoods, participating in each other&rsquo;s festivals, asd the postagus tolerating them. Those are the structural changes or shifts that we are witnessing. It&rsquo;s also true that it is tougher for a person from a religious minority, in particular, an indian moslem, to get a house as easily as a non muslem. And i think i would be lying if i did not acknowledge that. And also, the last point is of inter faith marriages, or interfaith love. This is a deeply politicized issue as well. While i am talking to you, in the last 24 hours, in the southern city of hydrobart, one of our big musard of technology hubs, we&rsquo;ve had reports of a moslem family that attacked a hindu man for marrying a moslem woman. And in reverse, we see moslem women also targeted all the time if they choose to marry hindus. This is not helped by the fact that you&rsquo;ve had several states now talking about what they call love jihad. That&rsquo;s the phrase they use for marriages that are across religious communities. In particular, between hindus and moslems. The percentage of people indians marrying, not just outside their religion, but also outside their caste, which in hindus, is a kind of hierarchical system of traditional occupation that you are born into, is woefully low.

Summary:
The dullets are the people who are at the very bottom of the social hierarchy. They often do menial jobs like cleaning toilets, or handling the dead skin of cattle which then work into leather. After she complained, bavery davy was made to live on the outskirts of her village and not allowed access to the village well. When one of the courts actually acquitted the men she had accused of rape, the judge remarked that men of a higher cast would not touch a woman of a lower cast so this rate could not have taken place. I tell you the story to say that the disavowal of caste is a privilege of sorts. You can&rsquo;t disown the reality of caste
Transcript:
Speaker 2
So
Speaker 1
i&rsquo;ll tell you a little story about myself. When i was 18, i studied in one of inda&rsquo;s top liberelots colleges. And i used to be asked, what is your cost? And i used to say, i don&rsquo;t know. And i was very proud of saying that. And i really did know. My parents had never told me what my cast was, and it was their sort of way of bringing me up to be a progressive indian. And then many decades, not even many decades later, a few years later, i did one of my first journalism stories in the gang rape of a galit woman in a village in rajastan. The dullets are the people who are at the very bottom of the social hierarchy. They are often treated as outcasts. They often do menial jobs like cleaning toilets, or handling the dead skin of cattle, which then work into leather. They also, it&rsquo;s shameful that this practice still exists, manual scavengers, which, in other words, they carry, literally carry the out of toilets that don&rsquo;t have water or clean our sewers. And for these reasons, they&rsquo;re often treated completely at the bottom of the cast hierarchy. And the woman, bavery davy, who had been gang raped, she had been working with a government programme to stop child marriages in her village. And among the men who raped her was the father of a one year old child whom she had been trying to stop from being married. After she complained, she was made to live on the outskirts of her village, not allowed access to the village well. And when one of the courts actually acquitted the men she had accused of rape, the judge remarked, men of a higher cast would not touch a woman of a lower cast, so this rate could not have taken place. I tell you the story to say that the disavowal of caste is a privilege of sorts. I&rsquo;ve had to accept the hard way that you can&rsquo;t disown the reality of caste. Much as i would like to. Has there been mobility out of the intrenched cast (

Summary:
Two decades ago, you say the state does not recognize cast. In fact, the state has special affirmative action for what are called cherun inscidual tribes. The problem is that now we have everybody wanting a slice of this affirmative action," he says. &ldquo;It will not change, in my opinion, till there is economic, professional and social mobility&rdquo;

structures? There has been in the cities, you will see less and less of this kind of discrimination of the kind that i have just described having taken place. It was also two decades ago, you say the state does not recognize cast. In fact, the state has special affirmative action, which i support, for what are called cherun inscidual tribes, which have traditionally been discriminated against for centuries. The problem is, tyler, that now we have everybody wanting a slice of this affirmative action, which allows you quoters in jobs and education, at least in institutes that are run and managed by government. So you have something called the o b cs, the other backward classes, who say, wo know, we&rsquo;re not at the bottom, but we&rsquo;re somewhere in the middle. And from state to state, we&rsquo;ve also suffered either economic or social discrimination. And so you have this highly politicized conversation, you have the entrenched social tradition. Even where professional practices are no longer interlinked with cast, you have just this intrenched social structure. And it will not change, in my opinion, till there is economic, professional and social mobility. And we&rsquo;re seeing some of that, a lot of that. In fact, a lot of things have changed, but not when it comes once again, to love and marriage. And i kind of feel that that&rsquo;s where i think the real tests are. It&rsquo;s like people who say, you know, some of my best friends are black, some of my best friends are moslem, yes, but would you be comfortable with your daughter marrying one? That&rsquo;s where the test is. (

Summary:
If i at the topsy eos outside of india, say in silicon valley, it seems most of them are brahmins. Why that difference? I know that silicon valley has been grappling with questions around a cause discrimination. So there is an overlapping coincidence of social economic backwardess among marginalized groups. That is dullets, that is moslems. Now, i can&rsquo;t say to you that there is a coincidence between cast and technology and success.

I think what i can say to you is that there has been an overlapping coincidence of social economic backward ess among marginalized groups. So that is dullets, that is moslems.

They&rsquo;re more used to diversity. They&rsquo;re more used to strange environments. The complacency is taken away once they leave their country, because it&rsquo;s not just they have done well, they have done especially well as leaders, in particular kind of leadership roles.
Speaker 1
I mean, i guess my hesitation in answering your question is that i hate assensualism. It&rsquo;s the same way that i hate it when people say women are better leaders because we are more ampathetic. Because the problem with esensual is the moment you pay yourself a compliment basis gender, cast, religion, color of your skin, whatever, country of your origin. If you got to accept one generalization as true, then you&rsquo;re going to have to suck up the generalizations and the caricatures that aren&rsquo;t so flattering. And i&rsquo;m justhe in going beyond saying certain caste groups, like certain gender groups, like certain religious groups, were more influential in terms of places that they occupied at the top of social hierarchies. So for example, you know, maybe exposure to culture among what so called upper cast groups was more because income was higher. Therefore there was a luxury of, let say, being also able to be exposed to classical music and classical dance. (

i haven&rsquo;t eaten so many quisines within my country, and i&rsquo;m 50. And it would take a lifetime for people to get to know indian food. The one thing we can ever be accused of is being blanda neither our food nor our people.

Why

is indian food the very best food in the ent world? That
Speaker 1
essentialism? Acalex bhet, i&rsquo;ll accept it. I&rsquo;ll tell you why. Because there&rsquo;s so many different kinds of it, right? I think the thing about this country, and in some ways, an unlikely country, in terms of not having a singular organizing principle to it, in terms of religion or language, just an abroad idea it is so diverse. The best thing about us is our diversity. And that diversity is reflected in food. I mean, i haven&rsquo;t eaten so many quisines within my country, and i&rsquo;m 50, and i have it. And it would take a lifetime for people to get to know indian food. And i think the biggest reas that it&rsquo;s so interesting is, one, because there isn&rsquo;t one thing called indian food. There isn&rsquo;t one kind of indian food. But mostly because of flavour and spices. The one thing we can ever be accused of is being blanda neither our food nor our people. And there&rsquo;s a lot of, sort of, obviously, experimentation with spice and with vor and the palateis just now, i don&rsquo;t know, become that there&rsquo;s no notion of ever having a meal that is not flavorful or full of aromas and spices. And i don&rsquo;t cook, but i eat a lot. As i said, that&rsquo;s one compliment i&rsquo;m happy to take as a generalized truth about my nation. As

you know, there are plenty of reports of food aid, say, rotting on the sides of the highways, not being delivered in time yet. What&rsquo;s also striking about most regional varieties of indian food is just how extraordinary the vegetables are. (
