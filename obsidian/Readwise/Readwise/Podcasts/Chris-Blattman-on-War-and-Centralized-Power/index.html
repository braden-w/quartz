He is a professor at the University of Chicago and most importantly for our purposes, he has a new and wonderful book out which I have blurbed. It is called why we fight the roots of war and the path to peace, chris welcome.
Speaker 1: Great to be back.
Speaker 0: I have many questions about war. Let&rsquo;s start with demographics. So Richard hanania made the argument recently in his substack that countries where there was only one child per family, we&rsquo;re going to be much less likely or willing or interested to fight wars. Do you agree?
Speaker 1: Because they put their Children at risk and they
Speaker 0: but also it&rsquo;s a sign they don&rsquo;t care that much about the future that they&rsquo;re (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/628513cb3782e70d24f7770c rel=noopener>Time¬†0:00:34</a>)</li><li>Speaker 0: we fight the roots of war and the path to peace, chris welcome.

Speaker 1: Because they put their Children at risk and they
Speaker 0: but also it&rsquo;s a sign they don&rsquo;t care that much about the future that they&rsquo;re complacent. They&rsquo;re not going to disrupt their lives just to have three kids. So if they&rsquo;re not going to disrupt their comfortable lives with three kids, they won&rsquo;t disrupt it for a war either.
Speaker 1: Yeah. That doesn&rsquo;t resonate with me. I don&rsquo;t think that the average person&rsquo;s wait on the future and the quality of their (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/628513d13782e70d24f77b41 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:00:50</a>)</li><li>Speaker 1: centric in the sense of having lots of super national powers so we can delegate a lot of authority and bind their hands through international treaties and agreements and alliances. We focus a little bit too much, I think on downward and federalist sort of polish centers in the United States,
Speaker 0: I know it&rsquo;s a small country and it&rsquo;s not near many other countries, but New Zealand is very non palla centric, right? If we put them somewhere else made them bigger, we think they would be more likely to go to war than say Canada.
Speaker 1: It&rsquo;s funny because I think of Canada as a not very palla centric place in at least a formal institutional sense, they&rsquo;re in a place where they don&rsquo;t have a lot of temptation to go to war. But I think that both societies, I&rsquo;ve never been to New Zealand, so I&rsquo;m more projecting from other places I know, including Canada onto it. I think they are palla centric in the sense that the country is (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/628514143782e70d24f7b9af rel=noopener>Time¬†0:03:43</a>)</li><li>Speaker 0: factor.
Speaker 1: So let me use a slightly different analogy. So like when I have thought about let&rsquo;s take Afghanistan and the U. S. Involvement Afghanistan, which was I have no particular expertise in the region. But when I try to understand myself, why was that such a long war? I think it&rsquo;s because it was not particularly expensive. The United States, the United States was saying this is going to cost us tens of lives per year and Maybe 1% of GDP and in return for that we are going to buy reputation for not tolerating rogue states and terror attacks by rogue states. And in return for that we&rsquo;re gonna have some probability diminishing over time a victory over this particular road group. And given that this rogue group will not negotiate with us and there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any ground where we can actually compromise because of our mutual intransigence. This is a cheap war and (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/628514843782e70d24f81613 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:08:35</a>)</li><li>Speaker 1: and in return for that we are going to buy reputation for not tolerating rogue states and terror attacks by rogue states. And in return for that we&rsquo;re gonna have some probability diminishing over time a victory over this particular road group. And given that this rogue group will not negotiate with us and there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any ground where we can actually compromise because of our mutual intransigence. This is a cheap war and will wage it. And that&rsquo;s not what they say to the public. But I think that&rsquo;s the fact of what happens. And so I think drones and technologies like doesn&rsquo;t make war cheap and if war is cheap then I think you&rsquo;re going to be more likely to use that as an instrument? And that&rsquo;s the first order that I think technology sort of gives us.
Speaker 0: So how much does state capacity predict war? I mean, should that be in your list of five main factors?
Speaker 1: State (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/6285148c3782e70d24f81d58 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:08:57</a>)</li><li>Speaker 0: capacity. That now seems wrong. What do you think we got wrong or you got wrong or I got wrong
Speaker 1: so long run, I still have high expectations for Ethiopia and I think short run things have obviously gotten very bad and you know, I have a couple of friends who worked very closely there and and so partly what I know channeling them. I think what was fundamentally problematic about that, like in a lot of african countries is that in spite of the state capacity you have power that&rsquo;s very concentrated in a handful of elite groups and these elite groups happened to be ethnic groups. So the Tigre and the Empire and the Romo and they&rsquo;d cut a deal with one another. They&rsquo;d cut a deal that for a long time, heavily, heavily, heavily favored the de grandes and that started to fray (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/628514b03782e70d24f8356b rel=noopener>Time¬†0:10:28</a>)</li><li>Speaker 0: that&rsquo;s one of the most destructive wars of all time and that seems to fit the nested games worry as the main driver of a lot of wars.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so maybe not surprisingly, we&rsquo;ve you very quickly brought us to the I think the bleeding edge of conflict research and the thing we don&rsquo;t understand very well, like when I think about the one area, I wish I understood better both the game theory, the strategic dynamics, the empirical would be the difficulties, coalition formation and the fact that I think fragmenting coalitions and many decentralized actors with the means of violence Is actually really destabilizing and I don&rsquo;t know how to think about it systematically because I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve had like 20 people with their shoulder behind the boulder pushing and trying to understand that.
Speaker 0: So we&rsquo;re talking today at the very beginning of March and we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen with Russia and Ukraine, but we know (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/628515683782e70d24f8c2de rel=noopener>Time¬†0:17:41</a>)</li><li>Speaker 0: In fact he did it or tried to do it right. That would be a case where if you pay attention to his ideas and speeches you would do very well. There just in the abstract, you might think it&rsquo;s crazy what guy would ever do this, but he did
Speaker 1: it. I mean if we just took all the leaders and all the things they said and then whether or not they did the things they said they were going to do. I guess my prediction is correlation to go in the other direction, particularly with military exercises. That might be wrong. I&rsquo;ve never seen someone run that, you know,
Speaker 0: I think of political speech as more informative. So China is insisting that within the hundredth-year anniversary of the revolution which would be 2049 that it will bring Taiwan back into the fold? Now, they may not succeed in doing that, but I strongly believe as a result of their words, that&rsquo;s what they intend to do and they will try very hard to do it. Why is (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/628515b03782e70d24f8f701 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:20:49</a>)</li><li>Speaker 0: China is insisting that within the hundredth-year anniversary of the revolution which would be 2049 that it will bring Taiwan back into the fold? Now, they may not succeed in doing that, but I strongly believe as a result of their words, that&rsquo;s what they intend to do and they will try very hard to do it. Why is that a mistaken inference? Why would they say it? What&rsquo;s wrong with the simple? They say it because they&rsquo;re selling the idea to the public and they believe it, and a lot of their public believes it and they want to do it.
Speaker 1: I&rsquo;m not saying there is no information, I&rsquo;m just saying most of the time you have two parties, I mean, we have the word brinksmanship for a reason, because people bring it to the brink and then they walk back and the language that is necessary to establish a bargaining position. I mean, let&rsquo;s put it in a totally different situation. You&rsquo;re negotiating in a market for a carpet, right, (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/628515bb3782e70d24f9020f rel=noopener>Time¬†0:21:17</a>)</li><li>Speaker 1: in a market for a carpet, right, and you have to sort of stake out. I said, oh, I could never pay that. Our whole ability to get a deal is actually contingent on me. Knowing that you have an incentive to actually say something that&rsquo;s false about your own intransigence, because it strengthens your bargaining power. And so maybe that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t believe political speech because the whole act of bargaining with an adversary is it&rsquo;s necessary for you to pretend that you will give less than you want. We all know this, we all do this instinctually, and it&rsquo;s a ritual, and more often than not you find the deal, you know, you don&rsquo;t walk away and eventually buy a carpet.
Speaker 0: But how&rsquo;s this for a theory? Political speech really matters in cases where there&rsquo;s no solomonic solution where you can just split the baby so you can&rsquo;t give Putin half of Ukraine, (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/628516013782e70d24f93ce9 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:21:59</a>)</li><li>Speaker 1: for you to pretend that you will give less than you want. We all know this, we all do this instinctually, and it&rsquo;s a ritual, and more often than not you find the deal, you know, you don&rsquo;t walk away and eventually buy a carpet.
Speaker 0: But how&rsquo;s this for a theory? Political speech really matters in cases where there&rsquo;s no solomonic solution where you can just split the baby so you can&rsquo;t give Putin half of Ukraine, Taiwan can&rsquo;t give china half of Taiwan. And then in those cases it actually indicates that there might be a likely conflict. Another case, this is plenty of bargaining. Right?
Speaker 1: Right. I mean, I think what&rsquo;s the problem though is actually the fact that we create a set of institutional or ideological rigidities that keep us from compromising. So that hasn&rsquo;t happened in Hong kong right? There&rsquo;s all these gradations of chinese control over Hong kong because (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/6285160a3782e70d24f94406 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:22:23</a>)</li><li>Speaker 1: they have in war, but actually ideological or glory driven preferences for status and status competition amongst themselves. So that&rsquo;s a reading of history that echoes and very loudly in my ears. Some of the patterns I see today.
Speaker 0: What do you think of the steven pinker thesis that basically war is diminishing over time consistently and for structural reasons?
Speaker 1: I mean, I think it&rsquo;s a plausible hypothesis that seems not to be true according to some of the people who I think have done the careful analysis of interstate and civil wars. And then I think if you look at other types of violence, particularly violence within societies within cities, you look at homicide. It&rsquo;s unassailably true. And so I think you have to evaluate that depending on the type of violence, interpersonal violence that can be (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/628ab1663782e70d2414c2c1 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:25:04</a>)</li><li>Speaker 0: about that wrong? Is is that the right distinction whether he expects he can survive or not. How would you think about that?
Speaker 1: Even ignoring the nuclear calculus in some sense, I think that the whole basis for this war or the whole basis for the aggression and the aggressive bargaining is Putin&rsquo;s desire to preserve and advance his control and his vision or maybe that network and that, that elite groups control and you know, not being a Russia expert, what possible threat does NATO or capitalism or democracy have to the average Russian, I don&rsquo;t see it. And even if it existed, I don&rsquo;t see a threat that&rsquo;s worth this kind of aggressive posturing and brinksmanship and invasion and possible use of nuclear weapons with the Ukraine. So it&rsquo;s all predicated on the interests of this group that&rsquo;s in power and how (

They went away, they came back home, maybe they were hailed as heroes, but they probably had a lot of PTSD. That&rsquo;s really not so much the case anymore. How has that changed american society?
Speaker 1: So they probably did have PTSD.
Speaker 0: Sure, yeah, a lot of them.
Speaker 1: Um,
Speaker 0: and now there&rsquo;s less of that. Obviously some veterans coming back from Afghanistan Iraq, but
Speaker 1: so there&rsquo;s less people having this marshall. Well, I would say like the experience, the first, the most important thing about this experience probably wasn&rsquo;t the exposure to trauma and PTSD, I would have thought the organizational experience and the bonding maybe a small fraction would have PTSD, but everyone would have come back with the military socialization for example, either depending on how that war conducted (

Speaker 0: especially for the younger members of congress. Is it a good thing that so few of them have served in the military or should we be concerned,
Speaker 1: we shouldn&rsquo;t make too much of these correlations. If you look at some of the people who have run correlations of what kinds of leaders are most likely to end up taking their country to war. It&rsquo;s ones who have been trained in the military but never fought in a war. And so you can imagine that there&rsquo;s sort of an inverse u shaped that no military experience or military experience with actually fighting a war or both lead you to be a verse and then there&rsquo;s that middle ground and that seems intuitively plausible to me at the same time, I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s on my top five list of things that would or would not make a congress person go to (

Speaker 0: for bouldering. What&rsquo;s the special skill that you need that most people don&rsquo;t appreciate.
Speaker 1: I think it&rsquo;s the fact that you have to not like other sports, it&rsquo;s the kind of thing that rewards intense focus and I think practice practice practice and so the extent that you like other physical activities, it may be all sports do this, but I think bouldering and particularly rewards single mindedness and so a lack of interest in other physical activities can be a benefit. You
Speaker 0: wrote some long a while ago, maybe it was even 2007 that people who work for development agencies should not expect to fly business class. What&rsquo;s your current view of that hypothesis?
Speaker 1: So, I still live by that (
