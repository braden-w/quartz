Summary:
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing good in my life right now. You can&rsquo;t find anything your life to be grateful for,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;On the drive home, i&rsquo;m not kidding you, i started to stack gratitude.&rdquo; His wife told him she didn&rsquo;t recognize who he was or what he was about. A stranger walked by his table and greeted him with a warm smile.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
at it. I had a couple f good things happened for me, or to me. One was, at that time, my wife did get frank with me, this is not who you are. This is what you&rsquo;re about. I don&rsquo;t recognize this person. This is who you are. And i had a other person, to my benefit, pointing out to me the things that were great about me. This is going to sound hoky, but i&rsquo;m going to give you the big one, and this is why life gives you these great tests. I had a really good friend of mine, i went to lunch, and he said, i don&rsquo;t know who this guy is here in front of me, ind he goes the mass. You question honestly right now, what are you grateful for? And at the lunch i said, jack, shit, nothing, brother. There&rsquo;s nothing good in my life right now. And i&rsquo;m not exaggerating this to you when i tell you this, and this is a factual story, as i&rsquo;m mouthing these words, people walked in with an older man. Both of them clearly were fighting cancer. Somehow both had lost their hair. One of the ladies had a bonnet on. And they were barely moving in both, walked by our table and gave me the most warm greeting, the warmest smile, as a stranger. Anigos, that&rsquo;s pretty frick and pathetic. You can&rsquo;t find anything your life to be grateful for right now. And on the drive home, i&rsquo;m not kidding you, i started to stack gratitude. I started to take inventory. Because if you can find things to be grateful for in that space, man, is your life going to be rich when there really are external things to be grateful for. So my first mechanism out of that space was, honestly, to stack the things i was grateful for. And i started reinforcing it over and over and over again. And what happens is, there&rsquo;s this particular activating system in our brains, right? (

Summary:
The way you move your body is an emotion. You don&rsquo;t just feel them, you do them. The quickest way to change our behavior, our emotions and our state is with our body. That&rsquo;s something that completely changed my life, obviously. And every time somebody asks me a question about, you know, how do i, i&rsquo;m lost. I feel out of control," he said.

out. That&rsquo;s something that
Speaker 2
completely changed my life, obviously. And every time somebody asks me a question about, you know, how do i, i&rsquo;m lost. I feel, you know, completely out of control. I don&rsquo;t have confidence. My answers work out too so,
Speaker 1
why? Well, i think everything in our bot, i think everything in our lives, starts with our body. If you&rsquo;re a person of faith, you believe that&rsquo;s where your soul is housed, right? And so it&rsquo;s the you you do emotions. You don&rsquo;t just feel them, you do them. In other words, and you know this from things you&rsquo;ve learned in your life, but like, joy is an actual action, not just an emotion. We feel a certain joy. There&rsquo;s a certain breathing, a certain movement in our body. Depression and sadness is something we do. We&rsquo;re more hunched over. Our breathing is more shallow, right? And so there&rsquo;s a correlation between the way you move your body and your emotions. There directly. This is even before we get to dopamen hits and our nervous system being. I&rsquo;m just telling you that the way you move your body is an emotion. You do emotions. And so when you move your body, you can&rsquo;t be in full workout mode, moving your body, running, king, jumping jacks, jump rope, and be depressed. They don&rsquo;t go together simultines because your body doesn&rsquo;t get the connectionn i&rsquo;m moving like i&rsquo;m joyful. I&rsquo;m moving like i&rsquo;m having sex. I&rsquo;m moving like i&rsquo;m happy. These are all joyful states. You can&rsquo;t be depressed simultaneously. So the quickest way to change our behavior, our emotions and our state is with our body. (

Summary:
Identity is the governor on our lives. It&rsquo;s the invisible force that no one understands. Once they do understand and get hold of it, their life can change. If you&rsquo;re at 80 degrees, that internal therm stet will find a way to cool your life right back down again. To be the most powerful force in the world, i think, is to be consistent with the concepts, ideas and worth that you hold for yourself.
Transcript:
Speaker 2
You&rsquo;ve
Speaker 1
leveraged identity really powerfully. How have you done it? And, like, what are some specific moments where identity came to your rescue? So identity is the governor on our lives. It&rsquo;s the invisible force that no one understands. And once they do understand and get hold of it, their life can change. And so not only, if you don&rsquo;t get hold of this, will these outward conditions of your life keep being exactly the same, but it&rsquo;s you could be ave differetly. Could do all the work andout you could be thinking great thoughts, but you are going to get out of your life. You&rsquo;re ging to be the most powerful force in the world, i think, is to be consistent with the concepts, ideas and worth that you hold for yourself. You will get that out of your life. What you will tolerate. The deeper part of that is identity. And so identity is very much likea mostat sitting on a wall, right? This is important. Once that temperature is set at a certain degree, everything in the world, externally, can hit it. And you will find a way to get that temperature. So even in this house, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s set at 80 degrees, if we opened up all the doors in cold air, just the worst things in life, the blizzard of life, came in, the thermostat will kick the heater and will regulate this room back to 80 degrees. The reverse is also true. It&rsquo;s a super hot day. Great things are happening in your life. It&rsquo;s getting hotter and hotter and hotter. If you&rsquo;re at 80 degrees, that internal therm stet will find a way, over a window of time, to cool your life right back down to 80 degrees again. So the key, the secret key, is to be able to shift that identity 90, a hundred, hundred, ad 20. So some of the way strategies to do that are very simple. One is, if i, let&rsquo;s thi safe financially. (
