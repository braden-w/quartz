Speaker 0: involved in some of the neurochemicals involved. We
Speaker 1: will talk about some of that
Speaker 0: today.
Speaker 1: Often overlooked however,
Speaker 0: is that memories are not just about learning. Memories are
Speaker 1: also about placing your entire
Speaker 0: life into a context
Speaker 2: and that&rsquo;s because what&rsquo;s
Speaker 1: really special about the
Speaker 2: brain and in particular
Speaker 0: the human brain is its ability to place events in the context of past events, the present
Speaker 2: and future
Speaker 0: events and sometimes even combinations of the past and
Speaker 1: present or present and
Speaker 2: future and so on.
Speaker 0: So when we talk about memory, what we&rsquo;re really talking about is how your immediate experiences relate to previous and future experiences. Today
Speaker 1: I&rsquo;m going to make clear how that process
Speaker 0: occurs. Even if you don&rsquo;t have a background in biology or psychology, I promise to put it into (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e36de6f4a6f5a96aac7f rel=noopener>Time¬†0:00:28</a>)<ul><li>Note: The human brain is fantastic for being able to understand past and future</li></ul></li><li>Speaker 0: with all the things that are
Speaker 1: happening in any one given
Speaker 0: moment. Now, memory is simply a bias in
Speaker 2: which perceptions
Speaker 0: will be replayed again in the future
Speaker 2: anytime you
Speaker 0: experience something that is the consequence
Speaker 2: of specific
Speaker 0: chains of neurons that we call
Speaker 2: neural circuits
Speaker 0: being activated. And memory is simply a bias in the likelihood that that specific chain of neurons
Speaker 1: will be activated
Speaker 0: again. So, for instance, if you can remember your name and I certainly hope that you can Well that means that there are specific chains of neurons in
Speaker 1: your brain
Speaker 0: that represent your
Speaker 1: name. And when
Speaker 0: those neurons
Speaker 1: connect with one
Speaker 0: another and
Speaker 1: communicate electrically
Speaker 2: with one another in a particular sequence
Speaker 0: you remember your name. (

Speaker 1: Most of us can&rsquo;t
Speaker 0: do that or at least it requires a
Speaker 1: lot of effort in training.
Speaker 0: However,
Speaker 1: there are things that we can do that
Speaker 0: leverage the natural
Speaker 1: biology of our nervous
Speaker 0: system to
Speaker 2: enhance learning and memory of
Speaker 0: particular perceptions and particular information. Let&rsquo;s
Speaker 2: first just talk about the most
Speaker 0: basic ways that we learn and remember things and how to improve
Speaker 2: learning and memory
Speaker 0: And the most basic one is repetition. The study of memory
Speaker 2: and the
Speaker 0: role of repetition actually dates back to the late 18 hundreds, early 19 hundreds when ebbing House developed the first
Speaker 2: so called learning
Speaker 0: curves.
Speaker 2: Learning curves are
Speaker 0: simply what results when you quantify (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e524e6f4a6f5a96ae5a9 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:13:25</a>)<ul><li>Note: Learning curves and Ebinghaus</li></ul></li><li>Speaker 0: actually dates back to the late 18 hundreds, early 19 hundreds when ebbing House developed the first
Speaker 2: so called learning
Speaker 0: curves.
Speaker 2: Learning curves are
Speaker 0: simply what results when you quantify how
Speaker 2: many repetitions of something
Speaker 0: are required in order to remember something. In fact it&rsquo;s been said that Ending House liberated
Speaker 2: the understanding of
Speaker 0: learning from the philosophers by generating
Speaker 2: these learning
Speaker 0: curves. What do you mean by that? Well,
Speaker 2: before
Speaker 0: heading House came along,
Speaker 2: learning
Speaker 1: and memory were thought to be philosophical
Speaker 0: ideas. Ending House came along and said,
Speaker 1: well let&rsquo;s actually take
Speaker 0: some measurements, let&rsquo;s measure how well I can remember a sequence of words or a sequence of numbers if I just repeat them. So what ending
Speaker 2: House did is he (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e524e6f4a6f5a96ae5f7 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:13:58</a>)<ul><li>Note: Learning Curves</li></ul></li><li>Speaker 2: he would
Speaker 0: write down as many of them
Speaker 2: as he could and he would try
Speaker 0: and keep them in the same
Speaker 2: sequence. Then he would
Speaker 0: compare to the original list and he would see how many errors he made
Speaker 1: you do this over
Speaker 0: and over and over again.
Speaker 2: And as you would expect
Speaker 0: early in the training
Speaker 1: and the learning,
Speaker 0: it took a lot more repetitions to get the sequence
Speaker 1: correct and over time
Speaker 2: it took fewer
Speaker 0: sequences. And he
Speaker 1: referred to that difference
Speaker 0: in the
Speaker 1: initial number of
Speaker 0: repetitions that he had to perform
Speaker 1: versus
Speaker 0: the later number of repetitions that he had to perform as a so called savings.
Speaker 2: So he literally
Speaker 0: thought of the brain as
Speaker 1: having to
Speaker 0: generate a kind of a currency
Speaker 2: of effort and
Speaker 0: he talked about savings
Speaker 2: as the reduction
Speaker 0: in the amount of effort that he had to
Speaker 2: put forward in
Speaker 1: order to learn information
Speaker 0: and what (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e524e6f4a6f5a96ae5d4 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:14:53</a>)<ul><li>Note: How Ebinghaus found the learning curve (and relating it to a currency)</li></ul></li><li>Speaker 2: a memory
Speaker 0: and that might all seem like a big
Speaker 2: duh, but prior to
Speaker 0: having House, none of that was known now. I should also say Leading house because of when he was alive, was not aware of these things that we called neural circuits, it was in 1906, that
Speaker 2: Goldy
Speaker 0: alcohol got the Nobel
Speaker 2: prize for actually showing that neurons are independent
Speaker 0: cells connected by synapses, these little gaps between them where they communicate. So he may have been aware of
Speaker 2: that, but the whole
Speaker 0: notion of neural circuits hadn&rsquo;t really come about.
Speaker 1: Nevertheless, what the ending
Speaker 0: house learning curves really established was that sheer
Speaker 1: repetition,
Speaker 0: just repeating things
Speaker 1: over and over and
Speaker 0: over again is sufficient
Speaker 2: to learn
Speaker 0: something that no doubt had been observed before, but
Speaker 2: had never been
Speaker 0: formally quantified.
Speaker 2: Now,
Speaker 0: if we look
Speaker 2: at that result, (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e524e6f4a6f5a96ae5b1 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:16:05</a>)<ul><li>Note: Sheer repetition allowed him to learn</li></ul></li><li>Speaker 2: that allowed him
Speaker 1: to
Speaker 2: remember now, sometimes later in the early
Speaker 0: to mid 1920s,
Speaker 2: a psychologist
Speaker 0: in Canada named Donald Hebb came up with what
Speaker 1: was called heads
Speaker 0: postulate and heads
Speaker 1: postulate,
Speaker 0: broadly speaking, is this idea
Speaker 2: that if a
Speaker 0: sequence of neurons is
Speaker 2: active at
Speaker 1: the same time
Speaker 0: or at roughly the same time
Speaker 1: that that would
Speaker 0: lead to a strengthening of the connections between those
Speaker 2: neurons and many,
Speaker 0: many decades
Speaker 2: of experimentation. Later we
Speaker 0: now know that postulate
Speaker 1: to be true neurons
Speaker 0: themselves
Speaker 2: are not smart, they don&rsquo;t have
Speaker 0: knowledge. So every memory is the consequences
Speaker 2: I told you before
Speaker 0: of the repeated activation
Speaker 1: of a particular chain
Speaker 2: of neurons
Speaker 0: and (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e524e6f4a6f5a96ae5c1 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:17:09</a>)<ul><li>Note: Ebinghaus doesn‚Äôt consider that information memorized wasn‚Äôt more interesting on second attempt</li></ul></li><li>Speaker 0: leads to a
Speaker 2: bias in the probability that those neurons
Speaker 1: will be active again.
Speaker 0: This is vitally important because nowadays we hear a
Speaker 2: lot about how
Speaker 0: memories are the consequence
Speaker 2: of new neurons
Speaker 1: added in the brain
Speaker 0: or that
Speaker 2: every
Speaker 0: time you learn something, a new connection
Speaker 1: in your brain forms
Speaker 2: well, sorry to
Speaker 0: break it to you, but that&rsquo;s simply
Speaker 2: not the case
Speaker 1: most of the time and I want
Speaker 2: to emphasize
Speaker 1: most not all, but most of the
Speaker 2: time when we learn
Speaker 0: something, it&rsquo;s because
Speaker 1: existing neurons,
Speaker 2: not new
Speaker 0: neurons, but existing neurons strengthen their connection through
Speaker 1: co
Speaker 0: activation over and over and over through repetition or
Speaker 1: and this is a very important
Speaker 0: or or through very strong
Speaker 2: activation
Speaker 0: once and only
Speaker 2: once. (

Speaker 0: These sorts of things. That&rsquo;s an explicit
Speaker 1: declarative memory, but
Speaker 2: you also have
Speaker 0: explicit
Speaker 2: procedural memories.
Speaker 0: Now, procedural memories, as
Speaker 2: the name suggests,
Speaker 0: involved action sequences. The Simplest one, it&rsquo;s
Speaker 2: almost ridiculously simple, is
Speaker 0: walking. If I say, how
Speaker 2: Is it that you walk from one room
Speaker 0: to the other? You&rsquo;d probably
Speaker 2: say, well I go that direction,
Speaker 0: I turned left, I said no, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: How is it
Speaker 0: exactly that you do it and say,
Speaker 2: well I move my left foot and my right foot and my left foot. And you could describe
Speaker 1: that. So it&rsquo;s an
Speaker 0: explicit procedural memory.
Speaker 2: So much so that if you were
Speaker 0: going to teach a
Speaker 2: young toddler how to
Speaker 1: walk, you would probably
Speaker 0: say, okay, good, good try, Okay,
Speaker 1: and you, you know, probably that&rsquo;s going to be pre language for the toddler,
Speaker 0: but you&rsquo;re going
Speaker 1: to encourage them to move
Speaker 0: one (

Speaker 1: and you&rsquo;re going to
Speaker 0: encourage and reward
Speaker 1: Them for moving one leg
Speaker 2: than the other because you
Speaker 0: have an explicit procedural
Speaker 2: memory of how
Speaker 0: to walk. Okay.
Speaker 2: Almost ridiculously simple.
Speaker 0: Maybe even truly
Speaker 2: ridiculously simple,
Speaker 0: but nonetheless,
Speaker 2: when you think about
Speaker 0: in the context of neural
Speaker 1: circuits and neural firing. Pretty
Speaker 2: amazing.
Speaker 0: Even more amazing
Speaker 1: is the fact
Speaker 0: that all
Speaker 1: explicit memories,
Speaker 2: both
Speaker 1: declarative and
Speaker 2: procedural explicit
Speaker 1: memories can be (

Speaker 1: formed.
Speaker 2: It is not
Speaker 1: where those memories are
Speaker 0: stored and maintained.
Speaker 2: It is
Speaker 0: where they are established in the
Speaker 2: first place, in
Speaker 0: contrast, implicit memories, right?
Speaker 1: These subconscious
Speaker 2: memories are
Speaker 0: formed and
Speaker 1: stored elsewhere in the brain,
Speaker 2: mainly
Speaker 0: by areas like the cerebellum, but also the neocortex,
Speaker 1: the kind of outer shell
Speaker 0: of your brain. The cerebellum
Speaker 2: is literally means
Speaker 0: mini brain
Speaker 2: and it does in fact look like a mini brain
Speaker 0: and is in the
Speaker 2: back of the brain. And
Speaker 0: the neocortex is the outer part of the brain that covers all the other stuff. So the
Speaker 2: hippocampus is vitally
Speaker 0: important for establishing these new
Speaker 2: declarative memories
Speaker 0: of what you
Speaker 2: know and
Speaker 1: what you know how
Speaker 0: to (

Speaker 0: out the
Speaker 2: hippocampus in the brain of hmm and as a
Speaker 0: consequence he lost all
Speaker 1: explicit memory.
Speaker 2: Now. The consequence of this was
Speaker 1: that he couldn&rsquo;t exist
Speaker 0: in normal everyday
Speaker 1: life, like most people,
Speaker 2: so he
Speaker 1: had to live
Speaker 2: mostly, not not entirely, but mostly
Speaker 0: in a kind of hospital
Speaker 2: setting. And I&rsquo;ve
Speaker 0: talked to several people
Speaker 2: who have, who
Speaker 0: I should say,
Speaker 1: who met H. M.
Speaker 2: Directly because he&rsquo;s no
Speaker 1: longer alive.
Speaker 2: But
Speaker 1: an
Speaker 0: interaction with him might
Speaker 1: look like the following.
Speaker 0: He would walk up to you just fine. You wouldn&rsquo;t know that he had any kind of brain
Speaker 2: damage,
Speaker 0: He could walk fine,
Speaker 2: he could speak fine.
Speaker 1: And he&rsquo;d say, hi,
Speaker 0: I&rsquo;m Andrew and he&rsquo;d say, hi,
Speaker 2: I&rsquo;m whatever his
Speaker 1: name happened to be a (

Speaker 0: the names of people
Speaker 1: that he had
Speaker 0: met much earlier
Speaker 1: in his life and so
Speaker 0: on. And
Speaker 1: yet he couldn&rsquo;t form
Speaker 2: new memories
Speaker 1: now in violation to that
Speaker 2: last statement. There were some elements of hmm
Speaker 1: emotionality
Speaker 2: that
Speaker 1: suggests that there was some
Speaker 0: sort of residual
Speaker 2: capacity to
Speaker 1: learn new
Speaker 0: information. But it wasn&rsquo;t
Speaker 2: what we normally
Speaker 0: think of as
Speaker 2: explicit declarative or
Speaker 0: procedural memory for
Speaker 2: instance, it&rsquo;s been reported
Speaker 0: or it&rsquo;s been said I
Speaker 1: should say because I don&rsquo;t know
Speaker 0: that the studies were ever
Speaker 1: done with intense physiological measurements
Speaker 2: that if you
Speaker 0: were to tell h.
Speaker 2: M. A joke.
Speaker 1: And he thought it was funny. He would laugh
Speaker 2: really hard.
Speaker 0: So he liked jokes. So you tell me you say hmm, I want to tell you a
Speaker 1: joke. You tell (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/6293e56ee6f4a6f5a96aed42 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:32:17</a>)<ul><li>Note: HM could remember old memories and how to walk</li></ul></li><li>Speaker 0: funny just
Speaker 2: as keep
Speaker 0: this in mind, folks,
Speaker 2: if you tell a joke
Speaker 1: and you get a big laugh,
Speaker 2: don&rsquo;t tell it
Speaker 0: again, at least
Speaker 1: not immediately, not to the same
Speaker 0: person or the same
Speaker 1: crowd. Because the second time, it&rsquo;s a little less
Speaker 0: funny. And the third time, it&rsquo;s a little
Speaker 1: less funny. And that actually has to
Speaker 0: do with the whole element
Speaker 2: of dopamine
Speaker 0: and its relationship
Speaker 2: to surprise.
Speaker 0: And that&rsquo;s the topic of
Speaker 2: a future podcast where we
Speaker 0: talk all about humor
Speaker 2: and novelty
Speaker 0: in the brain.
Speaker 2: But the point
Speaker 0: being that
Speaker 1: certain forms of
Speaker 2: memory seem to exist
Speaker 0: in a kind of phantom like way within HMOs
Speaker 1: brain. What do I mean by that?
Speaker 2: Well
Speaker 0: this underscores the fact that he had an
Speaker 1: implicit memory
Speaker 0: of having heard
Speaker 1: the joke before
Speaker 2: and it suggests
Speaker 0: that humor
Speaker 2: or at least what we find funny is somehow more related (

Speaker 0: wounds and other
Speaker 2: forms of what
Speaker 0: we call infarct. Infarct.
Speaker 1: I. N.
Speaker 0: F. A. R. C. T. Infarct
Speaker 2: is the
Speaker 0: word we use to describe damage
Speaker 1: to a particular brain region.
Speaker 2: Then
Speaker 1: many different
Speaker 2: patients with many different patterns of
Speaker 1: infarct have
Speaker 0: taught us a
Speaker 2: lot about how memory and
Speaker 0: other aspects of the brain
Speaker 2: work
Speaker 1: hmm
Speaker 0: really teaches
Speaker 2: us
Speaker 1: that what we
Speaker 2: know and what
Speaker 0: we are able to do
Speaker 2: is the consequence of things
Speaker 0: that we are aware of
Speaker 1: and learnings
Speaker 0: that have been passed off
Speaker 2: into subconscious
Speaker 1: knowledge that our body
Speaker 0: knows our
Speaker 2: brain knows but
Speaker 1: we don&rsquo;t know
Speaker 2: exactly how we
Speaker 1: know that thing
Speaker 0: and I tell you the story
Speaker 1: about H. M. S. Ability
Speaker 2: to understand (

Speaker 0: But the problem for most
Speaker 2: people is that they either don&rsquo;t have the
Speaker 0: patients, they don&rsquo;t have the time and sometimes they literally don&rsquo;t have the time
Speaker 1: because they&rsquo;ve got a deadline
Speaker 0: on something that they&rsquo;re trying
Speaker 1: to remember and learn
Speaker 2: or they simply would
Speaker 0: like to be able
Speaker 1: to remember things
Speaker 0: better in general remember them more
Speaker 2: quickly.
Speaker 0: This process of
Speaker 2: accelerating
Speaker 0: repetition based learning
Speaker 2: so
Speaker 0: that your learning curve doesn&rsquo;t go from having to perform
Speaker 2: Something 1000 times and then gradually
Speaker 0: Over time it&rsquo;s one
Speaker 2: 1750 times a day,
Speaker 0: 500 times a day, 300 times a day and down to no
Speaker 2: repetitions right? You can just perform that thing the first time
Speaker 1: and every time. Well
Speaker 0: there is a way
Speaker 2: to shift that
Speaker 0: curve so
Speaker 2: that you
Speaker 0: can essentially establish (

And um and what they used as uh markers of good genes are things like symmetrical features uh and masculine features, so strong jawline, high shoulder to hip ratio. Um You know, other other sorts of masculine features. But I started to doubt this explanation for what women want in the short term. Um because of some other findings. So for for (

In contrast to that, I am a a terrible uh almost idiotic level journalist. So this is what you have to deal with. Another thing that people talk about that women care about is penis size. This penis size matter for women in sexual selection.
Speaker 1: Well, um there&rsquo;s controversy about that
Speaker 0: in the evolution of psychology community.
Speaker 1: Well, is their

Speaker 1: getting your brain and body into a very calm
Speaker 2: and yet alert state. So high
Speaker 1: attentional state that
Speaker 2: will allow you to focus on what it is that you&rsquo;re trying to learn.
Speaker 1: We know focus is
Speaker 2: vital for encoding information and for
Speaker 1: triggering neural plasticity,
Speaker 2: but
Speaker 1: remaining calm throughout
Speaker 2: that time and then afterwards spiking adrenaline
Speaker 1: and
Speaker 2: allowing adrenaline to have these incredible effects on reducing the

Speaker 1: me, you&rsquo;re learning about this information, this beautiful work
Speaker 0: of Logan and cahill and
Speaker 2: others and thinking,
Speaker 0: wow,
Speaker 1: I should perhaps
Speaker 0: consider spiking my adrenaline in one form or another
Speaker 1: at the
Speaker 0: tail end or immediately
Speaker 2: following an
Speaker 0: attempt to learn something.
Speaker 1: And yet

Speaker 0: So, here I am reading and I

So uh in terms of, I don&rsquo;t know, um magnitude of effects, it&rsquo;s an effect size of more than a standard deviation difference between the means um on this psychological sex difference. And so one of the interesting things is so if you go to places like go to the most um gender. egalitarian cultures in the world. So places like Sweden or Norway which are explicitly gender egalitarian and and are truly in many, many ways. But you allow people freedom of choice. This some of these sex differences actually get larger. The psychological sex differences and also (

Speaker 0: And
Speaker 1: I published a study a while back on on what&rsquo;s were called unmitigated agency and unmitigated communion. So you they&rsquo;re like
Speaker 0: good and bad
Speaker 1: aspects
Speaker 0: of agency
Speaker 1: and Communion so they
Speaker 0: can go, so there&rsquo;s toxic, as they say, masculinity, toxic femininity. You can just rephrase that saying there could be toxic agency and toxic communion.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. And so and so some
Speaker 0: elements
Speaker 1: of masculinity, uh the
Speaker 0: unmitigated
Speaker 1: masculinity is,
Speaker 0: I think
Speaker 1: terrible. I was actually walking around downtown Austin earlier today, just give this example. And this guy (

There&rsquo;s something that where the car is like a vessel for psychological experiment of how much stress you can take. And some people that stresses like heating uh is making the water boil and it&rsquo;s fascinating to see what that results in, I think if you are the kind of person that explodes (

Speaker 1: I would look at something and decide to just
Speaker 2: snap a mental snapshot of it.
Speaker 0: And I&rsquo;ve maintained very
Speaker 2: clear memories of those
Speaker 1: visual scenes. Two
Speaker 2: years ago
Speaker 1: I was in an Uber
Speaker 2: and I looked out the window and it was a street scene. I
Speaker 0: was actually in new york
Speaker 2: at the time and I decided
Speaker 1: for reasons that are still unclear
Speaker 2: to me
Speaker 1: to take a mental snapshot
Speaker 2: of this city street image
Speaker 1: even though nothing
Speaker 2: interesting in particular was
Speaker 1: happening. And
Speaker 2: um I do recall that there was a guy wearing a yellow shirt walking, there was some construction etcetera. I can still
Speaker 0: see that image in my
Speaker 2: mind&rsquo;s eye because I took this mental snapshot.
Speaker 1: This paper addresses whether
Speaker 2: or not this mental snapshot ng thing is real and this is
Speaker 0: something that I think a lot of
Speaker 2: people will resonate with
Speaker 1: whether or not the constant
Speaker 0: taking of pictures on our phones
Speaker 2: or with other devices (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/62a657c03f707348d6cc28fe rel=noopener>Time¬†1:43:02</a>)<ul><li>Note: Taking a mental snapshop as a form of photographic memory</li></ul></li><li>Speaker 1: the position of
Speaker 2: the handles, how how
Speaker 0: broad or narrow these
Speaker 2: things are.
Speaker 0: You know, a lot of this is pretty
Speaker 2: detailed stuff. They also
Speaker 0: took photos of other
Speaker 1: other things.
Speaker 2: So basically
Speaker 0: what they found was that if people take
Speaker 2: pictures of things and
Speaker 0: they choose which things
Speaker 2: they&rsquo;re taking pictures
Speaker 1: of. Right? It&rsquo;s up to them. It&rsquo;s
Speaker 2: volitional that there&rsquo;s enhanced memory
Speaker 1: for those objects
Speaker 0: later on.
Speaker 1: However, it degraded their
Speaker 2: ability to remember auditory information. So what this means
Speaker 1: is that when we take a picture of something or a person,
Speaker 2: we are
Speaker 1: stamping down a visual
Speaker 2: memory of that thing and that makes
Speaker 1: sense. It&rsquo;s a photograph after all. But we are actually
Speaker 0: inhibiting our
Speaker 1: ability to remember
Speaker 2: the auditory,
Speaker 0: the sound component
Speaker 2: of that visual scene (

Speaker 1: when they encoded the memory
Speaker 2: or
Speaker 0: whether or not those neurons were played in a
Speaker 1: different sequence or
Speaker 2: even if those neurons were played activated. That is
Speaker 1: all at once with no temporal
Speaker 2: sequence, all firing in
Speaker 0: concert all at
Speaker 1: once evoked the same
Speaker 2: behavior and in some sense
Speaker 0: the same memory.
Speaker 2: So at a
Speaker 1: neural circuit level, this is
Speaker 2: deja vu,
Speaker 0: this is
Speaker 1: a different pattern
Speaker 0: of firing of neurons
Speaker 1: in the brain, leading
Speaker 0: to the same sense
Speaker 1: of what
Speaker 2: happened, leading
Speaker 1: to a
Speaker 2: particular emotional state
Speaker 0: or behavior.
Speaker 2: Whether
Speaker 0: or (

Speaker 1: like so much because
Speaker 0: they used a really
Speaker 2: broad array
Speaker 1: of measurements
Speaker 2: for cognitive function,
Speaker 1: Things like the Wisconsin card sorting
Speaker 2: task. I&rsquo;m not gonna go into this things like
Speaker 0: the Stroop task
Speaker 2: and they also, as I
Speaker 1: mentioned, measured cortisol
Speaker 0: and many other things,
Speaker 1: including not surprisingly,
Speaker 2: memory
Speaker 0: and people&rsquo;s ability to
Speaker 1: remember certain types of
Speaker 2: information. In fact
Speaker 1: very types of information. And
Speaker 0: the basic takeaway
Speaker 1: was again that you could get really robust
Speaker 0: improvements
Speaker 1: in learning and memory,
Speaker 2: mood and attention
Speaker 1: From just 13 minutes a
Speaker 2: day of meditation. Now there&rsquo;s an important
Speaker 1: twist in this study that I want to
Speaker 2: emphasize. If you read into
Speaker 1: the discussion of this study,
Speaker 2: it&rsquo;s mentioned (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/62a657c03f707348d6cc2931 rel=noopener>Time¬†1:56:41</a>)<ul><li>Note: Huge gains in memory with 13 minutes of meditation per day.</li></ul></li><li>Speaker 2: order to participate or they&rsquo;re
Speaker 1: given um something
Speaker 0: as compensation for being
Speaker 1: the study. But oftentimes the
Speaker 2: meditation or in the case of
Speaker 1: my lab, the respiration work or other
Speaker 0: kinds of um
Speaker 2: things that they&rsquo;re assigned to
Speaker 1: do are not their
Speaker 2: top top priority and
Speaker 0: we understand this. But
Speaker 1: in this study, the majority of subjects here I&rsquo;m reading completed their meditation,
Speaker 2: sent sessions from
Speaker 1: eight somewhere
Speaker 0: between eight and
Speaker 2: 11 p.m. and sometimes
Speaker 0: even between
Speaker 1: 12 and three a.m.
Speaker 2: I think there probably were a lot of college students enrolled in this study and they&rsquo;re ours
Speaker 1: often our late
Speaker 0: shifted
Speaker 1: that impaired
Speaker 0: sleep. And this raises a
Speaker 1: bigger theme that I think is important many times before on this
Speaker 2: podcast. And certainly in the
