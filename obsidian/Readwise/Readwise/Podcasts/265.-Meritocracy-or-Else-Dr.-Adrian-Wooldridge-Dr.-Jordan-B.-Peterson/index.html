Summary:
iC tests are the most powerful technology that research psychologists have ever invented by a large margin. The american military decided, i believe, all three branches, and i believe this was in the 19 eighties, that it was illegal to induct someone into the armed forces if they had an ece of less than 82. That&rsquo;s ten per cent of the population. And that is a dismal statistic, because the military is chronically hungry for people. If their conclusion after close to 100 years of icu testing was that 10 % of the population can&rsquo;t be trained to do anything of any utility in the military that has, well, that speaks for itself,.

tests. Intelligence tests, is they are the most powerful technology that research psychologists have ever invented by a large margin. And so if we ed them in some metaphoricl sense to surgery, we might say, well, you don&rsquo;t want surgery. Might be necessary, but you don&rsquo;t want to do it without an anaesthetic, and you also want to be aware that the scalpel can kill. And so i think partly what we&rsquo;re wrestling with is that, among many other things, is the fact that these tests are of credible power in terms of their predictive ability. And were not exactly sure what to do with that. Mean, when i started familiarizing myself with the i c literature, it was actually quite disheartening in some sense, because i started to understand just how broad the ability range among human beings is, and how intractable that is in some measures, in the lower, let&rsquo;s say, tenth so one stat i came across at one point, and you detailed the use of icu tests by the american military. They were picked up very rapidly by the military, and very successfully, and with many
Speaker 1
positive social consequences. But,
Speaker 2
you know, the american military decided, i believe, all three branches, and i believe this was in the 19 eighties, that it was illegal, it&rsquo;s now illegal in the us. To induct someone into the armed forces if they have an ece of less than 82. And that&rsquo;s ten %, proximately ten % of the population. And that is a dismal statistic, because the military is chronically hungry for people. And if their conclusion after close to a hundred years of icu testing was that ten % of the population can&rsquo;t be trained to do anything of any utility in the military that has,
Speaker 1
well, that
Speaker 2
speaks for itself, if you think it through. And it&rsquo;s no wonder people are leary of these tests, and they&rsquo;re leary of what they reveal. And the easy thing to say is, well, what they reveal isn&rsquo;t true, you know, it&rsquo;s the tests themselves. But i&rsquo;m afraid i couldn&rsquo;t swallow that. I spent ten years looking at the ic (

Summary:
i think part of the problem is terminology. Part of what makes people resistant to this, because we also tend to sort of casually talk about elite institutions which in clo implies a kind of moral valuing. And that&rsquo;s really a catastrophe. Just because you&rsquo;re smart, doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re good. It doesn&rsquo;t means you&rsquo;re wise or meritorious. Doesn&rsquo;t even necessarily mean your decisions are going to be better than those other people would make using other means. So i believe, i read a paper at one point that suggested that you were much better off in the united states if you were born in the top cortil of ic than if you werent born in thetop cort
Transcript:
Speaker 2
And so we assume, now, i think, that if i have a job, my job, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what the job is, is to produce something productive that other people value, in as efficient a manner as possible, at a cost that&rsquo;s less than what i&rsquo;m paid, right? Right? And all those assumptions are questionable and a right, iann they&rsquo;re not natural kinds, which is partly what you&rsquo;re pointing out. And to and then, ok, so all right, so l except that, let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s go to the other side of this for a minute. So part of the problem, i think, is terminology. Part of what makes people resistant to this, because we also tend to sort of casually talk about elite institutions, which in clo implies a kind of moral valuing. We talk about meritocracy, which implies that the people at the top are of greater merit, right? And that means, to the degree that maritocracy is established on the basis of, let&rsquo;s say, fluid intelligence, that we&rsquo;re conflacting moral worth with abstract intellectual ability. And that&rsquo;s really a catastrophe. And that&rsquo;s part of the pride of intellect. And you talked about, ah, the best and the brightest and, and one of the criticism that that book levelled against the meritocracy was precisely one of intellectual pretension and arrogance, right? It&rsquo;s, just because you&rsquo;re smart, doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re good. It doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re wise, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re meritorious. It doesn&rsquo;t even necessarily mean that the decisions you make are going to be better than decisions other people would make using other means. Now, it&rsquo;s complicated, because, as you point out in the book, it&rsquo;s quite likely, if you&rsquo;re in the top, let&rsquo;s say, tenth of the ic distribution, and you start poor, that you won&rsquo;t end up poor. We&rsquo;re right. And so i believe, i read a paper at one point that suggested that you were much better off in the united states if you were born in the top cortil of ic than if you werent born in the top cortile of wealth. If you had to pick at birth. Yes,

Summary:
" volunteer jobs are actually harder to get in many ways than paying jobs now, because there&rsquo;s so many police checks and that sort of thing you have to go through," he says. &ldquo;It was something i could do without thinking, and he couldn&rsquo;t really do it after 30 hours of training.&rdquo; &lsquo;What we&rsquo;re doing right now, i think, is shooting the messenger,&rsquo; Obama adds.
Transcript:
Speaker 2
And it was something i could do without thinking, and he couldn&rsquo;t really do it after 30 hours of training. And so it i struggled for about a year and a half to find a volunteer job.
Speaker 1
And
Speaker 2
it turns out, you know, volunteer jobs are actually harder to get in many ways than paying jobs now, because there&rsquo;s so many police checks and that sort of thing you have to go through, and they&rsquo;re very technically challenging. I sent him to a government agency that that was hypothetically designed to help people like him find a job, and they said, you know, type up your resume and send it out. It&rsquo;s like, well, he can&rsquo;t type, and he doesn&rsquo;t have a resume and he can&rsquo;t use a computer, and that&rsquo;s not helpful. Thank you very much. You have no idea what you&rsquo;re dealing with here. And so this ten % of the population, let&rsquo;s say, the liberals think you can train anyone to do anything, which is rubbish. And the conservatives think if you work hard enough, there&rsquo;s no obstacles to your success. And that&rsquo;s also rubbish in some situations, because hard work alone isn&rsquo;t going to do it. And so we have a real conundrum. Now what we&rsquo;re doing right now, i think, is shooting the messenger. It&rsquo;s like we don&rsquo;t want to hear this, so we&rsquo;ll get rid of tests that are valid and reliable. (

Summary:
Differences within groups are much bigger than average differences between groups, evidently. But it is a very american set of data. And i think that what we&rsquo;re saying in britain at the moment, which is very interesting, i think,. We&rsquo;ve had a series of a schools which are called academies a, which a a bit like American magnet schools. Theres a lot of them in the east end of london, in poorer parts of other cities. These schools have been extremely good at getting members of ethnic minorities into high quality universities. They now get as many or more children every year into oxbridge than eton does a so and again, you know, in the united

On the ethmic differences, an on te the group difference oy, because these are differences between group averages, and thatthat, you know, there is an incredibly wide range ofer talents and abilities within groups. Differences within groups are much bigger than average differences between groups, evidently. But it is a very american set of data. And i think that what we&rsquo;re saying in britain at the moment, which is very interesting, i think, is that we&rsquo;ve had a series of a schools which are called academies a, which a a bit like american magnet schools, but they&rsquo;re schools that can select people at the age of 16, once they&rsquo;ve done their own levels, when they&rsquo;re going to a levels. Theres a lot of them in the east end of london, in poorer parts of other cities. And we found that these schools, which have been very academically rigorous, very focused on achievement, have been designed to say that if you&rsquo;ve a poor population, what you need to do to it is to give it opportunity and give it rigor, rather than a sort of dumb down education. And these schools have been extremely good at getting members of ethnic minorities into high quality universities. So there&rsquo;s one called brampton manor academy in the east end of london, which has an ethnic minority dominant population, which has the majority of its students have free school meals, which is a measure of poverty. And they now get as many or more children every year into oxbridge than eton does a so and again, you have, you know, in the united five %
Speaker 2
or total numbera
Speaker 1
total number. So in fact, by %, i think that would would be better, cause etin&rsquo;s a very big school. So these schools have been doing amazingly well, and they&rsquo;ve surprisedeve body by how successful they&rsquo;ve been. (

Summary:
In the u k thon we have a los of the currents that you have in the united states, but in a sort of weaker way. The attitude that men are people who do things with their hands is perfectly useful when you&rsquo;re in industrial society. And there&rsquo;s plenty of honor in that as well. So it&rsquo;s not easy for that to be replaced when that was the basis of productive effort itself and of success. But i think both the new tories and the old labor people can agree that, you now the old aristocratic alet, there&rsquo;s something wrong with them.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
Yes,
Speaker 2
while the the attitude that men are people who do things with their handsis perfectly useful attitude in industrial society when you&rsquo;re in the lower strat of the population, because that&rsquo;s exactly what the case is. And there&rsquo;s plenty of honor in that as well. And so it&rsquo;s not easy for that to be replaced when that was the basis of productive effort itself and of success. So why do you think that your book has been positively received? All things considered, in the u k? Is the assault on the meritocracy, let&rsquo;s say, or i the conflation of the idea of intellectual prowess with merit maybe? Is that? Is that not as contentious an issue in general, in the u k thon
Speaker 1
we have a los of the currents that you have in the united states, but in a sort of weaker way, as a sort of echo a chamber in the united states. But we still have a memory, i think, of the meritocracy as being something that was progressive and something that was a cultural memory of the meritoas being something thatas progressive and something that displaced the old aristocratic alite. And i think both the new tories and the old labor people can agree that, you now the old aristocratic alet, there&rsquo;s something wrong with them. So we have, we have a, a better memory of the failures of a premer cratic society than you do in the united states, i think, asad i think the situation in the united states is strange, because one of the things that were were better at at the moment in britain is a, i think, promoting social (

i saw that often an in n in my students who were of the radical left persuasion, at elite institutions like harvard. Seems a bit much to ask for aright, to be a victim and an oppressor at the same time. I mean, whatwand i think one of mi worries about abandoning the the meritocratic principle.

well, i saw that often an in n in my students who were of the radical left persuasion, at elite institutions like harvard, where i was there for seven years as a professor, and then less so at the university of toronto. But it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a less elite and plutocratic institution by a large margin. But it always grated on me to some degree, because i thought, well, here you are at that, this institution, and so you are, by definition, already a member of the class of oppressors that you hypothetically despise. And the fact that you are here and accepted this and going through this means that you&rsquo;ve accepted it, and now you want to be on the side of the oppressed, and you want to have all the advantages of the hypothetical oppressor simultaneously. Seems a bit much to ask for aright, to be a victim and an oppressor at the same time. But i

think we shall always start with with the question of, what are you personally willing to give up? But, but, but still. I mean, whatwand i think one of mi worries about abandoning the the meritocratic (

Summary:
There is no evidence that group membership produces diversity of the sort that would actually broaden the human scope of any discussion. And there is not a lot of racial difference in temperament. We know there are other sources of variability. There&rsquo;s variability in temperament, five dimensions. It emerged out of pure brute force statistics. That&rsquo;s where the diver city lies. But i don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a biased finding in it it was, it was agnostic theoretically.

Thats, yes, there&rsquo;s no evidence for that. That&rsquo;s wrong, technically wrong? Well, it&rsquo;s partly wrong because, look, we could talk about want ed. One of the arguments you lay out in your book that certain psychologists, and they tend to be educational psychologists, have levied against, ah, strict maritocrotic tests like those that are fundamentally ic tests. So that would be the s a t, the g ore all everything that&rsquo;s used for for entrance into undergraduate universities, where that&rsquo;s used in graduate school, professional schools, that&rsquo;sall ic testing, essentially. And people will say it&rsquo;s not, but that&rsquo;s cause they don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re talking about. I casso. Then you might say, well, ice&rsquo;s pretty singular and&rsquo;s pretty good predictor of long term success in a cognitively complex society. But there are other sources of variance, possibly. So you get thinkers like robert sternberg, for example, who talked about practical intelligence, and a the multiple intelligence theorist, howard gardiner, and both of whose scientific work i think is shoddy, beyond beyond comprehension, and a terrible answer to a problem that&rsquo;s been answered actually quite nicelysc ally. We know there are other sources of variability. There&rsquo;s variability in temperament, five dimensions. That&rsquo;s a lot, five dimensions. And i don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a biased finding in it it was, it was agnostic theoretically. It emerged out of pure brute force statistics. That&rsquo;s where the diver city lies. And there is not a lot of racial difference in temperament. So the idea that group membership produces diversity of a sort that would actually broaden the human scope of any discussion, any corporation, et cetera, et cetera, is just wrong. There is no evidence for it. Whatever. It&rsquo;s even worse than that, because it makes the presumption that the essential source of diversity is, in fact, ethnicity in race. And that can go wrong very badly. (
