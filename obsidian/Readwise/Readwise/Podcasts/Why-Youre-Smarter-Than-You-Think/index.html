Speaker 3: I just remember being taunted and being you know told things like like oh you&rsquo;re too stupid to go in the fourth grade, you idiot like that, that sort of thing. Um but yeah, it was really, it was really
Speaker 2: painful
Speaker 0: this week on Hidden Brain. Many of us have knee jerk conclusions about what intelligence is and how it can be measured. We think we know what intelligence is.
Speaker 1: But do we really,
Speaker 3: it almost instantly seduced me into loving the science of I. Q. Intelligence and I forgot that I was supposed to be on this vendetta. I (

It really wasn&rsquo;t because I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute there, there there&rsquo;s a whole different class of humans, that&rsquo;s the direct opposite of what I am and they&rsquo;re the they&rsquo;re the gifted ones and suddenly it was like a I&rsquo;m stuck in the complete opposite world.
Speaker 0: It felt awful.
Speaker 3: One way, it felt awful was that the expectation carried me around from class to class to class, even some of the more mainstream classes I was starting to be put into in middle school, I remember being in a mainstream class and on the first day of class I saw this girl who had such a crush on, oh my gosh, I was way too shy to ever say anything to her, but I saw her all around. (

Speaker 0: And it&rsquo;s almost like this this one this one teacher in this one moment, it was almost like a lightbulb going off in your head. It sounds like
Speaker 3: it wasn&rsquo;t like a white bulb, it was like volcano erupting a volcano of human potential that had been dormant.
Speaker 0: one day he was hanging out with friends after school
Speaker 3: and they said, hey we have to just go to the choir room and pick up something and this was after class after school after school. And so I just walked, went with them and they were in the choir room and the choir conductor was there and I remember just sort of like making fun of them. Like I was like, you know, you (

He turned the test into a tracking tool to identify the gifted
Speaker 3: Terman was very very interested in giftedness and really had this idea in his head that genius is only recruited from the line of high IQ. There&rsquo;s a lot of people involved in these early days of of applying I. Q. Test. It&rsquo;s really application here. We&rsquo;re talking about using it to sort people in America that betrayed the original philosophy. Uh They made into multiple choice tests and gave gave it out to (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/62aa015b62ce94f7a9b2bfea rel=noopener>Time¬†0:31:06</a>)<ul><li>Note: The Americans betrayed Binet by using tests for intelligence.</li></ul></li><li>Speaker 0: and spatial skills were just that skills that could be learned with practice. Wasn&rsquo;t it odd that the kids who were good at one were often also good at the other. Scott found himself intrigued by questions like this.
Speaker 3: My curiosity just took over you know and I and I started actually doing really traditional serious experimental research with him when I got there to Cambridge,
Speaker 0: there was a second area when Nick McIntyre started to sway scott&rsquo;s pre existing views about I. Q. Tests,
Speaker 3: something that that I found fascinating. And I started to go to nick McIntosh&rsquo;s lectures. Um he did present data showing the correlation between IQ and lots of outcomes in life. (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/62aa67ee62ce94f7a9c3b189 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:35:44</a>)<ul><li>Note: How do kids who are good at spatial skills are often also good at verbal skills, and vice versa?</li></ul></li><li>Speaker 0: the controlled forms of thinking. What is this leave out scott.
Speaker 3: Absolutely. Well one specific thing I did study in my dissertation is this idea called implicit learning which is our ability to learn the probabilistic rural structure of the world automatically and implicitly without our level of awareness. This is deep implications. I mean so you talk about the theme of your show right here we&rsquo;re getting to this is very very congruent. I mean think about what is required to develop social intelligence. Sometimes when people smile they mean this sometimes they don&rsquo;t sometimes when people&rsquo;s eyes are like this sometimes they don&rsquo;t you know the world is messy. And um I from a cognitive (

And uh we have found that virtually un correlated wholly un correlated with I. Q. Um The people that can go into an I. Q. Testing one of our sessions like a C. B. D. And get like extremely off the charts. I. Q. Um Often times the ones that are not learning. Um implicitly
Speaker 0: solving puzzles involves logic and analysis. But logic cannot help you read someone&rsquo;s expression in a crowded room that requires cognitive skills that are often learned unconsciously. Scott is not merely saying that the cognitive ability that I. Q. Test measure is different than (

So I socked him in the face. what do I do? And um with a lot of trepidation and my heart beating very fast. I approached him on the park bench and I said hey do you mind if I if I just sit next to you for a second I wanna tell you something? And he&rsquo;s like sure no problem no problem. And I sat down and said hey I was I was a student of yours and you you changed my life. Um And uh and he said (
