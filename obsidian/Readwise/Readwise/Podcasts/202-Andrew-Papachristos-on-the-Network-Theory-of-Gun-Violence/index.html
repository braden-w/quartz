Summary:
akie: I think a lot of us recognize that america is an outlier when it comes to gun violence in various ways. We have more guns in this country than people, which is not to say those guns are evenly distributed oss households. There&rsquo;s also something uniquely American about the idea of arming ourselves to protect ourselves. The tricky science part is, actually owning and carrying guns makes you less safe.

Well, youe mentioned already the fact that there is something uniquely american about this, akie, let&rsquo;s try to quantify that. S i think a lot of us recognize that america is an outlier when it comes to gun violence in various ways. So as that, are we right about that, and how much is it and why is that true? Simple questions, simple questions. So clearly,
Speaker 1
you know, the united states is not unique relative to, say, other european countries when it comes to things like robbery or non gun assaults. We are are unique when it comes to our gun homicide and gun assault levels of violence, which are, you know, tens of times higher than some of our other peers, or who we consider to be our peers. Part of this, of course, is the presence of firearms. We have more guns in this country than people. Which is not to say those guns are evenly distributed oss households. They are not. Most people that own a gun own multiple guns, which is, again, not uncommon. Of people that are into something, right? Some people are into shoes and sneakers and cars, and some people are into guns for whatever reason. So there&rsquo;s a unique, unique part of this country, that is about, you know, owning a gunit is a constitution, al right, and is being upheld by the supreme court. There&rsquo;s also something uniquely american about the idea of arming ourselves to protect ourselves. So that number one reasond people carry your own firearm in this country as for protection. And the sort of, the tricky science part is, actually owning and carrying guns actually makes you less safe. So despite that, this idea that guns will keep us safe is pervasive. And it doesn&rsquo;t matter, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you live in the suburbs, doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you live in a neighborhood that is experiencing a disproportiondamount of gun (

Summary:
It&rsquo;s important to distinguish at least three of these types. One is intimate partner violence, the other two are mass shootings and gun homicides. Intimate partner violence happens behind closed doors, so we often don&rsquo;t hear about it. Largest volume of gun homicides occurs in public places like shopping malls or schools.

Speaker 1
But when it comes to homicides, which we have better data on, not perfect data, you know, there are different types and, and, you know, it&rsquo;s important to distinguish at least three of these types. One one is, of course, our course, mass shootings, spree shootings, the kinds we see that are going around the country, again, right now. And you know, as we&rsquo;re seeing an infant shopping malls and schools a and theirs are quite distinct from other two real types. One is intimate partner violencewhich is, again, extremely serious, but very different sort than the third, which is the lion&rsquo;s share of gun homicides, which is essentially assault, assaults, people that know each other, arguments, disputes. And that&rsquo;s commonly, that&rsquo;s kind of what shows up on the front page more often than not. And part of the reason it gets more attention, besides its the volume, the largest volume of gun homicides, is oftentimes it&rsquo;s public, right? Intimate partner violence happens behind closed doors, so we often don&rsquo;t hear about it. We don&rsquo;t know a lot about (
<a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/9332c6e3-1441-48be-962d-4def7ee60b13 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:11:23</a>)</li><li>2/3 Of Gun Violence is between people who know each other
Summary:
The majority of gun micides are these assault of interactions, essentially. It sounds like usually, if it&rsquo;s not a man, shooting is by some one whom they know or have some connection with in some more abstract way. Two thirds that we know of are by people that are known to the person who was injured or killed. And the other third we actually just don&rsquo;t know. A siwes don&rsquo;t know who did it. Ah, and by the way, your enemy is often not a stranger. The person whom you got into fight with is oftenNot a stranger. They only is not of the non-to neighborhood, from your class, from work, from the pub.
Transcript:
Speaker 2
So you said, you seemed to say man mentioning assault of violence against people who you know, or in a rival gang, or something like that. I does that category also include if someone robs a bank and it goes terribly wrong and they kill somebody? Ye
Speaker 1
would. It would actually include them. That happens much more rarely then wit former, of course, a, you know, the could be even a thirda fourth category of state violence, especially those shot by police. And then again, of course, you branch off into, was it the commission of a crime? You know, was it a traffic stop? Was it a mistaken identity? Was it intentional a but in that case, again, those are smaller portions of the total. The majority of gun micides are these assault of interactions, essentially. So imean, so that already tells us something thata, when there is going to be and an assault of homicide,
Speaker 2
or rather, let&rsquo;s us broaden it, when some one is killed with a gun by another person. It sounds like usually, if it&rsquo;s not a man, shooting is by some one whom they know or have some connection with in some more abstract way. That&rsquo;s
Speaker 1
right. I mean, so this idea of stranger homicide is is actually quite rare. Two thirds that we know of are by people that are known to the person who was injured or killed. And the other third we actually just don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s not that that other third ar strangers. A siwes don&rsquo;t know who did it. Ah, and by the way, your enemy is often not a stranger. The person whom you got into fight with is often not a stranger. They only is not of the non to neighborhood, from your class, from work, from the pub. Athe. They are not unknown. You know them. Might not like them, which is different then then stranger. Because, you know, when we read about this in the media, of course, the fear that is stoked is that if it could happen to anybody, it could happen anywhere. (

Summary:
Two thirds that we know of are by people that are known to the person who was injured or killed. The other third we actually just don&rsquo;t know. Most of this viol is happening in social networks, in small communities that people are known to each other. And nw, i think it&rsquo;s important that we understand that they&rsquo;re all tragic, but they&rsquo;re not qite rand, of course.

Because, you know, when we read about this in the media, of course, the fear that is stoked is that if it could happen to anybody, it could happen anywhere. There are stray bullet killings that are, you know, accidentally kills somebody. But that that is, again, not the norm. Most of this viol is happening in social networks, in small communities that people are known to each other. And nw, i think it&rsquo;s important that we understand that they&rsquo;re all tragic, but they&rsquo;re not qite rand, of course. And i think that helps us understand solutions as well. I mean, just to get on the table the idea, i think that
Speaker 2
exactly, because this is such a hot button issue and such an emotional issue, some people will be upset when you talk about certain types of gun violence and not others, right? Or youknw, you&rsquo;re choosing to focus on something. And i&rsquo;ll just go on the record of saying that i would like to understand it all so that we can diminish the rate of all of it, no matter what kind of gun violence it is.
Speaker 1
Yes, yes, i think that&rsquo;s fair. I thinkthe the only reason it&rsquo;s important to unpack it is the the treatment, if you will, or the response, is not necessarily the same, exactly, you know. (

And the other third we actually just don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s not that that other third ar strangers. A siwes don&rsquo;t know who did it. Ah, and by the way, your enemy is often not a stranger. The person whom you got into fight with is often not a stranger. They only is not of the non to neighborhood, from your class, from work, from the pub. (

Summary:
In communities that have high levels of gun violence, generally the victims and potential perpetrators are in a network of a couple hundred peoplerit. Depending on the city or neighborhood, a couple thousand people. In our study of boston, 85 % of all fatal, non-fatal shootings happened in anetwork of 700 people. And it turns out, what we ndin chicago in general, but during this three weeks period, was that your probability of being a victim is directly related to how many people around you are getting shot.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
And here we&rsquo;ve studied chicago and boston and oakland and new york and newark and cincinnati and new orleans and even evanston, which is where northwestern lives. And we&rsquo;ve noticed a pattern that is consistent, which is gun violence concentrates in very, very small social networks. Even in communities that have high levels of gun violence or experience high levels of gun violence, generally, the victims and potential perpetrators of shooting are in a network of a couple hundred peoplerit, or, depending on the city or neighborhood, a couple thousand people. So in our study of boston, 85 % of all fatal, non fatal shootings happened in a network of 700 people, less than four % of this community&rsquo;s population. And in chicago, when we did the whole city of chicago, again, less than four %, about 75 % of the fatal and non fatal shootings. And when i&rsquo;m talking about networks here, i&rsquo;m talking about instances where people were either engaging in a crime together, or arrested together, or were co involved in an event that elicited some system response. But we can think of it broadly as the people you hang out with a the people that hang out with that would have your back in a fight, am ar, tend to be your network. And it turns out, what we ndin chicago in general, but during this three weeks period, was that your probability of being a victim is directly related to how many people around you are getting shot. So if your friends, if you&rsquo;re in parts of a network where victimizations are happening, your probability sky rockets. (

Summary:
There are more guns in chicago than there are in new york or la. Part of that is not necessarily the city&rsquo;s gun laws or the states, but our proximity to states like indiana,. The continued dominance of a a political machine system keeps crime in some neighborhoods and not in other neighborhoods. And the last thing, which is so important inChicagoland: A lack of im using the word reform broadly, but like, change in policing in this city.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
However, you know, to answer your question, chicago, i would say, to day, the best comparison would be los angeles in the 19 nineties. You know, some of the things that keep ago&rsquo;s homicide rate higher than its peers, and it often gets kits compared to chi a, new york and ele a has to do wih with the levels and the size of the city. What keeps chicago unique? A, one of the things, outside of segregation, racest housing policies and all the things that kind of cre neighborhoods that have high crime rates and keepin that way, is its history of gangs in this city, which is um fundamentally different than some of those other cities. L a had a similar history, as did new york, but their gangs didn&rsquo;t, a, grow as big and as pervasive as chicagos in terms of the level of organization and polit politicaliation. And that still lingers to this day, am guns. Chicago recovers more guns. There are more guns in chicago than there are in new york or la. And part of that is a, not necessarily the city&rsquo;s gun laws or the states, but our proximity to states like indiana, which is where a second largest source of guns come from, which is, is largely a cash and carry state. And the two other ones, which are really important, and there are others, one is the continued dominance of a a political machine system, which is slowly changed over time, but, you know, that&rsquo;s part of what keeps crime in some neighborhoods and not in other neighborhoods. It creates the boundaries, you know, almost criminological jerry mandering. Ah, you know, in a sense where, i&rsquo;m going to actually write that one down in us. Gi like, but it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s pretty much what you have, like, if you&rsquo;rea powerful ward boss, you can get services, cops will come, you know, they will do sweeps and serve warrants. And the last thing, which is so important in chicago is, of course, the utter lack of im using the word reform broadly, but like, change in policing in this city. So i point to l a because l a had similar gangs to chicago in the nineties. Qorrific scandals in (

right. I just want, i to reiterate again, you know, if there there are 900 crews in chicago, there are probably a handful that are actively involved in some organized stuff. And every year, every other year, you&rsquo;ll see a big federal case from the us. Attorney&rsquo;s office. (

Summary:
There are 900 crews in chicago, there are probably a handful that are actively involved in some organized stuff. And so the danger when it comes to policy, is that you treat those 895 or 885 as if they were alcapon, right? Or the gangster disciples of the nineties, or whatever the case might be. Most groups are these sort of side corner groups. The history is there, and it&rsquo;s tied to a very specific place that&rsquo;s been segregated and locked up and locked out for generations.

Speaker 1
right. I just want, i to reiterate again, you know, if there there are 900 crews in chicago, there are probably a handful that are actively involved in some organized stuff. And every year, every other year, you&rsquo;ll see a big federal case from the us. Attorney&rsquo;s office. Those four or five groups that are involved in that should be treated, you know, that way, figure out the activities. But that means, you know, 895 of them are not. And so the danger when it comes to policy, is that you treat those 895 or 885 as if they were alcapon, right? Or the gangster disciples of the nineties, or whatever the case might be. And they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re just not. And that is, that&rsquo;s the slippery slope with gang policies. Gangs become, you know, a catch all for everything bad and evil in the bugy man. And in reality, most are as you described, a crew of people on the block who are protecting themselves and their friends, and, by the way, you know, sometimes avenging them. And that cre problems that need resolution, for sure. But, um, you know, i think again, i think our us. Attorney&rsquo;s office in illinois makes these big cases cause they can&rsquo;t, cause it&rsquo;s happening. But we have to remember that most groups are not that. Most groups are these sort of side corner groups. And and some of them are a little bit bigger, but they&rsquo;re all and they atet. The history is there, and it&rsquo;s tied to a very specific place that&rsquo;s been segregated and locked up and locked out for generations.

Other than just fort of mutual protection or even just socializing, are the gangs also involved in a, the drug trade, or petty crimes, or protection rackets, an like (

Summary:
I&rsquo;m kind of intrigued by the roll of social media here, which id never really thought of. I don&rsquo;t know anybody between 14 and, say, 26 who&rsquo;s not on social media. It&rsquo;s just part of what we do as a society. What happening on social media is people are using it to taunt rivals, to disrespect rivals, to honor their friends. To express grief deeply in ways that are hard to do in other spaces. All that&rsquo;s playing out on line.

I&rsquo;m

kind of intrigued by the roll of social media here, which id never really thought of. Like, are the, are the gangs insulting each other on twitter, or how is this working?

M so i&rsquo;m going,
Speaker 1
i have to to defer to some of my great colleagues, forrest stewart at stamford, desmond patten at columbia and a geffrey lane at rudkers. You know, it&rsquo;s complicated. So first of all, i don&rsquo;t know anybody between 14 and, say, 26 who&rsquo;s not on social media. So so it&rsquo;s important to distinguish this is just normal behavior being on social media, connecting, you know, ribbing people, trolling people. It&rsquo;s not necessarily nice behavior, trolling people, but it&rsquo;s just part of, i&rsquo;ve teenaters myself, right? It&rsquo;s just part of, you know, what we do as a society. What happening on social media is people are using it to, you know, taunt rivals, to disrespect rivals, to honor their friends, as one of s, one of ourr colleagues, desmon pan, talks about, to express grief deeply in ways that are hard to do in other spaces.

Or record hearings around, you know, az osborne or n w a. I guess this is just the latest way of things kind of getting out there. But the speed with which it happens is quite different,.

Part
Speaker 2
of me wants to say that we should, you know, try to replace actual fights with guns on the streets, with fights in a world of warcraft or something like that. But i figure probably, like your implying, maybe, that if they did that, they would just spill over into the streets anyway, thing that&rsquo;s not the right thing to do. But well,
Speaker 1
again, i think we just need to take stock of where we are as society. This is new, right? We used to the 19 forties, there were entire senatorial hearings on micky mouse and comic books and mad magazine, because it was a new form of media. Or record hearings around, you know, az osborne or n w a. I guess is a common theme. This is just the latest way of things kind of getting out there. But the speed with which it happens is quite different, of course, cause it&rsquo;s immediate, and it can kind of, you know, doest things, don&rsquo;t get to calm down as much, and you mention a little bit. But i wanted to
Speaker 2
focus it on, just for a second, the role of the police in this am it can be for better, for worse, i imagine a do you think there&rsquo;s an issue where police are just sort of ignoring certain neighborhoods, letting things go? Or is itt there&rsquo;s a strategy that is just ill suited to the circumstances in these ertain neighborhoods. (

Summary:
The networks are created through ances of coarest or being stopped together by the police. So it is actually setting aside anything around culpability. It&rsquo;s an observation made by police a point in time and space. M, i focus mainly on victims. One, because in chicago we have abysmally low clearance rates. But more to the point, violence prevention is about saving lives.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
So great questions. So when i&rsquo;m talking the networks are created through ances of coarest or being stopped together by the police. So it is actually setting aside anything around culpability. It&rsquo;s an observation made by police a point in time and space. Um, you know, there are biases in police data which are important. We&rsquo;re able to see a lot of those. So, say, failure to comply, often is something that&rsquo;s officer base. Robbery, assault, arson, things like that, tend to be come to the attention of police from civilians. So we take all those things to account. But basically, if you and i somebody together, we have a tie. And then if i, you know, committ an assault with somebody else, we have a tie. And you string these things together, and it creates actually, a network of of a risky behaviors, right? Things that are inherently you and i engaging in a behavior that could be risky. So, but your comment about victim and suspect, or people that are involved. M, i focus mainly on victims. One, because in chicago we have abysmally low clearance rates. But more to the point, violence prevention is about saving lives. And focusing on ho&rsquo;s in harm&rsquo;s way, who is experiencing trama, is the kind of most immediately actionable information. And we generally have all the information about who was injured. And from a public health standpoint, it shouldn&rsquo;t matter whether you have a felany conviction, or, you know, our bad parent, or you dropped out o none of that should matter if you&rsquo;re focusing on saving somebody&rsquo;s life.

We&rsquo;re using publicly available arrest records. We don&rsquo;t even have to foi them, but you could. Am, no, it&rsquo;s just a matter of looking at them slightly differently.

So
Speaker 1
normi to be clear, and also to be clear, we&rsquo;re using publicly available arrest records. So we&rsquo;re using c c t v license plates, readers, um, you know, all those things are a totally different level. Again, going to w rely on basically public data. You know, you can go to your court and get arrest records. We&rsquo;re just looking at the digital versions of those, which, again, in most cases, are available a. We don&rsquo;t even have to foi them, but you could. Am, no, it&rsquo;s just a matter of looking at them slightly differently. You know, of course, the surveillance state in that way is also goes horribly wrong. I know you are teasing, wern. We&rsquo;re on tape

here. I want to make sure, sbettere not, you have wae, what we&rsquo;re doing and what we&rsquo;re not doing. You&rsquo;re not allowed to joke on the podcast without immediately saying that was a joke, otherwise people will take it out of content. S. That&rsquo;s absolutely true. But that does a bring up, you know, the prospect of perhaps, or maybe it&rsquo;s already happening, collaborating with either police departments or healt agencies, or something like that. You sayth you just use publicly available data, but are there further prospective investigations in the future where you use other kind of data sets?
Speaker 3
So you name two.
Speaker 1
So short answer, as there&rsquo;s lots of potential uses for the science, but you name two agencies that use them very differently. You mention the police and public health entities. There&rsquo;s a third one, which i&rsquo;m working with, which are community base entities. U police have used these technologies and sort of approaches, and it hasn&rsquo;t gone extremely well. And it hasn&rsquo;t gone extremely well because they&rsquo;ve done, typically what police do, they get some print out, they make a list, and they do what cops do, which is they work a listand whoever&rsquo;s on the top of the list is number one, and whosever number two is number two.

Speaker 1
Let me also just say, when you talk about we all live in these worlds, right? And we all know a lot about our own small world. And so when you bring these images, say, to street outreach work s or teachers, my sister&rsquo;s a teacher, we often talk about like, wa tilas li, tell me what&rsquo;s going on in your school, she starts describing. Am i see network images? So if you have that image, if you have the road map, the whole road map, and you have experts that can be like, let me tell you about this network. Only say, you and i, you know, robbed somebody together. But then simers think, n let me tell you. Jahn and andy played football together, and john used to date andy&rsquo;s sister, and then they broke up, and then he hung out. All of a sudden the context becomes important. And you only get that by engaging local experts, good preachers, teachers, cops, outreach workers, social workers. They know a community, or they should know a community. That&rsquo;s what makes this information actionable. And that&rsquo;s what didn&rsquo;t happen in some bofthye&rsquo;s instances. Like, if you&rsquo;re just working a list, you don&rsquo;t care whether shawn&rsquo;s already got a job and turned his life around. He&rsquo;s on the list. Like, right? What similarities are we seeing in these networks? What are we seeing? To answer your other question, one, they&rsquo;re super small and they&rsquo;re super concentrated. So even when you think of a neighborhood that&rsquo;s disproportionately impacted by gun violence, with, say, forty thousand people, this network has a couple of hundred people in it. Its small. It&rsquo;s also not secret. That&rsquo;s the other (

We are smart enough as humans to be able to figure out what individuals who are in, say, a small network need. You ask them actually, or you ask people who know them. Heh. There are these 20 folks, you know, in your inyer neighbourhood, what do you know and what do they need? And then you can kind of direct accordingly. It can&rsquo;t just be, everybody needs to do these three things, go. It has to be like, what are what are we learning about problem? It might not involve groups or gangs. It might be family dispute. It might be intimate partner violence. It&rsquo;s important to know that. And every neighborhoods a little different. You know, in chicago, latino communities have a very different sort of gang present still, then black communities, right? They&rsquo;re just their different groups. Can&rsquo;t do that. You can&rsquo;t cut and paste. You got to understand the contexts. You know. Conversely, black communities don&rsquo;t have to fear ice the way latino communities did, especially under trum, right? There was a clear, you know, fear that rose during that, during those four years that changed the dynamic of people talking to people.

Summary:
Is there a broader stratum just to warn people or help them lower their chances of being part of this cycle of violence? Well, that&rsquo;s a good question, i think, for folks have been in, you knowo shout out to other first responses in this space. Am, when you are in a hospital room after shooting, it is microcosm of the neighborhood and the dispute in many cases.
Transcript:
Speaker 2
Let me to try to distinguish between what seems natural and obvious to me, which is that literally, the family members that go to the hospital with the shooting victim deserve some a care and and a attention to to help them get over this drama. But then, are you suggesting that there are people that you can identify as being in the network with that victim, even though the don&rsquo;t go to the hoss oh, even thigh, they weren&rsquo;t there? But is there a broader stratum just to warn people or or help them lower their chances of being part of this cycle of violence? Well,
Speaker 1
that&rsquo;s a good question, i think, for folks have been in, you knowo shout out to other first responses in this space. Am, when you are in a hospital room after shooting, it is microcosm of the neighborhood and the dispute in many cases. So not only of the victims and their family or somebody showing there, so are the police. Ah, oftentimes other people are injured as well. (
