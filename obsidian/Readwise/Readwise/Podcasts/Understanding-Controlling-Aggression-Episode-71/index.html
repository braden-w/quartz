Speaker 1: Today we are discussing aggression,
Speaker 0: I&rsquo;m
Speaker 1: going to explain to you that there are several different
Speaker 0: types of aggression.
Speaker 1: For instance reactive aggression
Speaker 0: versus proactive aggression meaning
Speaker 1: sometimes people will be aggressive because they feel threatened
Speaker 0: or they are
Speaker 1: protecting those that they love, who
Speaker 0: also feel threatened. There&rsquo;s also
Speaker 1: proactive aggression
Speaker 0: where people go out of their
Speaker 1: way to deliberately
Speaker 0: try and harm others
Speaker 1: and there is indirect aggression which is aggression not
Speaker 0: involving physical violence
Speaker 1: for instance shaming
Speaker 0: people and things of that sort,
Speaker 1: it turns out that there are different biological
Speaker 0: mechanisms
Speaker 1: underlying each of the different types of aggression
Speaker 0: and today I will define those for you. I&rsquo;ll talk about the neural circuits in the brain and body that
Speaker 1: mediate each of the different kinds of (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/627faac73782e70d240e1a9d rel=noopener>Time¬†0:00:12</a>)</li><li>Speaker 0: some of the hormones and
Speaker 1: peptides and neurotransmitters involved.
Speaker 0: I promise to make it all
Speaker 1: accessible to you, even if you do not
Speaker 0: have any biology or science background. I
Speaker 1: also discussed
Speaker 0: tools, psychological
Speaker 1: tools and biological tools that one can use to better
Speaker 0: control aggression.
Speaker 1: Now right here at the
Speaker 0: outset I want to acknowledge
Speaker 1: that any discussion about aggression has to
Speaker 0: have an element of context within it
Speaker 1: to be fair human beings invest
Speaker 0: a lot of money a lot of time and a lot of
Speaker 1: energy and indeed can even derive pleasure
Speaker 0: from aggression.
Speaker 1: Later I&rsquo;ll talk about neural circuits in the brain and
Speaker 0: body that
Speaker 1: reinforce, in other words, reward through the release of chemicals
Speaker 0: that make people feel good
Speaker 1: acts of (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/627faad93782e70d240e2780 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:00:58</a>)</li><li>Speaker 0: following him. He had a habit of
Speaker 1: geese adopting
Speaker 0: him because of the
Speaker 1: behaviors that he partook in. So he would swim out on a lake in front of a bunch of little geese and then they would think
Speaker 0: that he was the parent and they would imprint on him.
Speaker 1: He even lived with these
Speaker 0: animals and they lived with him, sort of a strange character from what I hear.
Speaker 1: But nonetheless,
Speaker 0: all this work was deserving of the Nobel
Speaker 1: prize because what he discovered were fixed action
Speaker 0: patterns that
Speaker 1: is patterns of behavior that could be evoked by a single
Speaker 0: stimulus. Okay,
Speaker 1: this is really important. The idea that you can get a whole category
Speaker 0: of behaviors like
Speaker 1: swimming behind a parent or looking to
Speaker 0: somebody for comfort and
Speaker 1: only them. The idea that you could get a huge category of different behaviors in a bunch of different (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/627fab723782e70d240e806b rel=noopener>Time¬†0:11:45</a>)</li><li>Speaker 0: logical
Speaker 1: intent and
Speaker 0: purpose. He wasn&rsquo;t just poking around in there for fun. He was
Speaker 1: trying to identify brain regions that could generate entire
Speaker 0: categories of behavior. Allah
Speaker 1: Lawrence
Speaker 0: wright! These fixed action pattern behaviors.
Speaker 1: Eventually his electrode landed in a site and he provided
Speaker 0: electrical stimulation to the cat
Speaker 1: that caused this otherwise passive
Speaker 0: purring,
Speaker 1: relaxing cat to suddenly go into an absolute
Speaker 0: rage. So
Speaker 1: arched, back hissing hair
Speaker 0: up, so called pilo
Speaker 1: erection. Where the hairs go up.
Speaker 0: Animals try to make themselves as big as possible often
Speaker 1: when they are aggressive drooling, maybe even spitting.
Speaker 0: Believe it or not, (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/627fabfb3782e70d240edde1 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:17:42</a>)</li><li>Speaker 0: the experimenters call it
Speaker 1: and then afterwards
Speaker 0: that he will dismount.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they observed this kind of mounting and
Speaker 0: and sex behavior
Speaker 1: is very typical. But about halfway through
Speaker 0: the behavior
Speaker 1: day you turned on the light to stimulate these estrogen receptor contain neurons only in the
Speaker 0: male mouse. And
Speaker 1: what she observed was incredibly
Speaker 0: dramatic.
Speaker 1: The male mouse ceases from trying to mate with the female mouse and immediately tries
Speaker 0: to kill the female mouse.
Speaker 1: He starts attacking her. Then she turns off the light, the mail stops and goes
Speaker 0: back to trying to mate with the female mouse. I&rsquo;m sure all of this was very confusing
Speaker 1: and disturbing
Speaker 0: to the female mouse. Nonetheless, that was the repertoire
Speaker 1: they would meet. She would stimulate these (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/627fae3d3782e70d24107272 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:28:06</a>)</li><li>Speaker 1: alone, but with a rubber glove filled with
Speaker 0: air water mouse walking
Speaker 1: around sniffing peeing,
Speaker 0: which is what male mice seem to do. They seem to urinate everywhere.
Speaker 1: Especially an interesting,
Speaker 0: perhaps interesting feature of male mice and actually
Speaker 1: many male animals,
Speaker 0: perhaps even humans, we don&rsquo;t know or maybe we do
Speaker 1: know basically
Speaker 0: there&rsquo;s been observed time and time again in experiments
Speaker 1: mainly by lisa&rsquo;s
Speaker 0: towers lab at the Scripps Institute is characterized
Speaker 1: this if you put female mice into an arena or a cage, they always urinate in a very small
Speaker 0: corner of that cage.
Speaker 1: Whereas if you put male mice into
Speaker 0: an arena or a
Speaker 1: cage that urinate
Speaker 0: everywhere. They have this kind of obsession with spraying their urine everywhere. You can um sort of transpose that to human behavior if you like.
Speaker 1: In any event. (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/627fae633782e70d241081fd rel=noopener>Time¬†0:29:46</a>)</li><li>Speaker 0: although I do remember your name, I&rsquo;m not gonna tell you what his name was.
Speaker 1: A kid jumped on my back and bit
Speaker 0: me on the top of my back
Speaker 1: and this of course resulted in a discussion and in
Speaker 0: a time out and all the usual things and parents I think got involved. I don&rsquo;t recall,
Speaker 1: I didn&rsquo;t think much
Speaker 0: else of it, but
Speaker 1: I recall that this was considered especially troubling behavior because he bit me as opposed to hit me or shoved
Speaker 0: me down or something that sort
Speaker 1: and it does seem as if the tendency to use biting as an aggressive
Speaker 0: behavior
Speaker 1: is associated with a more
Speaker 0: primitive circuitry. Now,
Speaker 1: here I&rsquo;m truly
Speaker 0: anthropomorphizing. I don&rsquo;t know what this other kid happened to be thinking or feeling at the time. How could I?
Speaker 1: And I certainly
Speaker 0: am not going to say
Speaker 1: that biting in
Speaker 0: every case reflects (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/627faec53782e70d2410ca67 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:34:01</a>)</li><li>Speaker 1: In order to understand this, I just want to briefly refer back to
Speaker 0: a conversation that I had on a previous episode of the Huberman lab podcast and that was with my
Speaker 1: colleague, the great
Speaker 0: robert Sapolsky, of course is a professor at stanford who studied
Speaker 1: testosterone and
Speaker 0: its impacts on behavior
Speaker 1: as well as estrogen
Speaker 0: and other hormones and their impacts on behavior.
Speaker 1: To make a long story short and to dispel a still
Speaker 0: unfortunately very common
Speaker 1: myth. Testosterone does not increase
Speaker 0: aggressiveness.
Speaker 1: Testosterone increases pro activity and the willingness to lean into effort in competitive
Speaker 0: scenarios.
Speaker 1: Sometimes this is referred to as the challenge
Speaker 0: hypothesis but
Speaker 1: two make a long story short (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/627faf003782e70d2410f194 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:36:34</a>)</li><li>Speaker 0: lee that they naturally make,
Speaker 1: What you&rsquo;ll find is that testosterone tends to increase competitiveness, but not just in
Speaker 0: aggressive scenarios.
Speaker 1: So if somebody is already aggressive, giving them testosterone will have the tendency to
Speaker 0: make them more aggressive.
Speaker 1: If somebody, however, is very benevolent and altruistic giving them
Speaker 0: testosterone will make them more benevolent and
Speaker 1: altruistic, at least up to
Speaker 0: a point now, of course,
Speaker 1: there are certain forms of synthetic
Speaker 0: testosterone that are
Speaker 1: known in sports circles
Speaker 0: and in other circles
Speaker 1: to increase aggressiveness because of
Speaker 0: the way those particular forms
Speaker 1: of synthetic
Speaker 0: testosterone is work. But in
Speaker 1: general, most of the
Speaker 0: experiments that I&rsquo;m referring to have not been done using
Speaker 1: those, they&rsquo;ve been done
Speaker 0: using (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/627faf153782e70d2410fd2f rel=noopener>Time¬†0:37:27</a>)</li><li>Speaker 0: against Robert Sapolsky, who has been working on testosterone and its role in the brain and behavior for many decades now
Speaker 1: it is fair to say that testosterone has the net effect of making
Speaker 0: effort feel good
Speaker 1: or at least increasing the threshold at which effort feels
Speaker 0: bad or unsustainable. And
Speaker 1: it does that by way of changing the activity or the threshold
Speaker 0: for activation of brain structures like the
Speaker 1: amygdala and other brain
Speaker 0: structures associated with anxiety.
Speaker 1: So the next time somebody says testosterone makes people aggressive,
Speaker 0: you can say ah no, actually,
Speaker 1: it&rsquo;s estrogen
Speaker 0: that makes people
Speaker 1: aggressive and animals
Speaker 0: aggressive for that matter.
Speaker 1: Now, of course it is the case that because males
Speaker 0: have (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/627faf6b3782e70d24114057 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:41:13</a>)</li><li>Speaker 1: or to bias states
Speaker 0: of mind and body
Speaker 1: toward those that will lead to aggression. Again, aggression is not like a switch on and
Speaker 0: off. It&rsquo;s a process that has a
Speaker 1: beginning, a middle and an end. Remember that hydraulic pressure that
Speaker 0: konrad Lorenz hypothesized? Well,
Speaker 1: think of
Speaker 0: testosterone as
Speaker 1: increasing the pressure toward an aggressive
Speaker 0: episode and then
Speaker 1: estrogen actually triggering
Speaker 0: that aggressive episode in the venture medial hypothalamus. So
Speaker 1: if somebody tells you that
Speaker 0: testosterone endogenous or
Speaker 1: exogenous makes people aggressive,
Speaker 0: tell them no testosterone
Speaker 1: tends to make people lean into effort. And if that effort involves being aggressive
Speaker 0: either
