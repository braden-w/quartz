But like, like the sky mark fisher, who&rsquo;s dead now, had this idea about, like, the slow concellation of the future. I feel like that&rsquo; one of the most profound ideas that i&rsquo;ve come across in the last ten years of my life. And it seems so palpable that this is occurring that, you know, like, an example i will often use is, you know, if you take, say, ten minutes from an obscure film in 19 65, i look like no major actors, and then you take ten minutes from an obscure film from 19 80, where nobody became famous, and you show anyone these ten minute clips, they will have no problem what soever figuring out which one came first.

Summary:
i twind, i want to get away from seeing the past through the prism of the present. The nineties signal the end of when you were able to look at certain things, or certain qualities, and identify it as from that period. It&rsquo;s like it so easy to access the recent past that all sort of becomes pushed into the same sort of kind of gumbo, or whatever. And this phenomenon just seems to almost be infiltrating every aspect of the culture.

Oh,
Speaker 1
i mean, i think it&rsquo;s possible, very easy, in fact, to argue that the nineties were the last decade of the twentieth century, but also just the last decade that was sort of this immutable framing of time. One thing i talk about a little bit in the book, maybe i should have talked about more, but i twind, i want to get away from, you know, seeing the past through the prism of the present. But like, like the sky mark fisher, who&rsquo;s dead now, had this idea about, like, the slow concellation of the future. I feel like that&rsquo; one of the most profound ideas that i&rsquo;ve come across in the last ten years of my life. And it seems so palpable that this is occurring that, you know, like, an example i will often use is, you know, if you take, say, ten minutes from an obscure film in 19 65, i look like no major actors, and then you take ten minutes from an obscure film from 19 80, where nobody became famous, and you show anyone these ten minute clips, they will have no problem what soever figuring out which one came first. Even, like, a little kid couldn&rsquo;t look at a movie from 19 65 and a movie from 19 80 and instantly understand that one predates the other. But if you do that with a film from two thousand and five and a film from two thousand and 20, again, sort of an obscure film where you don&rsquo;t recognize the actors, you&rsquo;re just looking at it aesthetically, and trying to deduce which one came first and which one came second, it&rsquo;s almost impossible. And this phenomenon just seems to almost be infiltrating every aspect of the culture, this idea that everything, to a degree now, is somewhat retro and that certain kind of natural evolutions that happened because culture was lost or a sort of forgotten, or just kind of moved beyond which doesn&rsquo;t really happen now. It&rsquo;s like it so easy to access the recent past that all sort of becomes pushed into the same sort of kind of gumbo, or whatever. The nineties, to me, sort of signal the end of when you were able to look at certain things, or certain qualities, or a certain vague sense, and identify it as from that period. I fear that that may be over, although im not sure why i fear it. But
Speaker 2
why did it change? What happened? When did we sens the flip there? What o of that difference? Well,
Speaker 1
the answer, the easy answer, or the predictable answer, or the answer anyone would give, they would say, is the internet. (

Summary:
The internet emerges in the nineties. It&rsquo;s more like a real shallow ocean that&rsquo;s very easy to wade into and scoop up whatever you need. And it&rsquo;s vast, but it doesn&rsquo;t go deep. I mean, i used this example a lot. You know, when i worked in newspapers in the Nineties, there would always be people who could remember kind of cultural minutia that is gone now because everybody has a machine that does that. Instead of culture having depth, it&rsquo;s morelike areal shallow ocean that‚Äôs very easy toWade Into and scoop up what you need. That seems to be over now now that it&rsquo;s all so available.

Well,
Speaker 1
the answer, the easy answer, or the predictable answer, or the answer anyone would give, they would say, is the internet. That the internet emerges in the nineties. It makes kind of a big jump in 95, but it&rsquo;s still sort of, when you think of the internet in the nineties, that&rsquo;s really more of a mechanical discussion more than a cultural discussion. But then when you move beyond about two thousand and one, kind of beyond nine 11, and you see the introduction of social mediu and all these things, and just the ability that it is so easy for anyone to instantly access something like anything, something or anything. I mean, i used this example a lot. You know, it&rsquo;slike, when i worked in newspapers in the nineties, there would always be like, a person at that newspaper, maybe they had once been a reporter, now they&rsquo;re on the night desk or something. And you would go up to a person like that, and you&rsquo;d be like, hay, you know, i&rsquo;m trying to think of this movie, it&rsquo;s like, i don&rsquo;t know. It was like, about cars, and i think there&rsquo;s a beach boy in it, and i feel like the film burns up. And they&rsquo;d go, oh, that&rsquo;s too lane blacked out, like their job was to remember kind of cultural minutia that is gone now, because now everyone has the machine that does that. Which i guess may be personally disappointed, because it seemed like that was what my life was going to become, like the person who remembered all these sorts of insignificant things and sort of remembered what. But that seems to be over now now that it&rsquo;s all so available. Instead of culture having depth, it&rsquo;s more like a real shallow ocean that&rsquo;s very easy to wade into and scoop up whatever you need. And it&rsquo;s vast, but it doesn&rsquo;t go deep. (

Summary:
At the pro level, though, it will be difficult to see two teams that dynastic at the same time. The rivalry between like michigan and ohio state and auburn and alabama aren&rsquo;t going to go away. It kind of defies logic that the patriots have been able to succeed that way they have for 20 years. Doesn&rsquo;t really make sense, especially in the f l,. which is just, you know, designed to sort of allow every franchise to eventually get good.

have em at the collegiate level for sure, because you know, part of the reason i find myself drawn to college sports more than pro sports very often is that, even though the kind of person who goes to a school to play football or basketball is different than the student body, in a sense, if stanford is playing arizona, or if texas is playing georgia, there is a sense that, like, we have an understanding of what kind of person tends to go to those schools, and we can sort of apply it to the players. And even though the players might be outside of that kind of world, like, they kind of adopt those characteristics. So like the rivalry between like michigan and ohio state and auburn and alabama, those aren&rsquo;t going to go away. At the pro level, though, it will be difficult to see two teams that dynastic at the same time. Where, like the li and the celtics were clearly the two best teams in the league throughout that period. Yes, the sixers were good in there, the bucks were good in there. The rockets had success, but the sixers had to get moses malone in order to get over the hump to beat the celtics. And like when the rockets beat the lakers, it was an anomaly. So, like these two dynastic teams, thet were also completely different, even to just the most casual viewer. Race was rt of it, but also playing style, and also this understanding that, you know, they were on different coasts, and that there was something diametrically different about what it would be like to be a celtic fan and what would be like to be a laker fan. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that now, like, if you look at the annafel, the patriots have had sort of this dynasty over a long period of time, and teams have kind of come and gone. What would have needed to happen would have been like if the packers or the cowboys had had the same kind of success as the patriots over that same period of time. And that&rsquo;s almost impossible. Now, it kind of defies logic that the patriots have been able to succeed that the way they have for 20 years. Doesn&rsquo;t really make sense, especially in the f l, which is just, you know, designed to sort of allow every franchise to eventually get good, to create almost a inorganic degree of parody. (

Where, like the li and the celtics were clearly the two best teams in the league throughout that period. Yes, the sixers were good in there, the bucks were good in there. The rockets had success, but the sixers had to get moses malone in order to get over the hump to beat the celtics. And like when the rockets beat the lakers, it was an anomaly. So, like these two dynastic teams, thet were also completely different, even to just the most casual viewer. Race was rt of it, but also playing style, and also this understanding that, you know, they were on different coasts, and that there was something diametrically different about what it would be like to be a celtic fan and what would be like to be a laker fan. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that now, like, if you look at the annafel, the patriots have had sort of this dynasty over a long period of time, and teams have kind of come and gone. (

Speaker 1
Well, the first thing i will say is that when i think about sports experiences in my life, and i&rsquo;m discounting like, oh, you know, this team i wanted to win lost, or this team i hated succeeded, and i discount like terrible injuries to people, or like the death of lenbias, or whatever, when i think about things in sports that have disappointed me over the course of my life, the decline in college basket ball is probably at the top of the list. I would say that in the introduction of instant replayer the two things that disappoint me most about the way sports has changed over time. And you know, college basketball now is solely the march madness tournament. That seems to be the only thing even relatively serious college basketball fans care about. And because the best players play the shortest amount of time, it is real difficult to get a sense of what these guys are ike and and what the coach is trying to do beyond succeed. I guess that is part of it. Youtinkof college baske ball in the seventies and the eightiesnd you tink of liking old john wooden and bobby knight and dean smith and john thompson and all these guys, you think about these coaches who had consistently strong teams, and teams that had a real clear identity. Like you could look at these teams and you would almost see hen a kid graduates and a new kid is recruited, like he&rsquo;s the replacement for that guy, both as a position on the floor, but also as like, what they would bring to the team. And that is kind of gone now. I mean, it&rsquo;s like the fact that duke does this, i think people thought they might be like the last hold out of this, but they are not. (
