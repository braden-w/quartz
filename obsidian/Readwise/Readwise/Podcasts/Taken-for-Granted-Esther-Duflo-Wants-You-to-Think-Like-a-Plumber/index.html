And I&rsquo;m wondering if I gave up on economics too soon. Do you think I should have? I should have rethought my distaste for those equations.
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think you should have, but I understand why you didn&rsquo;t. And I think many, many students have exactly the same experience. I had the same experience and I had given up. It&rsquo;s only because I needed to make a little bit of money in Russia and because I uh I uh I thought it would be aware of being closer to what was happening that I got back in the proximity of economists. (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/6280f6003782e70d24f7f308 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:07:05</a>)</li><li>Speaker 1: it doesn&rsquo;t have the same meaning to me is when I actually meet the person face to face.
Speaker 0: So I tried this experiment or some version of this experiment in India in a different context. We had done some work on woman as policymakers. So in India they have a policy that force people to elect a woman every sound election. And uh this is randomly assigned. So you can compare the places that had a woman in places that didn&rsquo;t and we compare them in the in the next series of election. What we show is that a woman is more likely to, women are more likely to run and women are more likely to be elected if they had an experience of a woman as policymakers. So this is good since then we&rsquo;ve shown that this is (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/6280f6253782e70d24f7f639 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:27:26</a>)</li><li>Speaker 0: shocked at this process by just telling some people that women actually just as good as men. And so we did an experiment where we had just before an election. We had actors doing campaign on motivating electors in general. And in some version, they were showing the performance of women that were elected in other places and that had zero impact. So we came to the same conclusion that actually you have to do your experiences yourself. There is no substitute by someone trying to explain them to you. Perhaps for the reason you&rsquo;re saying that I think people quickly glaze over as soon as you&rsquo;re trying to kind of preach to them.
Speaker 1: I I think that it&rsquo;s totally fascinating. And I guess, you know, actually that was that was (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/6280f67e3782e70d24f7fbac rel=noopener>Time¬†0:28:22</a>)</li><li>Speaker 1: breaks the glass ceiling, it doesn&rsquo;t move people&rsquo;s attitudes over time.
Speaker 0: Well, what&rsquo;s interesting in this case is that the first woman that broke the glass ceiling, uh they were not brought in there by the voters will they were put in place there. So the blessing was broken from above with a big hammer, not from you know, 1000 paper cuts from below. And so in fact the voters hate the woman who is the first, the trailblazers. They are very negative impressions against them and those trailblazers have a miserable time and they don&rsquo;t run again. In fact, because I think people are quite resentful to be forced to have elected a woman. So it is interesting is that it&rsquo;s (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/6280f64b3782e70d24f7f820 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:29:45</a>)</li><li>Speaker 1: of prejudice, you can still improve people&rsquo;s perceptions of women&rsquo;s competence. It&rsquo;s also really depressing, right that even after acknowledging that women are just as competent at leadership as men, they still say I prefer not to have women in leadership roles.
Speaker 0: Yes, it&rsquo;s I find it more encouraging than depressing because I can accept the fact that you know, matches um is going to take some time to go away and in some sense, you know, I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m all for pragmatic as long as women can still sort of slowly make their way and show their competence and uh and and and make a difference then, you know, the fact that some grumpy men are not happy about it or even many compliments are not happy (
<a href=https://www.airr.io/quote/6280f66f3782e70d24f7fad0 rel=noopener>Time¬†0:31:30</a>)</li><li>Speaker 1: Right. Well, okay, I must be the kind of person who does that sort of thing and between wanting to rationalize their prior actions and actually learning something about who they are from seeing what they do. Sometimes behavior shifts. So I guess the concrete example that is if I go back to the fundraising callers, I was trying to study the mechanisms through which meeting a beneficiary of their work motivate them to work harder and more productively and I could not get any change in their attitudes. In my surveys, I was trying to test whether they reported their work being more meaningful. They felt more valued by, you know, by the scholarship students as opposed to devalued by the alumni donors who are screaming at them for interrupting their dinners and hanging up on them. And I just saw no movement. And some of that I think is it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s harder to measure fine grain changes in attitudes (
