Summary:
I missed having the system so much. I it&rsquo;s so much more tiring to drive without it. In atons o vehicles, to day waymo does not add value to people&rsquo;s lives. It&rsquo;s a more expensive flowo, slower uber. Maybe some day it&rsquo;ll be this big cliff where it adds.

value. Ad, ah, but also that that&rsquo;s all it is, and that
Speaker 1
not only, i find it a huge value. Ad, i drove down when we moved to san diego, i drove down in a enterprise renta car, and i missed it. I missed having the system so much. I it&rsquo;s so much more tiring to drive without it. It&rsquo;s, it is, that lane centring. That&rsquo;s the key feature. And in a way, it&rsquo;s the only feature that actually adds value to people&rsquo;s lives. In atons o vehicles, to day waymo does not add value to people&rsquo;s lives. It&rsquo;s a more expensive flowo, slower uber. Maybe some day it&rsquo;ll be this big cliff where it adds. I don&rsquo;t usually mean this fast. An, i haven&rsquo;t talked totha,
Speaker 3
this is good. I haven&rsquo;t. I have, intuitively, but i think we&rsquo;re making it explicit now. I i actually believe a that really good lane keeping, i&rsquo;s a reason to buy a car. Well, be a reason to buy a car, and is a huge value. Ad, i&rsquo;ve never, until we just started talking about it, haven&rsquo;t really quite realized it that i&rsquo;ve felt with elon&rsquo;s chase of level four is
Speaker 2
not the correct chase
Speaker 3
it was, cause
Speaker 4
you should just say, tesla has the best,
Speaker 2
as if from a tessa prorspective, say, tesla has the best lane keeping. (

Summary:
The most popular question is a, the trolley problem. We don&rsquo;t know how yet to detect the ethical dilemmast. So we&rsquo;re going to disengage and leave that decision to the human. You&rsquo;re such a troll? No, but the trolleyproblem deserves to be trolled. E ea, rigt, that&rsquo;s a beautiful answer, actually.

Speaker 2
So, something that&rsquo;s from a hacking perspective, this always comes up, especially with folks. Well, first, the most popular question is a, the
Speaker 3
trolley problem, right? So
Speaker 2
that&rsquo;s notsof serious a problem. There is some ethical questions. I think that they arise a,
Speaker 3
maybe
Speaker 1
you wod do youthink there&rsquo;s any ethical, serious ethical questions? Ev, we have a solution to the trolley problem. Come a. I well, so thers are actually an alert and our code ethical dilemma detected. It&rsquo;s not triggered yet. We don&rsquo;t, we don&rsquo;t know how yet to detect the ethical dilemmast. We&rsquo;re a level two system. So we&rsquo;re going to disengage and leave that decision to the human. You&rsquo;re
Speaker 4
such a troll? No, but the trolley problem deserves to be trolled. E ea, rigt, that&rsquo;s a beautiful answer, actually. I know i
Speaker 1
gave it to someone as like, sometimes people ask, like you asked about the trolley pro you can have a kind of discussion about it, like, boon, you get someone who&rsquo;s like, really, like, earnest about it. Because it&rsquo;s the kind of thing were, if you ask a bunch of people in an office whether we should use a sequel stack or no sequel stack, if they&rsquo;re not that technical, they have no opinion. But if you ask them what color they want to paint the office, everyone has an opinion on that. And
Speaker 4
that&rsquo;s why the trolley problem is a,
Speaker 2
i mean, that&rsquo;s a beautiful answer. Yet we&rsquo;re able to detect the problem, and we&rsquo;re
Speaker 3
able to pass it on to the humanwo, i&rsquo;ve never, never heard any more say it. Ndit a such a nice escape. Wert oka,
Speaker 4
by a proud level, too. (

how hard is it do you think to hack in a thomas vehicle, either through physical excess or through the more sort of popular nowd these adversarial examples on the censors,
Speaker 4
the adversarial examples. One, you want
Speaker 1
to see some adversarial examples that affect humans, right? Oh, well, there used to be a stop sign here, but i put a black bag over the stop sign, and then people ran it. Adversaria, right? Like, like, like, there&rsquo;s tons of human adversarial examples too. Om, question in general about, like, security. If you saw, i something, something just came out to day. And, like, there are always such hype headlines about, like, how navigateon auto pilot was fooled by a g p s spoof to take an exit. At least that&rsquo;s all they could do, was take an exit. If your car is relying on g p s in order to have a safe driving policy, you&rsquo;re doing something wrong if you&rsquo;re relying. And this is why v to v is such ate rable idea. Vta v now relies on both parties getting communication, right? This is not even, so, i think of a safety a security is like, a special case of safety. (
