They both consider each other friends, spending time together out of self-interest and the pleasure they derive from each other. However, while the two are friends through Aristotle&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;friendship of pleasure&rdquo;, they never disclose to each other, verbally or implicitly, that one considers the other a friend.

First are couples who agree about when to begin trying to become pregnant (about half of their sample). Then there are the couples who &ldquo;find themselves pregnant&rdquo; and decide to &ldquo;accept fate&rdquo; and go ahead (about 15%). Another set of couples (about 20% of the sample) are still ambivalent when they reach the 7th month of pregnancy.

Should this pride in their children also extend towards themselves, it is justified. Parents can and deserve to derive satisfaction from the pride in their child&rsquo;s success due to their personal role in their development.</li><li>strongest counterargument‚ÜíAs little as 5% of a child&rsquo;s personality is determined by parental influence. This is supported through studies: identical twins raised separately have similar personalities, and adopted siblings raised in the same household are often as different as two people from the population can be. Parents shouldn&rsquo;t be proud of themselves, as they do not have nearly as large a role in their child&rsquo;s development as they likely suppose.</li><li>response‚ÜíAbout 50% of personality is genetic from birth. Even if you don&rsquo;t add the 5% of the counterargument to this figure, this means that the parents are the majority stakeholder in their child&rsquo;s development ever since the child is conceived. Additionally, the counterargument makes the assumption that you must know the share of your contribution to be proud of your children. In the same way that citizens can be proud of their country constructing a beautiful landmark, one does not need to know what &ldquo;percent&rdquo; or share of something of their contribution to be proud of something. In fact, one does not even need to be the majority stakeholder to derive pride: simply seeing any positive effect from their effort or participation can be sufficient to experience pride.</li></ul></li><li>Parents feeling proud of the action, not the achievement<ul><li>Baseball achievement: Feel pride for driving, etc.</li><li>If successful, then my parents are proud<ul><li>inverse‚Üíif not successful, my parents are not proud</li><li>converse‚Üíif my parents are proud, then I&rsquo;m successful</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Week 5: Achievement<ul><li>Singer&rsquo;s Living to Some Purpose<ul><li>he argues‚ÜîIf it doesn&rsquo;t have an objective or actual achievement, it doesn&rsquo;t add value to your life.

Because it produces bad effects, i.e. harms social trust, damages various kinds of relationships‚Äîpersonal, professional, political&mdash; leads people to harm based on false information, etc. 3. Because lying cannot be something that we all do. If we all did it, nobody would believe me when I lie and so it would be pointless to lie. But if we all cannot do it, why am I allowed to do it and not you and you and you‚Ä¶ But then we are all doing it. 4. Because it is an assertion of what you believe to be false and this violates a convention of language. 5. Because of the intention behind the lie, i.e. to deceive another person. 6. Because telling a lie is a violation of the autonomy of the hearer. It is an exercise of power over another rational individual‚Äîall the more insidious because it sometimes is undetected. 7. Because telling a lie treats another person as a means to some end. This is true even of lies told to benefit the hearer. In such case he is treated as a means to his own good. 8. Because telling lie is a violation of a duty to yourself to be truthful. 9. Because a principle forbidding lying would be agreed to by all of us if we were trying to find a principle to regulate our common behavior that we could all agree to.</li></ol></li><li>Always, sometimes, never lie<ul><li>Never lie<ul><li>Kant says, &ldquo;To be truthful (honest) in all declarations is therefore a sacred unconditional command of reason, and not to be limited by any expediency.&rdquo;<ul><li>Categorical Imperative‚ÜîYou are not permitted to lie (in these circumstances) unless everyone is entitled to lie.

From a consequentialist view, this would, on average, enables a lie to gain utility most effectively. If one truly felt the need to lie, say to save a life, this would ensure that the lie is most likely to work.</li><li>It is possible for something to be both immoral yet practical in some cases. This is what this position argues is the case with lying. There is a point in which an individual may decide it is worth it to lie, to save a life, etc.. In the case that one does, one would wish that this lie is most effective. This would most effectively secure the desired outcome.</li><li>The reason why lying often works in the first place is due to the expectation that one does not lie. A lie&rsquo;s effectiveness is correlated to the degree the recipient does not expect to receive a lie. This expectation is strongest under the categorical imperative condition‚Äîthat it is immoral to lie, and one should not ever lie. The breaking of this condition and therefore expectation enables lies to be more effective.</li><li>To say that lying is ever morally permissable to lie sets a dangerous precedent. At what what benefit, or cost, or point is it suddenly permissable to lie? To save a life? To save someone from harm? Generalizing this, drawing the line of whether to lie or not may be obscure and self-serving‚Äîanyone can declare that their lie was justified. In this case, the effectiveness of lying would be reduced. If lying should be morally impermissable, it would be of a greater effectiveness than previously mentioned.<ul><li>To clarify, we declare that lying is never morally permissable, but may be, under certain conditions, practical. This is subjective and depends on the person.</li></ul></li><li>CA: There are situations in which lying would be used to secure negative utility‚Äîfraud, theft, and many modern crimes are accompanied with lying. If this view is truly rooted in practicality or consequentalism, then it is not safe to assume that lying will be used only in cases to &ldquo;save a life&rdquo;. Most likely, there will be immoral people who will take advantage of the immorality of lying to cheat others.</li><li>Response: It is true that a lie under the CI condition could be used to secure negative utility more effectively. The real value of this position is not utility, but moral agency‚Äîthat is, one&rsquo;s ability to affect change through their moral character.</li><li>Possible CA to above response: The above response makes an invalid link between moral agency and physical agency. The fact that one&rsquo;s choice doesn&rsquo;t affect one&rsquo;s surroundings as effectively because lying is not immoral does not diminish the moral agency one experiences. In the above condition, one experiences the same degree of moral agency, whether the lie is effective or not.</li><li>A different possible response to above CA: We can also say that it is an imperative to act positive utility, but that&rsquo;s a different story.</li><li>I ran out of time to polish as I have another Midterm (this time in Computer Science) tomorrow haha</li></ul></li><li><strong>Lying should be done on the other person‚Äôs desires rather than the lier‚Äôs interpretation.</strong></li><li>The dying husband scenario: what if the wife wanted her husband to die a painful death?</li><li>Lying to serve someone‚Äôs self-image. It‚Äôs obvious that this is a subjective of whether it is moral or not moral to lie.</li><li>Just because the outcome is positive does not mean its‚Äô justified. Say I want to assassinate someone, miss and end up killing someone who was going to commit genocide. Just because the action‚Äôs outcome was positive does not mean that it is justified.</li><li>Lying is immoral because it creates an aberrance in the knowledge of the world. We have a moral obligation to advance the search of truth of humankind in this world. This absence of truth has the potential to lead others astray. It is this tinkering with the general knowledge of¬† the world that is immoral.
