I seize this opportunity to make a full and unequivocal recantation, and thus publicly to ask pardon of my God, of my country, and of my brethren the poor slaves, for having uttered a sentiment so full of timidity, injustice and absurdity. A similar recantation, from my pen, was published in the Genius of Universal Emancipation at Baltimore, in September, 1829.

I <strong>will</strong> be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this subject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write, with moderation. No! no! Tell a man whose house is on fire, to give a moderate alarm; tell him to moderately rescue his wife from the hand of the ravisher; tell the mother to gradually extricate her babe from the fire into which it has fallen; &ndash; but urge me not to use moderation in a cause like the present. I am in earnest &ndash; I will not equivocate &ndash; I will not excuse &ndash; I will not retreat a single inch &ndash; AND I WILL BE HEARD.

Next, negroes, suspected of conspiring to raise an insurrection, were caught up and hanged in all parts of the State: then, white men, supposed to be leagued with the negroes; and finally, strangers, from neighboring States, going thither on business, were, in many instances subjected to the same fate. Thus went on this process of hanging, from gamblers to negroes, from negroes to white citizens, and from these to strangers; till, dead men were seen literally dangling from the boughs of trees upon every road side; and in numbers almost sufficient, to rival the native Spanish moss of the country, as a drapery of the forest</li></ul></li><li>a group of lawless in spirit‚Äïby such examples, by instances of the perpetrators of such acts going unpunished, <strong>the lawless in spirit, are encouraged to become lawless in practice</strong>; and having been used to no restraint, but dread of punishment, they thus become, absolutely unrestrained.</li><li>notably, Abraham lincoln discounts the situation through‚Äïcompleting the audience&rsquo;s thoughts<ul><li>You are, perhaps, ready to ask, &ldquo;What has this to do with the perpetuation of our political institutions?&rdquo; I answer, it has much to do with it</li><li>But, it may be asked, why suppose danger to our political institutions?

It began, as I have said, in 1819; and it did not terminate till 1821. Missouri would not yield the point; and congress &ndash; that is, a majority in congress &ndash; by repeated votes, showed a determination to not admit the state unless it should yield. After several failures, and great labor on the part of Mr. Clay to so present the question that a majority could consent to the admission, it was, by a vote, rejected, and as all seemed to think, finally. A sullen gloom hung over the nation. All felt that the rejection of Missouri, was equivalent to a dissolution of the Union, because those states which already had, what Missouri was rejected for refusing to relinquish, would go with Missouri. All deprecated and deplored this, but none saw how to avert it. For the judgment of Members to be convinced of the necessity of yielding, was not the whole difficulty; each had a constituency to meet, and to answer to. Mr. Clay, though worn down, and exhausted, was appealed to by members, to renew his efforts at compromise. He did so, and by some judicious modifications of his plan, coupled with laborious efforts with individual members, and his own over-mastering eloquence upon the floor, he finally secured the admission of the State. Brightly, and captivating as it had previously shown, it was now perceived that his great eloquence, was a mere embellishment, or, at most, but a helping hand to his inventive genius, and his devotion to his country in the day of her extreme peril.</li></ul></li><li>Divine Providence, ending is very religious</li></ul></li><li><a href=http://vlib.us/amdocs/texts/kansas.html rel=noopener>Speech on the Kansas Nebraska Act</a>
<a href=https://www.nps.gov/liho/learn/historyculture/peoriaspeech.htm rel=noopener>Peoria Speech, October 16, 1854 - Lincoln Home National Historic Site (U.S. National Park Service)</a><ul><li>response to‚ÄïDouglas</li><li>significance‚Äïhis most ambitious speech before presidency</li><li>self-interest (how Lincoln uses it)‚Äïselfishness</li><li>Near eighty years ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal; but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration, that for some men to enslave others is a ‚Äòsacred right of self-government.‚Äô These principles can not stand together. They are as opposite as God and mammon; and whoever holds to the one, must despise the other.‚Äù</li><li>I trust I understand, and truly estimate the right of self-government. My faith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own,lies at the foundation of the sense of justice there is in me. I extend the principles to communities of men, as well as to individuals. I so extend it, because it is politically wise, as well as naturally just: politically wise, in saving us from broils about matters which do not concern us. Here, or at Washington, I would not trouble myself with the oyster laws of Virginia, or the cranberry laws of Indiana.</li><li>The doctrine of self government is right&ndash;absolutely and eternally right&ndash;but it has no just application, as here attempted. Or perhaps I should rather say that whether it has such just application depends upon whether a Negro is <strong>not</strong> or is a man. If he is <strong>not</strong> a man, why in that case, he who is a man may, as a matter of self-government, do just as he pleases with him. But if the Negro is a man, is it not to that extent, a total destruction of self-government, to say that he too shall not govern <strong>himself</strong> ? When the white man governs himself, and also governs <strong>another</strong> man, that is __more __ than self-government&ndash;that is despotism. If the Negro is a <strong>man</strong> , why then my ancient faith teaches me that ‚Äúall men are created equal;‚Äù and that there can be no moral right in connection with one man&rsquo;s making a slave of another</li><li>Judge Douglas frequently, with bitter irony and sarcasm,paraphrases our argument by saying ‚ÄúThe white people of Nebraska are good enough to govern themselves, <strong>but they are not good enough to govern a few miserable Negroes</strong> !!‚Äù</li><li>Well I doubt not that the people of Nebraska are, and will continue to be as good as the average of people elsewhere. I do not say the contrary.

If it prove to be true, as is probable, that the people of Utah are in open rebellion in the United States, then Judge Douglas is in favor of repealing their territorial organization, and attaching them to the adjoining States for judicial purposes.

The Republicans can fall in with it without taking back anything they have ever said. To be sure, it would be a considerable backing down by Judge Douglas from his much vaunted doctrine of self-government for the territories; but this is only additional proof of what was very plain from the beginning, that that doctrine was a mere deceitful pretense for the benefit of slavery.

In retaliation to remarks that Lincoln had said, Douglas replied saying ‚ÄúMr. Lincoln asserts, as a fundamental principle of this government, that there must be uniformity in the local laws and domestic institutions of each and all the States of the Union; and he therefore, invites all the non-slaveholding States to band together, organize as one body, and make war upon slavery in the states that still practiced slavery‚Äù (Richard, 1965). __¬†__</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>[September 21st, 2020](Daily Document/September 21st, 2020.md) LD Debates<ul><li><a href=https://www.nps.gov/liho/learn/historyculture/debate1.htm rel=noopener>First Debate: Ottawa, Illinois - Lincoln Home National Historic Site (U.S. National Park Service)</a><ul><li>Introduction<ul><li>Turns tables on the conspiracy theory, Lincoln is a conspirator</li><li>Lincoln abolitionizes the Whig Party</li></ul></li><li>The agreement between Lincoln, Whigs, Abolitionists, etc.</li><li>Lincoln argues that the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was the fire that started the fracture</li><li>&ldquo;I think, and shall try to show, that it is wrong; wrong in its direct effect, letting slavery into Kansas and Nebraska-and wrong in its prospective principle, allowing it to spread to every other part of the wide world, where men can be found inclined to take it.<ul><li>&ldquo;This <strong>declared</strong> indifference, but, as I must think, covert real zeal for the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate.

They are just what we would be in their situation. If slavery did not now exist among them, they would not introduce it. If it did now exist amongst us, we should not instantly give it up. This I believe of the masses North and South. Doubtless there are individuals on both sides, who would not hold slaves under any circumstances; and others who would gladly introduce slavery anew, if it were out of existence.

[Laughter.] I will say here, while upon this subject, that I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so. I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races. There is a physical difference between the two, which, in my judgment, will probably forever forbid their living together upon the footing of perfect equality, and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position. I have never said anything to the contrary, but I hold that, notwithstanding all this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. [Loud cheers.] I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man. I agree with Judge Douglas he is not my equal in many respects-certainly not in color, perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment. But in the right to eat the bread, without the leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, <strong>he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man.</strong> [Great applause.]</li></ul></li><li>Writing Tips<ul><li>Remove perhaps, arguably, any other qualifiers unless you really need them<ul><li>If you want to argue, argue it.

<a href=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45477/song-of-myself-1892-version rel=noopener>Song of Myself (1892 version) by Walt Whitman | Poetry Foundation</a><ul><li>In the sixth section of the poem, the poet transitions to a story about a child holding a handful of leaves and asking, ‚ÄúWhat is the grass?‚Äù Though the poet knows this is an impossible question, he continues to muse on it, thinking that the grass may be the leaves, the child, of God. He goes on to catalog all the things he sees in the world: the people, animals, and natural features. He declares that he loves them all just as they are and loves the way they fit together. The poet sees them all as part of God‚Äôs works, just as the grass is a simple thing that is still divine because God made it.</li><li>Section 15‚ÄïThe poet observes or &ldquo;takes in&rdquo; his surroundings. One can observe the sounds of the singer, conductor beating time, the plane whistling, the drove singing. There is an example of a prostitute that lasts for three lines, which the author regards the booing crowd with disdain<ul><li>The final three lines of this section work to pull the chaos of this vast catalog of sensory impressions into a kind of unity, and that unity is the self that has perceived them. Any single ‚ÄúI‚Äù has one vantage point, one set of eyes and ears that is continually absorbing the welter of sense impressions around the ‚ÄúI.‚Äù From that vantage point, it feels as if the world is ‚Äútending inward to me,‚Äù inclining, moving, stretching in toward the self‚Äôs eyes and ears and nose and tongue. At the same time, the ‚ÄúI‚Äù feels something in the self that is extending out toward the world, toward that endless stream of sights and sounds and smells. ‚ÄúI tend outward to them‚Äù: our senses reach out to the things of the world, always; our eyes are hungry to see, and our ears are hungry to hear. But so many things pass in front of our eyes and ears that we miss or ignore or are oblivious to, so we need also to ‚Äúattend‚Äù to them, to take care to register and record them (as Whitman has done in this section with such loving care). So it is always what Whitman calls an ‚Äúinflux‚Äù and an ‚Äúefflux,‚Äù the world incessantly whirling toward our senses, and our senses reaching out to absorb that world. And that, more or less, is what we are: we are the things we have seen, heard, touched, tasted, smelled: ‚Äúsuch as it is to be of these more or less I am.‚Äù No idea we have, no word we use, no love we feel, did not originate ‚Äúout there.‚Äù They all entered in through our open senses, our senses which extended out to embrace them and then tended to them as we absorbed them: and out of all those endless stimuli, we each weave the unique song of our self.</li></ul></li><li>Section 28‚Äï<ul><li>This section contains the famous &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; in which Whitman seems to be under attack from himself.

The idea has been given out at the North, and even in the border States, that we are too small and too weak to maintain a separate nationality. This is a great mistake. In extent of territory we embrace five hundred and sixty-four thousand square miles and upward. This is upward of two hundred thousand square miles more than was included within the limits of the original thirteen States. It is an area of country more than double the territory of France or the Austrian empire. France, in round numbers, has but two hundred and twelve thousand square miles. Austria, in round numbers, has two hundred and forty-eight thousand square miles. Ours is greater than both combined. It is greater than all France, Spain, Portugal, and Great Britain, including England, Ireland, and Scotland, together. In population we have upward of five millions, according to the census of 1860; this includes white and black. The entire population, including white and black, of the original thirteen States, was less than four millions in 1790, and still less in 76, when the independence of our fathers was achieved. If they, with a less population, dared maintain their independence against the greatest power on earth, shall we have any apprehension of maintaining ours now?</li><li>In this connection I take this occasion to state, that I was not without grave and serious apprehensions, that if the worst came to the worst, and cutting loose from the old government should be the only remedy for our safety and security, it would be attended with much more serious ills than it has been as yet. Thus far we have seen none of those incidents which usually attend revolutions. No such material as such convulsions usually throw up has been seen. Wisdom, prudence, and patriotism, have marked every step of our progress thus far.

Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration. Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always will be, a relation between labor and capital producing mutual benefits. The error is in assuming that the whole labor of community exists within that relation. A few men own capital, and that few avoid labor themselves, and with their capital hire or buy another few to labor for them. A large majority belong to neither class&ndash;neither work for others nor have others working for them. In most of the Southern States a majority of the whole people of all colors are neither slaves nor masters, while in the Northern a large majority are neither hirers nor hired. Men, with their families&ndash;wives, sons, and daughters&ndash;work for themselves on their farms, in their houses, and in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and asking no favors of capital on the one hand nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Many independent men everywhere in these States a few years back in their lives were hired laborers. The prudent, penniless beginner in the world labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself, then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him. This is the just and generous and prosperous system which opens the way to all, gives hope to all, and consequent energy and progress and improvement of condition to all.&rdquo;</li></ul></li><li>Bromwich Writing Tips<ul><li>Use the word &ldquo;refer&rdquo; over &ldquo;reference&rdquo;</li><li>Advocate is a transitive verb‚ÄïI &ldquo;advocated&rdquo; the destruction of a word.

To such I would say: You desire peace; and you blame me that we do not have it. But how can we attain it? There are but three conceivable ways. First, to suppress the rebellion by force of arms. This I am trying to do. Are you for it? If you are, so far we are agreed. If you are not for it, a second way is to give up the Union. I am against this. Are you for it? If you are, you should say so plainly. If you are not for force, nor yet for dissolution, there only remains some imaginable compromise. I do not believe any compromise, embracing the maintenance of the Union, is now possible. All I learn, leads to a directly opposite belief. The strength of the rebellion, is its military&ndash;its army. That army dominates all the country, and all the people, within its range. Any offer of terms made by any man or men within that range, in opposition to that army, is simply nothing for the present; because such man or men, have no power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise, if one were made with them. To illustrate. Suppose refugees from the South, and peace men of the North, get together in convention, and frame and proclaim a compromise embracing a restoration of the Union; in what way can that compromise be used to keep Lee&rsquo;s army out of Pennsylvania?

Fremont attempted military emancipation, I forbade it, because I did not then think it an indispensable necessity. When a little later, Gen. Cameron, then Secretary of War, suggested the arming of the blacks, I objected, because I did not yet think it an indispensable necessity. When, still later, Gen. Hunter attempted military emancipation, I again forbade it, because I did not yet think the indispensable necessity had come. When, in March, and May, and July 1862 I made earnest, and successive appeals to the border states to favor compensated emancipation, I believed the indispensable necessity for military emancipation, and arming the blacks would come, unless averted by that measure. They declined the proposition; and I was, in my best judgment, driven to the alternative of either surrendering the Union, and with it, the Constitution, or of laying strong hand upon the colored element. I chose the latter. In choosing it, I hoped for greater gain than loss; but of this, I was not entirely confident. More than a year of trial now shows no loss by it in our foreign relations, none in our home popular sentiment, none in our white military force,&mdash;no loss by it any how or any ]where. On the contrary, it shows a gain of quite a hundred and thirty thousand soldiers, seamen, and laborers. These are palpable facts, about which, as facts, there can be no cavilling.
