The Ark</h1></a><p>The Ark Project was the greatest collaborative work of humankind, the pinnacle of the world&rsquo;s wealthiest banding together to save humanity. When glaciers began melting, they collected genetic samples and data from of all life that ever lived. When the Flood finally came, nations that collaborated were gifted enormous ships and survived. The rest perished. The Ark now roamed the seas, waiting for the right time to rebuild, while flotillas of former nations wandered aimlessly. Little did they know what the Ark truly meant.</p><hr><p>Charles rapped on the door. Three taps. Almost immediately, it slid open. As a figure laced in a silky white robe materialized, Charles kneeled.</p><p>&ldquo;You must be Noah. I have made the pilgrimage to the Ark. I have come for my Wish.&rdquo; Charles didn&rsquo;t know Noah&rsquo;s actual name. He didn&rsquo;t have to. Every member of the Saviors insisted on being called Noah: a reminder, to all humanity, of the immense debt they were owed.</p><p>&ldquo;I see. Please come inside.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Before we begin, Charles, I just wanted to make sure you understand the parameters,&rdquo; Noah continued. &ldquo;You only get one wish per lifetime. You can make any request from our servers, databases, or genetic banks. We reserve the right to refuse foolish wishes.&rdquo;</p><p>With a deep breath, Charles made his wish. Noah made a cry of surprise.</p><hr><p>Charles sat twiddling his thumbs in the waiting room when Noah finally returned from the server room, clipboard in hand, face drooping with fatigue.</p><p>&ldquo;You know Charles, I really like you. Most of my supplicants ask for seeds, animals to farm, perhaps the knowledge how to garden. Maybe how to assemble weapons. Something to spice up life, to make things interesting.&rdquo;</p><p>A faint, bittersweet smile pursed on Noah&rsquo;s lips. He slowly continued.</p><p>&ldquo;Charles, your grandmother&rsquo;s name is Doris. And by making your Wish, you have given us the most intellectually engaging request of this year. I have spoken to the Saviors and we have agreed. You deserve to be the first human sent to the land when the Flood subsides.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>“Yes. The Ark has observed that the glaciers are reforming. The expedition will begin tomorrow. I&rsquo;m sure this must be exciting news. I thought it would be better that I tell you this in person. Any questions?"</p><p>Charles sat frozen, with an odd mixture of excitement and unease. He would abandon his friends. He would abandon his family. He would abandon everything.</p><p>&ldquo;I…just don&rsquo;t know what to say.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>Noah was meditating in his chamber when he realized that he was still thinking of Charles. He thinks of the information he left out: that Doris was one of the original Saviors, that Charles inherited his seat, that the Flood would never subside. <em>I answer everything people ask for,</em> he consoled himself. <em>Nothing more, nothing less.</em></p><p>He continued reading his book. This one was interesting. <em>You have to be ruthless to succeed,</em> it read. Reading always consoled him. It was a reminder of what the Ark was: a monopoly of knowledge, that would always keep the Saviors in power.</p><p>Ten minutes later Noah will watch the command screen as Charles is launched. He will watch the dot fly off, before fading into the abyss, disappearing forever.</p><a href=#scholastics-submission><h1 id=scholastics-submission><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Scholastics Submission</h1></a><p>Charles rapped on the door.
