I&rsquo;m excited to take on the challenge of the coursework. I&rsquo;ve studied a little bit of data structures and algorithms under the Google CSSI-Coursera program, but am in need of a more formal introduction to their concepts (and the C programming language :P).</p><a href=#2-tell-us-about-your-favorite-extracurricular-of-the-past-two-years-what-made-it-special-for-you-what-did-it-push-you-to-accomplish-what-does-it-say-about-who-you-are-150-words-max-><h2 id=2-tell-us-about-your-favorite-extracurricular-of-the-past-two-years-what-made-it-special-for-you-what-did-it-push-you-to-accomplish-what-does-it-say-about-who-you-are-150-words-max-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>2.

The opportunity to serve 3,300 students as student body president has given me opportunities to grow, expand my interests, and push myself beyond my comfort zone.</p><p>When I first decided to run for student council, I hoped to run for a minor position‚Äîin fact, I lost four out of five middle-school elections, winning the last because it took second place. But when the clipboard landed on my lap, my jaw dropped. Every position overflowed with names except class president, where there was one‚Äîthe most popular candidate, the incumbent, whom nobody dared oppose. I closed my eyes, and took a deep breath.</p><p>One decision, to run and be interested, led to a new circle of friends, a surprise victory, and a team that I call family. I am eternally grateful for student council, for it has introduced me to an entirely different perspective to leadership.</p><a href=#3-why-are-you-interested-in-joining-yale-computer-society-150-words-max-><h2 id=3-why-are-you-interested-in-joining-yale-computer-society-150-words-max-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>3.

There nothing quite like discovering a solution by oneself and seeing it implemented from start to finish. These moments, of immense clarity and euphoria, are what I live for.</p><p>I enjoy math and writing, but programming is an entirely different beast&ndash;it allows one to create a living tangible product, one that breathes and responds to every change, until you get it just right. I hope to keep in touch with this side in Yale Computer Society.</p><a href=#what-will-be-your-extracurricular-commitments-this-semester-><h2 id=what-will-be-your-extracurricular-commitments-this-semester-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What Will Be Your Extracurricular Commitments This Semester? *</h2></a><p>I am currently a board member of Yale Effective Altruism (I was invited and accepted into their Summer Fellowship in senior year high school as well as the Oxford Uni In-Depth Fellowship, and have been an active member since) and am currently interested in running for Senator or FCC representative of my residential college, Yale Computer Society, Yale Machine Learning Society, YUDI, and Yale Entrepreneurial Society, although the final list will likely be far shorter.</p><p>I believe I will reliably be able to invest about 2 hours per week, with the recognition that time is generally not the primary issue but priorities. I am willing to prioritize activities as important and urgent over social or other extracurricular activities when needed.</p><a href=#spring-2022><h2 id=spring-2022><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Spring 2022</h2></a><a href=#why-do-you-want-to-join-the-development-team-50-word-minimum-><h2 id=why-do-you-want-to-join-the-development-team-50-word-minimum-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Why Do You Want to Join the Development Team?

Since then, I have expanded to fullstack development, Node.js, PostgreSql, Flutter, etc. I&rsquo;ve falling in love with the ability to rapidly prototype apps.</p><a href=#why-do-you-want-to-join-ycs-50-word-minimum-><h2 id=why-do-you-want-to-join-ycs-50-word-minimum-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Why Do You Want to Join y/cs?

Additionally, I actually have never built with React‚ÄîI really have been looking for a reason to get into it since it&rsquo;s so popular in the industry!
