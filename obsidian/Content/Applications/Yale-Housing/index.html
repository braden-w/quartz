It is definitely my most defining feature. Usually, it</p><p>is because I am very happy. Whenever people ask me why I am so</p><p>optimistic, my answer is simple: it‚Äôs a lot harder to make history</p><p>when you don‚Äôt believe in the future. I don&rsquo;t define my optimism as</p><p>an ignorance of facts, but a belief that I have control over my</p><p>future, and that I will make it better. I feel that spreading that sense</p><p>of control and vision with others is incredibly powerful. I live by the</p><p>motto, &ldquo;To be interesting, be interested&rdquo;. I enjoy helping others with</p><p>compassion and helping them feel special. Even if I may have</p><p>accomplishments, when I talk to others, I never wish my</p><p>conversations to be about me, but about them.</p><a href=#what-extracurricular-commitments-have-been-most-important-to-you-what-new-activities-do-you-hope-to-explore-at-yale-><h2 id=what-extracurricular-commitments-have-been-most-important-to-you-what-new-activities-do-you-hope-to-explore-at-yale-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What Extracurricular Commitments Have Been Most Important to You? What New Activities Do You Hope to Explore at Yale? *</h2></a><p>In high school, my largest commitments were in student council,</p><p>Boy Scouts, math/physics/coding team, internships/business</p><p>competitions, blogging/writing competitions, and volunteering&ndash;in summary, English, STEM, and leadership/business. At Yale, I hope</p><p>to tackle philosophical questions at YEA, business/startup clubs,</p><p>writing journals, and engineering/computer science. I also am really</p><p>interested in the arts, singing, and dancing. I was the star of the</p><p>school play in elementary school, and carry with me a love and</p><p>appreciation for theater.</p><a href=#what-do-you-like-to-do-for-fun-><h2 id=what-do-you-like-to-do-for-fun-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What Do You Like to Do for Fun? *</h2></a><p>One of my brother and I&rsquo;s favorite pasttimes is to sit down together</p><p>in my room and watch YouTube/TV Shows with a bag of Hot</p><p>Cheetos or popcorn (we finished the entirety of Game of Thrones</p><p>and Grand which this way). Otherwise, we enjoy playing tennis and</p><p>joking around together. I occasionally play video games (though</p><p>not as much recently): Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with my</p><p>friends, Civilization V, Clash Royale, and a few other single player</p><p>games. Feeling tangible progression in a skill set is really enjoyable</p><p>for me, and I enjoy learning new things (especially because</p><p>progress in the early stages of skill development is so rapid).</p><p>During quarantine, I grinded out Harvard CS50 and a Google</p><p>Cloud Engineering course in a few days. Recently, I&rsquo;ve gotten back</p><p>into playing piano and violin for fun. I also really enjoyed watching</p><p>Silicon Valley, which is perhaps my favorite TV show of all time.</p><p>Finally, I really enjoy tinkering, productivity hacks, and optimizing</p><p>processes! I recently made a program to generate an API request</p><p>to bulk delete I love digging into api‚Äôs, batch scripts, to-do lists, and</p><p>new approaches to automate new tasks/reduce friction for good</p><p>habits</p><a href=#what-is-your-greatest-concern-about-coming-to-college-><h2 id=what-is-your-greatest-concern-about-coming-to-college-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What is Your Greatest Concern About Coming to College? *</h2></a><p>Making decisions. I am interested in a lot of things and have a</p><p>tendency to overload myself (for fear of the opportunity cost), and I</p><p>hope that I can be comfortable making decisions at Yale that may</p><p>close some doors but open many more.</p><a href=#what-are-your-academic-interests-and-what-subjects-do-you-hope-to-explore-at-yale-><h2 id=what-are-your-academic-interests-and-what-subjects-do-you-hope-to-explore-at-yale-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What Are Your Academic Interests, and What Subjects Do You Hope to Explore at Yale? *</h2></a><p>Among my biggest academic interests are Economics, Computer</p><p>Science, Data Science/Statistics, Mechanical Engineering, writing,</p><p>and business. I am planning to</p><a href=#what-was-your-favorite-class-in-high-school-why-><h2 id=what-was-your-favorite-class-in-high-school-why-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What Was Your Favorite Class in High School? Why? *</h2></a><p>AP Statistics. I was the youngest person in the class having taken</p><p>the AP Calculus test in 9th grade, and was also somewhat the</p><p>class clown because of that fact. I had an amazing teacher, Mr.</p><p>Mynster, who was incredibly bright and the quintessential &ldquo;Jack of</p><p>all trades, master of many&rdquo;. In fact, many years ago, he was</p><p>admitted to Harvard as an undergrad (and later as a grad), but</p><p>unfortunately went to a local college to help his family&rsquo;s financial</p><p>situation at the time. During lunch, we would talk for ages about</p><p>computers, politics, economics, business, math, and so much</p><p>more.</p><a href=#what-kinds-of-academic-assignments-do-you-find-most-difficult-why-><h2 id=what-kinds-of-academic-assignments-do-you-find-most-difficult-why-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What Kinds of Academic Assignments Do You Find Most Difficult? Why? *</h2></a><p>Writing. To be clear, I love math and writing. To me, math has</p><p>always been straightforward or even blunt, finding the right method</p><p>among numerous, if not innumerable, wrong ones. However,</p><p>writing is both wonderful and peculiar in rewarding the opposite:</p><p>the array of options that writing presents, limitless and many viable,</p><p>makes it a quest of finding the best way, not the right way. There is</p><p>no ‚Äúfinished‚Äù state, nor trick, that ultimately creates a perfect piece.</p><p>Without guidance, I often can spend many hours on a piece and</p><p>not be satsified.</p><a href=#what-is-important-for-your-college-adviser-to-know-about-you-><h2 id=what-is-important-for-your-college-adviser-to-know-about-you-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What is Important for Your College Adviser to Know About You? *</h2></a><p>When I first decided to run for student council, I was hoping to run</p><p>for a minor position‚Äîin fact, I lost my first four middle-school</p><p>elections, winning the last only because it took second place. All of</p><p>my friends had moved, and so during lunch, I visited the</p><p>informational meeting, partly because I had nobody to sit with. But</p><p>when the clipboard finally landed on my lap, my jaw dropped.</p><p>Every freshman council position overflowed with names, except</p><p>class president, where there was only one‚Äîthe most popular</p><p>candidate, the incumbent, whom nobody dared oppose. There was</p><p>no longer a consolation ‚ÄúRoom Representative‚Äù position if I lost. In</p><p>that moment, I took a deep calming breath, and decided to go all</p><p>in. One decision, to simply run and be interested, led to two</p><p>enthralling weeks of campaigning beyond my comfort zone,</p><p>meeting hundreds of new people, and discovering a new side to</p><p>myself. After a thrilling surprise victory, that one decision led to</p><p>years of new experiences and seeing leadership through a new</p><p>lens. Ultimately, one decision, to simply take a chance and push</p><p>my limits, taught me that those chances are almost always worth</p><p>taking. Joining student council was the biggest plot twist of my life,</p><p>and I am so grateful for the many opportunities and lessons ever</p><p>since.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3></h3><ul class=backlinks><li></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3></h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p></p><ul><li><a href=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/braden-w>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
