For example, I have dreamt of leading a company to innovate at the intersection of artificial intelligence and vehicular transportation (flight), designing tools that empower others, improve safety, and build a cleaner future. During college, I would like to accustom myself to consulting/banking and tech jobs, understanding the cultures of business and technology and preparing for that vision.</p><p>Is there any specific reason why you have chosen the particular college major or career above? *</p><p>Given my background in business and STEM, I felt that Yale‚Äôs special joint major in Economics & Computer Science is a great fit. I am interested in many subjects, such as writing, and Yale is incredibly supportive of interdisciplinary learning, with a very strong literary arts department to boot.</p><p>To me, innovation is not just problem solving, but problem finding: to relentlessly pursue the challenges of tomorrow, seek problems nobody else has imagined before, and discover novel solutions that push humanity forward. At the intersection of business and technology, I hope to achieve innovation.</p><a href=#looking-back-on-your-years-at-ahs-do-you-have-a-favorite-class-if-so-why-was-it-your-favorite-><h2 id=looking-back-on-your-years-at-ahs-do-you-have-a-favorite-class-if-so-why-was-it-your-favorite-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Looking Back on Your Years at AHS, Do You Have a Favorite Class? If So, Why Was it Your Favorite? *</h2></a><p>AP English Language. I absolutely loved Ms. Hatheway, and she taught with a genuine passion for the subject that was tangible in both the classroom and curriculum. It was also my greatest performance in a class: I aced every essay in 2nd semester. Though I applied to over ten writing competitions and received nothing that year (compared to a stellar sophomore year), the class helped turn an incredibly discouraging experience into an eye-opening one where I was able to refocus on my enjoyment of the subject. I attribute Ms. Hatheway as the mentor who encouraged me to seriously pursue writing.</p><a href=#looking-back-on-your-four-years-at-ahs-do-you-have-a-favorite-teacher-if-so-why-was-he-or-she-your-favorite-><h2 id=looking-back-on-your-four-years-at-ahs-do-you-have-a-favorite-teacher-if-so-why-was-he-or-she-your-favorite-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Looking Back on Your Four Years at AHS, Do You Have a Favorite Teacher? If So, Why Was He or She Your Favorite? *</h2></a><p>Mr. Mynster. To me, he is the embodiment of both parts of the quote, ‚ÄúTo be interesting, be interested‚Äù‚Äîa man who is captivating having achieved so much, but also extraordinary with his compassion to help others. Not only is Mr. Mynster incredibly intelligent (even offered admission to Harvard in his undergrad), but his belief that learning transcends education deeply resonated with me. Him being self-taught in many different topics (such as taking the bar exam ‚Äúfor fun‚Äù), he is the quintessential ‚Äújack of all trades, master of many,‚Äù which I strive to become. We had many interesting discussions about business, technology, politics, stocks, and more. My personal favorite memory is when he invited me to try his $400+ VR headset.</p><p>The fact that Mr. Mynster teaches for fun and is willing to invest time in teaching his students is truly inspirational to me. His stocks as a savvy investor earn him ample money to make a living, but he considers teaching to be his serious hobby. Mr. Mynster is living proof that we can pursue our dreams, help others, and do the thing that we love‚Äîto be both interested and interesting. I am honored to call him not only my teacher, but a mentor and friend who I aspire to be and will cherish for years to come.</p><a href=#you-have-been-incredibly-successful-academically-but-there-must-have-been-some-class-or-teacher-who-really-challenged-you-looking-back-on-your-four-years-at-ahs-which-class-or-teacher-did-you-find-most-challenging-and-why-><h2 id=you-have-been-incredibly-successful-academically-but-there-must-have-been-some-class-or-teacher-who-really-challenged-you-looking-back-on-your-four-years-at-ahs-which-class-or-teacher-did-you-find-most-challenging-and-why-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>You Have Been Incredibly Successful Academically, but There Must Have Been Some Class or Teacher Who Really Challenged You. Looking Back on Your Four Years at AHS, Which Class or Teacher Did You Find Most Challenging and Why? *</h2></a><p>Mr. Sylvia‚Äôs AP Literature class. During that time, I needed to balance work with family issues as my grandmother&rsquo;s dementia worsened (we drove a 70-minute commute to visit/tend to her every week). It was the first time I struggled in an English Class (right after AP English Language), but I am very proud to have taken on the challenge.</p><p>On our first major essay, I received a D+, dropping my grade almost 10 percent into solid B territory. My essay was covered in criticisms, many which I did not understand and took personally, while others who had historically struggled in english were receiving full marks. My grade seemed irrecoverable. Considering I had received full marks on almost every essay last year, I was aghast.</p><p>Eventually, after many hours of angst and reflection at home, I mustered the strength to talk to Mr. Sylvia for areas of improvement. Not only did the discussion open my eye on a particular style of writing he desired (which I was not used to), but we were able to negotiate ways I could earn back some points on the essay, which I suggested I rewrite my previous and bring drafts of the next essay. Over the next few weeks, I brought drafts to him, which he critiqued and I improved, and through hard work and perseverance, I earned an Athat semester.</p><p>I am very grateful to have approached Mr. Sylvia, as it not only made me a more well-rounded writer, but reinforced that approaching teachers for help can always improve my situation.</p><a href=#you-are-graduating-as-one-of-the-academically-most-successful-students-at-ahs-what-would-you-say-are-your-personal-keys-to-success-how-have-you-managed-to-earn-such-high-marks-in-all-your-classes-over-four-years-><h2 id=you-are-graduating-as-one-of-the-academically-most-successful-students-at-ahs-what-would-you-say-are-your-personal-keys-to-success-how-have-you-managed-to-earn-such-high-marks-in-all-your-classes-over-four-years-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>You Are Graduating as One of the Academically Most Successful Students at AHS. What Would You Say Are Your Personal &ldquo;keys&rdquo; to Success? How Have You Managed to Earn Such High Marks in All Your Classes Over Four Years? *</h2></a><p>I believe that through being highly motivated, most students will have no problem earning high marks. Time being a reflection of priorities, we will always find time to improve the things we prioritize the most. Those who prioritize the right things (including grades, though those should not be the #1 priority
<a href=http://www.paulgraham.com/lesson.html rel=noopener>http://www.paulgraham.com/lesson.html</a>) will generally find success. Sleep should also be a non-issue. These points should be common knowledge.</p><p>Framing to yourself and teachers is incredibly important and often overlooked. I believe I benefited from living by a ‚ÄúI just want to learn, improve my performance, and am willing to put in the effort‚Äù frame. It is much easier to turn down a student who presents themselves as lazy over one that is hardworking, eager, and willing to put in the effort. This, combined with not being afraid to approach the teacher when my grade needed help, helped me avoid several B‚Äôs during my high school career.</p><p>Many students have a frame that relinquishes responsibility of their grade to their teachers, not themselves. For example, they may would say ‚Äúthe teacher gave me an F‚Äù but also ‚ÄúI got an A‚Äù. They also talk to teachers in an entitled manner, as in ‚Äúwhat can you do for me,‚Äù often with as little work as possible. I believe through flipping the script and changing frames, a great more number of students would be able to find success.</p><a href=#what-have-been-your-favorite-things-about-attending-arcadia-high-school-what-have-you-enjoyed-most-><h2 id=what-have-been-your-favorite-things-about-attending-arcadia-high-school-what-have-you-enjoyed-most-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What Have Been Your Favorite Things About Attending Arcadia High School? What Have You Enjoyed Most? *</h2></a><p>I would choose ASB, not just for invaluable leadership development, camaraderie, and countless unforgettable memories, but for teaching me my most important lesson about leadership‚Äîthat one decision often leads to thousands, and we must relentlessly seek and pursue those decisions to push us to new heights.</p><p>When I first decided to run for student council, I was hoping to run for a minor position‚ÄîI lost my first four middle-school elections, winning the last only because it took second place. But when the clipboard landed on my lap, my jaw dropped. Every freshman council position overflowed with names, except class president, where there was only one‚Äîthe most popular candidate, the incumbent, whom nobody dared oppose. There was no longer a consolation ‚ÄúRoom Representative‚Äù position if I lost.
