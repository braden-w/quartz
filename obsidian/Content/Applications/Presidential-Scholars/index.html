Light keyboard clacks ring in quiet math team meetings. Faint scribbles on my writing notebook break the peaceful solitude in my room. I see the world through many lenses, constantly shifting between left and right brain, social and individual, and practical and theoretical, to create ideas worth sharing. Connecting dots, blurring lines, discovering intersections‚ÄîI love to learn and link disciplines together, in honor of the person who started my journey.</p><p>During my childhood, my grandmother visited me every Sunday evening and asked the same question‚Äî‚Äúhow‚Äôs school?‚Äù. As we sat together reading by the fireplace, pages crackling with each turn, my tongue stumbling to find the right words and her voice gently correcting my mistakes, my love for her flourished into one for learning itself. My family being unable to afford private tutors, I grew up with the company of books instead, self-studying and discovering how learning transcends educational format. However, spending many sleepless nights caring for her as she battled with dementia was heartbreaking, as I watched her slowly fade, cry in the middle of nights, forget my name, lose her identity, and eventually pass away last year.</p><p>Learning is my ultimate pledge to commemorate my grandmother and cherish my opportunities‚Äîthe opposite of dementia. Having the opportunity to explore across leadership, technology, and creativity, I do my best to be ambitious, make the most of every opportunity, and become the best possible version of myself I can be for her.</p><a href=#discuss-a-creative-work-that-illustrates-the-way-you-see-the-world-and-the-way-you-see-yourself-in-the-world-the-work-may-be-a-scientific-theory-novel-film-poem-song-or-other-art-form-><h2 id=discuss-a-creative-work-that-illustrates-the-way-you-see-the-world-and-the-way-you-see-yourself-in-the-world-the-work-may-be-a-scientific-theory-novel-film-poem-song-or-other-art-form-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Discuss a Creative Work That Illustrates the Way You See the World and the Way You See Yourself in the World. The Work May Be a Scientific Theory, Novel, Film, Poem, Song, or Other Art Form. *</h2></a><p>There is a poetic beauty in these equations: effort yields exponential gains over talent.</p><p>Talent x Effort = Skill</p><p>Skill x Effort = Achievement</p><p>Achievement = Talent x Effort^2</p><p>These three formulas from the book &ldquo;Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance‚Äù by Angela Duckworth have defined me: to always persevere for my long term goals no matter the hardship, and live by the motto ‚Äúsimple, but not easy‚Äù.</p><p>Reading the book is a catalyst for me to take charge of my life. Every day at 4:30 AM, I jump out of bed to tackle my &ldquo;sharpening the saw&rdquo; list of over 80 habits. My goal is to touch each at least once, from reading, meditating, cold showers, tennis, even singing or dancing‚Äîbecause one minute invested is infinitely better than zero. Additionally, I keep a ‚Äúresum√© of failures,‚Äù which I affectionately call my ‚Äúpaus√©s on successes,‚Äù for a simple reason: although a resum√© is to impress, a paus√© truly inspires. For example:</p><ul><li><p>I failed tryouts for the tennis team all three years from a recurring hip injury, but the pain motivated me to get in the best shape yet</p></li><li><p>I won national awards for my first writing competition, then lost over twelve in a row before getting published</p></li><li><p>I lost ten elections in elementary to middle school, but became the high school president</p></li></ul><p>I am not defined by my victories, but by the challenges I have faced and the questions I ask myself. I characterize my life by the quality of my problems, not quantity of successes; revere visionaries for their ambitions, not just achievements; and see things for what they mean, not just what they are‚Äîto be gritty.</p><a href=#what-is-the-most-significant-contribution-that-you-feel-you-have-made-to-your-communitys-well-being-or-the-well-being-of-an-individual-or-individuals-in-your-community-why-were-you-motivated-to-do-this-what-effect-do-you-think-it-has-had-on-that-person-or-the-community-><h2 id=what-is-the-most-significant-contribution-that-you-feel-you-have-made-to-your-communitys-well-being-or-the-well-being-of-an-individual-or-individuals-in-your-community-why-were-you-motivated-to-do-this-what-effect-do-you-think-it-has-had-on-that-person-or-the-community-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What is the Most Significant Contribution That You Feel You Have Made to Your community‚Äôs Well-being or the Well-being of an Individual or Individuals in Your Community? Why Were You Motivated to Do This? What Effect Do You Think it Has Had on That Person or the Community? *</h2></a><p>My greatest mission is to connect and live by the Dr. Seuss quote, ‚ÄúTo the world you may be one person; but to one person you may be the world.‚Äù I learned this after meeting one of my closest friends in a spectacular display‚Äîas she screamed, cried, and ran out the door mid-lecture during math class. The entire class stared in a dead silence, the door creaking in a haunting invitation. I had never met her before. After five seconds of silence, my stomach turned.</p><p>I‚Äôm glad to have made the right decision. Had I never went after her, I would never have learned about her struggle with suicidal thoughts or past sexual abuse‚Äîand perhaps no one else would have. As we sat together in the hallways, tears streaming from her face, my tongue stumbling to find the right words, we built a friendship unlike any other. After countless late nights of listening, comforting, and encouraging her to seek professional help, she slowly yet miraculously recovered.</p><p>It is a privilege to have the opportunity to help so many students as president‚Äîbut a blessing to be there for someone in their greatest time of need. Since meeting my friend, I have cherished relationships through a different lens and that Dr. Seuss quote. I am fortunate enough to say ‚ÄúHi, how are you doing?‚Äù to hundreds every day, but knowing that some may hear those words only once, my words need to count. I&rsquo;m inspired by the greats, but driven by the grateful‚Äîand though my matrix multiplication is still a bit rusty from missing that math lecture, it was a small price to pay to find a life-changing friend and mission to serve others.</p><a href=#describe-a-mistake-you-made-or-a-challenge-you-faced-how-did-you-respond-to-that-mistake-or-challenge-and-what-did-you-learn-from-your-experience-><h2 id=describe-a-mistake-you-made-or-a-challenge-you-faced-how-did-you-respond-to-that-mistake-or-challenge-and-what-did-you-learn-from-your-experience-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Describe a Mistake You Made or a Challenge You Faced. How Did You Respond to That Mistake or Challenge, and What Did You Learn From Your Experience? *</h2></a><p>After months of planning for our student council Winter Formal as the dance chair and building contingency plans for almost every outcome, I was dealt a last-minute approval that was both the scariest and most exciting addition to the planning process: my crush said yes.</p><p>Honestly, most guys I know are way more prepared for no‚Äôs! My emotional roller coaster rolled from elation down to icy trepidation. What could I do to impress her? My trusted confidants had helped me all they could, and with only a week left, I had made plans for everything except myself. Then, I remembered my lead role in the elementary-school play, the hundreds of hours I had enjoyed investing, and it hit me: I would dance.</p><p>Relearning to dance was daunting, but my background and a few clever tricks in automation came to the rescue. Using a custom command-line script, I searched for and divided a dance routine into five-second videos. Every afternoon in front of the bathroom mirror, I would step and slide, drenched in sweat, until I mastered one video per day. By the week‚Äôs end, I had over a minute of original moves, permutations of which could last me hours. When the dance came, I killed it. To the cheers of the crowd, we danced the night away.</p><p>Today, the daily act of mastering something new has carried over into every aspect of my life. I have to-do lists, flashcards, and automated spreadsheets with blog articles, videos, and math problems to complete every day. From this experience, I developed the processes and love for learning that I will enjoy forever.</p><a href=#explain-the-reason-for-your-selection-><h2 id=explain-the-reason-for-your-selection-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Explain the Reason for Your Selection *</h2></a><p>‚ÄúTo be interesting, be interested.‚Äù</p><p>These five words have defined to me what it takes to be a student and leader. Having the honor of taking Mr. Mynster‚Äôs AP Statistics class, I have been truly inspired. Mr. Mynster is the embodiment of both parts of this quote‚Äîa man who is captivating having achieved so much, but also extraordinary with his compassion to help others.</p><p>Mr. Mynster possesses an immense intellect and is my role model as a student. He was accepted into Harvard University, yet chose UC Riverside for financial reasons. His belief that learning transcends education (like my grandmother) and anyone can be self-taught deeply resonated with me. Him being a self-taught programmer in ten languages and a self-studier of countless AP tests and even the bar exam (for fun), we share many lively discussions and similarities. He happily spent many hours outside class giving me advice about trading stocks, cracking jokes, introducing me to new technologies, and even inviting me to try a $1,200 VR headset. He is truly a ‚Äújack of all trades, master of many.‚Äù</p><p>The fact that Mr. Mynster teaches for fun and is willing to invest time in teaching his students is truly inspirational to me. His stocks as a savvy investor earn him ample money to make a living, but he considers teaching to be his serious hobby. Mr. Mynster is living proof that we can pursue our dreams, help others, and do the thing that we love‚Äîto be both interested and interesting. I am honored to be able to call him not only my teacher, but a mentor and friend who I aspire to be and will cherish for years to come.</p><p>Four years pass until I nervously enter the office of the Arcadia City Manager for the first time, my palms sticky with sweat, to discover the opportunity of a lifetime. Everything comes together. Hundreds of childhood hours wiring Arduino kits, building LEGO Mindstorm sets and PC&rsquo;s, and coding websites and Python programs could come together to code a new city inquiry website. My Coursera Business specialization came in handy to pitch new ideas, while ASB had prepared me to recruit and lead the student development team. Dozens of writing competitions had attuned me for writing letters. Watching everything click together to help the Arcadia community, I discover a newfound purpose.</p><a href=#please-write-an-essay-about-the-topic-in-your-essay-photograph-above-your-essay-should-demonstrate-style-depth-and-breadth-of-your-knowledge-and-individuality><h2 id=please-write-an-essay-about-the-topic-in-your-essay-photograph-above-your-essay-should-demonstrate-style-depth-and-breadth-of-your-knowledge-and-individuality><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Please Write an Essay About the Topic in Your Essay Photograph Above.

Her characters‚Äô mangled corpses litter the floor, her weapon still dripping with their blood after a flurry of violent strokes. As she curls into a little ball, I listen to her quiet sobs, trying to think of anything to say, but‚ÄîI cannot relate. I will never have to endure the pain of forgetting my mother tongue. Several minutes of empty silence pass before she looks up, tears welling in her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you speak Chinese?&rdquo; she asks.</p><p>I pause. In her glazed eyes I see only an empty reflection.</p><p>&ldquo;No, but‚Äî&rdquo;</p><p>I try to think of a smart reply. Something witty that could stick the landing. I need to look as smart as possible when answering the question‚Äîbecause I know I can only give the wrong one. But nothing I say will make the situation better. I give up.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated.&rdquo;</p><p>Her head bobs in defeat, tears raining upon the papers in silent disapproval. I move to interject.</p><p>There&rsquo;s too many things I wanted to say. We couldn&rsquo;t afford to go to China or have Chinese school when I was young. Mom is Mandarin, but Dad is Cantonese. Grandma and Grandpa lost their tongues before I could use mine.</p><p>I&rsquo;m fourth-generation Chinese.</p><p>Suddenly, I realize I&rsquo;m crying too.</p><hr><p>Growing up fourth-generation Chinese-American in a predominantly first-generation Chinese community, I am surrounded by immigrant stories. But while the immigrant&rsquo;s battle to assimilate can be as brief as a generation, the war to stay connected with their roots never ends. I learned the hard way that America lives for battles, but not wars‚Äîwhile everyone talked about the struggle to become American, few broached the struggle to stay Chinese. To them, answering ‚ÄúDo you speak Chinese?‚Äù was just a simple test. To me, it was a challenge: to find friends, assert myself, and discover a missing identity.</p><p>For the next few years, I stay up late nights with my father revising English essays, dreaming that I could turn knowing one language into a strength rather than weakness. I rise in early mornings with my mother for math problems. I learn coding languages, fantasizing that they could replace Chinese as my other tongues. While my friends spend trips immersed abroad and enlist in prep academies, I self-study, finding adventures in books and outdoor hikes and bike rides with what my family could afford. I begin signing up for competitions and enlisting in school clubs. Losing the one community I had made me eager to join every other one I could.</p><hr><p>The doors slam shut behind me with a frightening metallic thud as the student council president rapped her gavel, its sharp clang sealing my fate. It‚Äôs the first day of high school, and in a sea of fifty other candidates, I feel my heart thumping wildly as crimson-uniformed student council members surround us. There was no turning back now.</p><p>When the clipboard finally landed on my lap, still warm from passing through so many hands, my jaw dropped. I frantically flipped through the pages. Every freshman council position overflowed with names, except class president, where there was only one‚Äîthe incumbent and most popular candidate whom nobody dared oppose. I was hoping to run for a minor position‚Äîafter all, I had lost ten of eleven school elections, winning the last only because it took second place. There was no more consolation ‚ÄúRoom Representative‚Äù position if I lost. I closed my eyes and took a deep, shaking breath.</p><p>Not all moments are created equally. One decision often leads to thousands. I know because this, to run for president, would define the rest of my high school career.</p><p>Let‚Äôs go all in.</p><p>In two enthralling weeks, my social habits flipped. An underdog with nothing to lose and everything to gain, I jumped from hallway to hallway, listened to personal stories, and talked to hundreds of new students, enjoying the process of meeting someone new. From the football team at J building to the mathletes in Orchestra room, I didn‚Äôt just target those who felt connected, but those who didn‚Äôt‚Äîbecause to me, they might have been one of hundreds of interactions every day, but to them, I might have been the only one, and it needed to count. When results finally came‚Äîand I won‚ÄîI rejoiced.</p><p>Never had I imagined before the power of a single decision. One decision, to simply run and be interested, led to two enthralling weeks of campaigning beyond my comfort zone, meeting hundreds of new people, and finding a calling in service. One decision, to accept the challenge of president, led to years of new experiences, pushing boundaries of unprecedented scale, and seeing leadership through a new lens. Ultimately, one decision, to simply take a chance and push my limits, taught me that those chances are almost always worth taking.</p><p>This president‚Äôs gavel is the symbol of my journey to finding a community. An emblem of the power of a single decision. And a reminder of how much I have grown. Sometimes, you have to lose yourself to find yourself. And after many years of searching, I have found my calling in a life of service, and a family in the student council.</p><p>Today, as I walk down the hallways, Jasmine asks me for help in physics class, Saqif and his buddies talk about my recent all-school speech, Michelle&rsquo;s friend group chants my name, and I give warm hugs to the special-ed students in front of B106. None of these relationships were here three years ago, but built from scratch. I give one of my enormous signature smiles, glowing from cheek to cheek. On this campus, after thousands of hours studying in classrooms, hundreds planning with teams, and dozens performing on stage, I will always return to these hallways as my home, the conduits of genuine interest and care where my journey began. It isn&rsquo;t easy for one person to change the world, but in the halls of Arcadia High School, I aim to change the world for at least one person every day. As I dance down the hallways, greeting and asking others how their days are, I am reminded of how much I have grown‚Äîall thanks to one decision and some courageous counting.</p><hr><p>‚ÄúDo you speak Chinese?‚Äù</p><p>I just smile. There‚Äôs too many things I want to say.</p><p>I am fourth-generation Chinese. And I do not speak Chinese.</p><p>But I can code in 5 programming languages. I dutifully respond when my mother barks orders in Mandarin. I eat rice and dumplings and have a mad spice tolerance. And somehow, I‚Äôve turned my greatest weakness into a source of inspiration and strength. Perhaps it‚Äôs too hard to explain.</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs complicated.‚Äù</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3></h3><ul class=backlinks><li></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3></h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p></p><ul><li><a href=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/braden-w>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
