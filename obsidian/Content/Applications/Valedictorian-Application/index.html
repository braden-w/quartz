Office Number: 3. When I tell my friends some of my favorite ASB memories were trips to the assistant principal‚Äôs office, I have to reassure them I&rsquo;ve been a good kid. Dr. Tung‚Äôs office has been symbolic of my journey in ASB as a leader, from novice inductee to ASB President. Entering ASB with far less experience than my peers, my first month was the low point of my high school career. I made many mistakes and cried three times during Homecoming week, two of them in private conferences with Dr. Tung.</p><p>After several weeks, I mustered the strength to embrace a growth mindset and schedule an appointment. I would go to him, rather than have him come to me. Since then, I‚Äôve sought advice, stomached criticism, pitched ideas, given feedback‚Äîand turned my feared critic into most trusted mentor and friend.</p><p>Improving student-advisor relations. Resurrecting a school dance. Eating dinner together. Not only has ASB brought me closer to the school on every level from student to administrator, but it has provided me opportunities to push my boundaries, make unforgettable memories, and become a better student leader.</p><a href=#off-campus-activities-><h2 id=off-campus-activities-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Off Campus Activities *</h2></a><ol><li><p>Boy Scouts Of America, 7 years.

It became a mental crutch, and I failed tennis tryouts all 3 times. I was emotionally shattered. Having invested many hours of practice, I spent many days crying the next week.</p><p>I realized many days later that the pain, the ‚Äúwhat is,‚Äù subsided, but the suffering, the ‚Äúwhat if,‚Äù had not. In pain, you observe‚Äîmy leg hurts. But in suffering, you think‚ÄîI‚Äôll never walk the same way again.</p><p>I‚Äôm coping with losing my best friend vs. I‚Äôm going to be alone.</p><p>I have a headache vs. there‚Äôs something wrong with me.</p><p>I‚Äôm dealing with rejection vs. I‚Äôm not good enough.</p><p>I realized I could take back control of the narrative. I began exercising and became in the best shape of my life. Perhaps I was never meant to be part of the tennis team, and there is no silver lining in this story‚Äîinstead, I‚Äôm proud to have turned it into an opportunity to become stronger and develop grit.</p><p>Coding (in quarantine)</p><p>I created a clever automating program using Python, HTTP GET/POST, JSON, and Pocket API to batch delete entries by tag, saving huge time in my workflow.</p><p>I have also completed online courses:</p><p>Harvard CS50&rsquo;s Intro to Computer Science (rigorous 11-week course: data structures, memory mgmt, C, SQL, Python, etc. infamous for rapid pace, breadth, and difficult project-based psets), 11 days.</p><p>Google Cloud Engineering Professional 6-month Specialization(cloud infrastructure, services, scaling, automation, and exam prep), 8 days.</p><p>Stanford | Game Theory</p><p>Duke | Think Again: How to Understand Arguments</p><p>UC San Diego | Learning How to Learn</p><p>Osmosis | COVID-19 (CME Eligible)</p><p>Google Data Engineering Professional 6-month Specialization (Big Data, AI, Pipelines, Analytics, Warehouses, and exam prep), in progress.</p><a href=#work-experience><h2 id=work-experience><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Work Experience</h2></a><p>Intern at the Arcadia City Manager, 1 year.</p><p>I cold-emailed, sent a resume, and interviewed before becoming the first high school student intern. My most notable project was recruiting and leading a small student development team to hand-code a city inquiry website form, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a visually appealing frontend and working backend (a project which took about 100 hours). The form was designed to survey the city population for feedback before city council meetings.</p><a href=#essay-question><h2 id=essay-question><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Essay Question</h2></a><p>My decisions to run for student council, help someone new, and audition for the lead role in musical theater taught me an important lesson about leadership‚Äîthat one decision often leads to thousands, and we must relentlessly pursue those that push us to new heights.</p><p>(1) When I first decided to run for student council, I hoped to run for a minor position‚ÄîI lost four middle-school elections, winning the last because it took second place. But when the clipboard landed on my lap, my jaw dropped. Every freshman position overflowed except class president, where there was one‚Äîthe most popular candidate, the incumbent, whom nobody dared oppose. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.</p><p>3‚Ä¶2‚Ä¶1‚Ä¶</p><p>Let&rsquo;s go all in.</p><p>(2) I met one of my friends in a spectacular display‚Äîas she ran out the door, crying, during math class. The entire class stared, the door creaking in haunting invitation. I had never met her before. After a long silence, my stomach turned.</p><p>3‚Ä¶2‚Ä¶1‚Ä¶</p><p>I am grateful I made the right decision. Had I not went after her, I wouldn&rsquo;t have learned about her struggle with suicidal thoughts or past sexual abuse. As we sat in the hallways, tears streaming from her face, my tongue stumbling to find the words, we built a unique friendship. After many late nights of listening, comforting, and encouraging her to seek professional help, she recovered.</p><p>Since meeting my friend, I have cherished relationships through a different lens. I am fortunate to say ‚ÄúHi, how are you doing?‚Äù to hundreds every day, but knowing some may hear those words only once, my words need to count. I&rsquo;m inspired by the greats, but driven by the grateful‚Äîthough my matrix multiplication is still rusty from missing that math lecture, it&rsquo;s a small price to pay for a life-changing friend.</p><p>(3) When I decided to audition for the lead role for Musical Theater in 5th grade (I had 1 line in 4th grade), I set an ambitious goal that paid off. Musical theater not only taught me how to sing and dance, but confidence to dare to perform. I will cherish those early morning wakeups, line memorizing, and extra practices‚ÄîScott and his solo &ldquo;You Never Know&rdquo; will forever live in my heart.</p><p>It has not been talent, but the act of expressing interest, that created my greatest moments. From these three moments, I&rsquo;ve learned decision-making is at the heart of all leadership‚Äîand that we are all leaders, because our choices, starting from our choice to get up and be present, impact countless others every day. As I dance down the hallways, greeting and asking others how they&rsquo;re doing, I am reminded of how I have grown‚Äîall thanks to one decision and some courageous counting.</p><a href=#speech><h2 id=speech><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Speech</h2></a><ul><li><p>Story of Olympian in Village</p></li><li><p>Rational Optimism - Against the Tide</p></li><li><p>Biggest Problem?

Life, these events, they don‚Äôt happen to you, they happen for you.</p><p>In one of my favorite stories, a villager who dreamed of becoming an olympian announced to his village that he wanted to become an olympic diver, and at first? Everyone laughed at him. They told him he was ridiculous, that he would never get his dream. And at first, they seemed right.</p><p>But what else happens when you announce your dream to the entire world? The best coaches start knocking on your door. The right trainers offer contracts. The right team is formed. The right mindset is born. He was right to believe, because he reached the olympics. Do not be afraid to share your dreams. I‚Äôm not going to lie. People might doubt you. People might laugh at you. But it is the only way people will know to help you. You will never achieve more than your greatest ambition.</p><p>People often ask me why I am so optimistic, and I point to this story and a simple sentence:</p><p>History remembers those who believe in the future.</p><p>Optimism does not need to be an ignorance to face facts or cowardice to face reality just to fake a smile.</p><p>Optimsm a belief that you have control over your future ‚Äî and that you will make it better.</p><p>Visionaries will spend years going against the grain doubted by their fellow villagers, before seeing any returns on their vision or being proved correct. Steve Jobs was fired from his company for 12 years. Elon Musk spent 2008 on the verge of bankruptcy as SpaceX‚Äôs went 0‚Äì3 in its first launches and Tesla ‚Äúhemorrhaged money.‚Äù But look now. Just like our diver, the world is led by optimists not because they lie or lead others astray, but because their belief, their convictions, create alternate realities, unique from the status quo, something to believe in, that bring the best in others.</p><p>If you don‚Äôt believe in the future, why should you lead?</p><p>To execute your vision, you need ‚Äúrational optimism‚Äù and something for people to believe in.</p><p>The quality of your life is not defined by the quantity of your successes but by the quality of your problems, and questions you ask yourself. What‚Äôs your biggest problem you‚Äôre currently solving right now?</p><p>If it‚Äôs ‚ÄúHow do I get the minimum points to pass this class and graduate,‚Äù I know enough. ‚ÄúHow do I beat Apple.‚Äù I know enough. ‚ÄúHow do I provide a product so revolutionary, that no consumer . Nobody was ever thinking an iPhone until they saw an iPhone.</p><p>Ask the biggest questions. I ask</p><p>We don‚Äôt progress to fewer problems, we progress to bigger ones.</p><p>Remove uncertainty.

Your ambition is the hard limit, because it is when you choose to stop, not the environment chooses to stop you.</p><p>The question may be uncomfortable, but hopefully clarifies what I mean by ‚Äúoptimism.‚Äù It is not rooted in always ‚Äúlooking on the bright side‚Äù or wearing rose-tinted glasses ‚Äî but building an
