What Type of Environment Helps You Succeed?</h3></a><p>I love enabling others and building a culture that breeds transparency, trust, and enthusiasm. I enjoy delegating not just tasks, but problems‚Äîthis gives others pride, ownership, and the autonomy to create and handle tasks in novel ways. When I served on student council, this principle was essential: when leading a team of 43 students serving almost 3,500 constituents, there is no time to micromanage, and trust must be established to divide and conquer tasks.</p><p>On a more individual note, I love building things. It started out with Legos, but programming is an entirely different beast‚Äîit allows one to create a living tangible product, one that breathes and responds to every change, until you get it just right. These moments, of immense clarity and euphoria, are what I live for.</p><p>And finally, I love rapid pace. I love the feeling having having coding docs open, along with 20 other tabs, scrambling to find a solution for a new feature. I love decentralized command, where each individual is empowered to make decisions for the betterment of the team. I enjoy being trusted, depended on, to deliver new features.</p><p>Any environment which iterates rapidly, grants autonomy, and delegates will be one that I will find myself comfortable in.</p><a href=#q2-describe-a-time-when-you-demonstrated-your-creativity-and-resourcefulness-need-not-be-a-work-experience-it-can-be-with-anything><h3 id=q2-describe-a-time-when-you-demonstrated-your-creativity-and-resourcefulness-need-not-be-a-work-experience-it-can-be-with-anything><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Q2: Describe a Time When You Demonstrated Your Creativity and Resourcefulness (need Not Be a Work Experience, it Can Be with anything).</h3></a><p>As the clipboard landed on my lap, my jaw dropped. Every position overflowed with names, except class president, where there was one‚Äîthe most popular candidate, the incumbent, whom nobody dared oppose. I closed my eyes, and took a deep breath.</p><p>3‚Ä¶2‚Ä¶1‚Ä¶</p><p>The decision to run for class president was the most defining decision I made in high school. Today, I am still amazed by how this one leap of faith completely changed the trajectory of my life‚Äîhow it led to two enthralling weeks of campaigning, a surprise victory, and four years of unforgettable memories and experiences. I am also amazed because it was something I never imagined that I would do. As I sat in that candidate meeting, I probably had one of the lowest election win-rates. I had lost four out of my five previous middle-school campaigns, winning the last only because it took the top two and I finished second. On the first day of school, I stayed behind for the student council meeting not because I thought I could win‚Äîfar from it‚Äîbut because I didn&rsquo;t know who to eat with during lunch. All of my close friends from middle school had moved away.</p><p>The single most defining moment of my high school career did not happen when I won anything, when I was most proud, or when I was in the spotlight. Instead, it happened when I was most vulnerable, alone, and nobody was watching. Because that is what it took for me to venture beyond my comfort zone.</p><p>It was through jumping into the deep end that I forced myself to innovate, to be resourceful, and take risks. During my campaign, I had to learn how to socialize without having been particularly social. During ASB, I had to learn how to become a leader without having been a leader‚Äîat least, not at that scale. It was challenging. I was definitely really awkward in the beginning when approaching new groups, but gradually learned that I love creating and sharing moments with others. I definitely had many leadership weaknesses at first, but I adopted a growth mindset and listened to my advisors until I was competent enough to advise others. I&rsquo;ve learned that one decision leads to thousands, and decision-making is at the heart of all leadership‚Äîand that we are all leaders, because our choices, starting with the decision to get up and be present every morning, impact countless others every day.</p><p>I know this question asks about how I demonstrated creativity and resourcefulness, but my answer is more about how I got there, and how I will continue getting there in the future. I love taking risks and pushing my boundaries, because it forces me to adapt and enables creativity and resourcefulness. I hope to continue taking risks in the future.</p><a href=#q3-what-problems-are-important-to-you-how-have-you-solved-or-how-do-you-see-yourself-solving-them><h3 id=q3-what-problems-are-important-to-you-how-have-you-solved-or-how-do-you-see-yourself-solving-them><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Q3: What Problems Are Important to You? How Have You Solved or How Do You See Yourself Solving Them?</h3></a><p>In a team, when I&rsquo;m leading, I ask myself the following questions:</p><p>How can I foster a community of trust, transparency, and openness?</p><p>How can create a culture where my peers are excited to come and work together every day?</p><p>How can I start with why, and create a compelling mission for others to buy into?</p><p>How can make sure that everyone feels valued?</p><p>How can I ensure that our team would pass the &ldquo;School Bus Test&rdquo;‚Äîif I were to be hit by a school bus the next day, would our team have the culture to continue to thrive even without my leadership?</p><p>If I am in a leadership position, these problems are ultimately solved through me. I assume extreme ownership of the well-being of my teammates, because I believe leadership is the difference maker, and the importance of good leadership in a team cannot be understated. Good leadership will inspire and enable others to perform beyond their wildest expectations.</p><p>In a team, regarding performance:</p><p>How can I iterate on this idea more quickly?</p><p>How can I get immediate feedback, whether from my leader or customer?</p><p>Most failures are one-time costs, while most regrets are recurring costs. How can I minimize regret and maximize satisfaction with what I do?</p><p>I proactively seek feedback while on a team, because resolving these questions leads to improved performance.</p><p>Individually, some problems I&rsquo;m interested in working on, both now and in the future:</p><p>Creating communities: How can I foster new communities that help others feel more connected with the world?</p><p>Education: How can I help democratize information and increase educational engagement with the disengaged?</p><p>How can I better understand real estate and help serve those who are unable to find affordable housing? (On a personal note, how can I help my grandparents, as they manage some real estate properties?)</p><p>How can I identify and work towards managing/solving existential risks? For example, disruptive applications of AI, AI Safety, nuclear deescalation, global priorities research, etc..</p><p>Ultimately, nothing brings me more joy than helping others pursue even bigger problems. I define my life not by the quantity of my successes, but the quality of my problems. As we advance, we do not deal with fewer problems, but bigger ones. Our lives will be defined by the scope of problems we choose to tackle. After all, why do we define others through &ldquo;first-world problems&rdquo; and not &ldquo;first-world successes&rdquo;? We revere visionaries because they were bold enough to dare to tackle problems that many of us never imagined or attempted. I would like to tackle large and broad problems, to maximize my impact.</p><a href=#q4-write-a-short-intro-for-yourself-in-the-third-person-if-you-are-paired-with-a-start-up-well-send-your-response-to-this-question-as-an-introduction-try-to-keep-it-within-3-to-4-sentences><h3 id=q4-write-a-short-intro-for-yourself-in-the-third-person-if-you-are-paired-with-a-start-up-well-send-your-response-to-this-question-as-an-introduction-try-to-keep-it-within-3-to-4-sentences><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Q4: Write a Short Intro for Yourself in the Third-person.

In fact, in addition to weekly video calls with my friends, my coding buddies and I have flirted with different app ideas for connecting both during and after COVID. Dex was literally one of our random app ideas‚Äîan app that would send reminders to check in with your friends‚Äîand so to be a part of this project would be awesome!</p><p>Additionally, I tried out Dex and have been blown away. Unlike many apps, Dex is intuitive and fits into my workflow, and I am increasingly adopting it to manage my relationships. Its seamlessness and integration with websites, external services, .csv files, and the browser is a joy to study. Even better, I inspected the website and detected Nuxt.js, which is the same framework I use for my side projects. The HTML classes used resemble those used in Tailwind CSS and Vuetify, the former of which I am familiar with, and the latter I have used extensively in my projects. I could learn so much from working with their codebase, and that absolutely excites me!</p><p>To Dex, I hope to bring genuine excitement from my alignment with their mission statement, as well as specialization and understanding of their tech stack. I am excited to become part of their team, and gain invaluable experience in how to understand, develop, and manage a seamless experience for users with the Vue.js/Nuxt.js tech stack.</p><a href=#q-what-positions-eg-marketing-software-development-product-management-would-you-want-to-work-in-most><h3 id=q-what-positions-eg-marketing-software-development-product-management-would-you-want-to-work-in-most><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Q: What position(s) (e.g. Marketing, Software Development, Product Management) Would You Want to Work in Most?</h3></a><p>I love building things, and so a technical position such as front-end, quality assurance, or software development would be most ideal!
