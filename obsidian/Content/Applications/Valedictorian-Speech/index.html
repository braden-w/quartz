I am excited to be here, and it is a great honor to be representing you as Valedictorian. As four years of friendship, challenges, and memories come to a close, coronavirus has indelibly impacted our lives. I wish we could be walking on that stage, taking pictures together, signing yearbooks, receiving our diplomas, hugging, laughing, crying.</p><p>But today, we are still graduating.</p><p>We are still part of a global community of students wrapping up a chapter of their lives.</p><p>We are still starting new adventures that will lead us down so many different exciting roads.</p><p>We are still the class of 2020.</p><p>Hindsight may be 2020, but today, 2020 is the future. In the spirit of 2020 vision, I would like to share these words: what we do in darkness is what makes us shine in the light.</p><p>Because our greatest moments, the moments that defined us, that brought us here, were not in the light, but in darkness.</p><p>I‚Äôm talking about the quiet hours we spent at the library studying for exams. The relentless all-nighters we grinded away to finish those assignments the day before they were due. The countless sessions we spent practicing our craft, our talents, our passions. The nights we spent comforting our friends in their darkest hours.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not talking about when we were on stage and everyone was watching, but when we were alone and nobody was. When we were practicing. Taking risks. Pushing ourselves to the limit.</p><p>Four years ago on the first day of school, I made a decision to visit the student council freshman candidate meeting. One decision led to thousands, and one decision, not to run, but to simply interested, changed my entire life.</p><p>Today, you may see me in light as your student council president, but you might not see the full picture.</p><p>You might not know that before that decision, I lost four of five elections in a row in middle school, and I won the last one only because they took second place.</p><p>You might not know that until that moment, I never planned to run for high school ASB, and never in my wildest dreams did I imagine running for president.</p><p>And none of you know that I didn‚Äôt join that informational meeting because I felt confident, but because I felt lonely.</p><p>Because several of my buddies had just transferred to different schools and I, being a new freshman in a completely new high school environment, didn‚Äôt know who to sit with for lunch.</p><p>The single most defining moment of my high school career wasn‚Äôt when I won anything. It wasn‚Äôt when I was most proud. And it wasn‚Äôt when I was in the spotlight. Instead, it was when I was most vulnerable. When I was alone. When nobody was watching. Because that is what it took for me to take a chance beyond my comfort zone.</p><p>So what do I mean when I say what we do in darkness makes us shine in the light?</p><p>We don‚Äôt like darkness, but we know everyone is defined by it. We don&rsquo;t see darkness, but we know everyone faces it. But these moments of darkness, of challenge, defined our journey rather than ended it. Now, we are standing in the light, so let us recognize with 20/20 vision, the hard work and devotion, of our family, of our friends, and of ourselves, that brought us here. And as we gear up to face a world with new challenges, let us continue reshaping our vision as we look through these three lenses to see through the darkness and into the light.</p><ol><li>To be interesting, be interested.</li></ol><p>The quality that will bring us our best moments won‚Äôt necessarily be talent or even hard work, but the act of simply expressing interest and finding new opportunities.</p><p>Imagine if your success rate was 20%. If you try once, the chance you fail is 80%. But if you try 100 times, what&rsquo;s the probability you fail all 100 times? .00000002%. In other words, your chance of success is practically 100%. And one success can make all the other failures worth it. But how do you ever get to try 100 times? By being interested. By finding more opportunities. By being unphased when faced with failure. You can improve your percentage by working hard, by being talented, sure, but nothing beats trying more often.</p><ol start=2><li>The biggest risk is not taking any.</li></ol><p><a class="internal-link broken">If You Live Your Entire Life Trying to Minimize Failure, Then You Will Never Maximize Success</a>. As author James Clear once said, failure is a one-time cost, while regret is a recurring cost. The pain of inaction stings far longer than the pain of incorrect action. Take risks, take chances, and you won‚Äôt regret it.</p><ol start=3><li>History remembers those who believe in the future.</li></ol><p>You need optimism, drive, grit, to power through hardship and give others something to believe in. If you don‚Äôt believe in the future, why should you lead? You will never solve more than your greatest problem, and you will never achieve more than your greatest ambition. So reach for the stars.</p><p>In conclusion, let us, the class of 2020, open our eyes, bring light from darkness, and see the many opportunities around us. As slam poet In-Q once said, ‚Äúyou&rsquo;re not going through it, it&rsquo;s going through you.‚Äù We control the narrative and what these events mean to us, meaning these events don‚Äôt happen to us, they happen for us&ndash;for us to see through the right 2020 lens and turn into our greatest accomplishments. The world has given us darkness, but that is not a bad thing, because we are the light that will shine through. Congratulations, happy graduation, and best of luck to Arcadia High School class of 2020!</p><a href=#junk><h2 id=junk><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Junk</h2></a><p>We will not just be resilient in the face of danger, because resilience is based off our breaking point; we will not be tempered, because even tempered things shatter; no&ndash;we will bend, we will roll, we will be shatterproof, unshakeable, antifragile, because we are never going to break.</p><p>Nobody sees your failures, only your successes, but that should be the most liberating feeling of all. You have complete freedom to fail. Do not make people extraordinary as an excuse not to succeed. Many of you have seen me in my highs. Some of you have seen me in my lows. But none of you, except my family, have seen me in the times of despair.</p><p>But don‚Äôt expect a silver lining in failure.</p><p>I wish I could tell you that life is fair. It is not. You do not have to remember your failures, because frankly, nobody else will.</p><p>If I told you I could practically guarantee you anything if you tried 100 times, would you do it? The problem, then, is not trying enough, but finding a problem that is worth trying for.</p><a href=#chinese-club-write-up><h2 id=chinese-club-write-up><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chinese Club Write Up</h2></a><ol><li>To be interesting, be interested. The quality that will bring you your best moments won‚Äôt be talent or even hard work, but the act of simply expressing interest and finding new opportunities.</li></ol><p>Imagine if your success rate was 20%. If you try once, the chance you fail is 80%. But if you try 100 times, the probability you fail all 100 times is 00000002%. In other words, your chance of at least one success is practically 100%. And one success can make all the other failures worth it.</p><p>Many talented students have a success rate far greater than 20%, but they never try enough times to see results manifest. In order to try 100 times, you must be interested in finding more opportunities. You can improve your percentage by working hard and cultivating talent, sure, but nothing beats trying more often. Effort, especially in seeking opportunities, is the ultimate equalizer in high school.</p><ol start=2><li>The biggest risk is not taking any.</li></ol><p>If you live your entire life trying to minimize failure, then you will never maximize success. As author James Clear once said, failure is a one-time cost, while regret is a recurring cost. The pain of inaction stings far longer than the pain of incorrect action.</p><p>Many students in high school suffer from the &ldquo;spotlight effect,&rdquo; or the belief that they are being noticed more than they really are, especially after failure. This is not the case. Chances are that nobody cares about your failures (especially compared to how much you care). Most students are too worried about their personal lives to be thinking about the tiny slip-ups other people made. This isn&rsquo;t bad, but amazing. The fact that most people aren&rsquo;t thinking about you is perhaps the most liberating aspect of high school‚Äîyou have freedom to take risks, take chances, and you won&rsquo;t regret it.</p><ol start=3><li>History remembers those who believe in the future.</li></ol><p>You need optimism, drive, grit, to power through hardship and give others something to believe in.
