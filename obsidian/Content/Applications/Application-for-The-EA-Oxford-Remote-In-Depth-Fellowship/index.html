Currently the youngest and only freshman fellow. We hold weekly (sometimes biweekly) discussions with assigned readings.</p><p>EAGx Virtual Weekend
<a href=https://www.eaglobal.org/events/eagxvirtual2020/ rel=noopener>https://www.eaglobal.org/events/eagxvirtual2020/</a> (3 Days, 18 hours): Engaged in 1-on-1 calls and seminars on EA topics, specifically in artificial intelligence. The experiences in EAGxVirtual and Yale EA Fellowship, specifically, have allowed me to meet individuals from many countries and gain a deeper understanding of the global scope of EA.</p><a href=#what-would-you-say-is-the-biggest-way-the-effective-altruism-community-is-currently-going-wrong><h2 id=what-would-you-say-is-the-biggest-way-the-effective-altruism-community-is-currently-going-wrong><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What Would You Say is the Biggest Way the Effective Altruism Community is Currently Going Wrong?</h2></a><p>Accessibility.</p><p>I believe Effective Altruism&rsquo;s emphasis on neglectedness, while essential to the ITN framework, has at times bordered myopic and proved detrimental to its expansion and accessibility to mainstream audiences. This is more noticeable in several instances, where in my opinion, EA failed to leverage mainstream cause areas as opportunities to widen its global audience.</p><p>As an example, EA&rsquo;s early lack of attention on climate change as a low-neglectedness cause area may have discouraged members from engaging in the climate change discussion, an opportunity which proved especially costly when the topic was ubiquitous in the 2017 news cycle after President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords. The fact I cannot find any Effective Altruist article regarding this topic, while understandable, is disheartening. I would argue that these instances have alienated EA to an extent and unfortunately, prevented many of its other unique propositions from entering mainstream discussion. While EA has since evolved and given the topic some degree of coverage, it would have been better if this shift occurred earlier.</p><p>To be clear, I completely agree with the core concept of neglectedness and many EA values. In fact, considering I align with Effective Altruism values, it is surprising I had not discovered Effective Altruism earlier. However, perhaps this is because accessibility is more correlated to cause area alignment rather than framework alignment. I believe EA needs to be more aggressive in its expansion into mainstream cause areas to allow itself to introduce its neglected ones. Cause areas should not only be evaluated based off the scale and tractability they possess, but the scale and traction they provide to EA as a growing movement.</p><p>Recently, I think EA has made a great step in the right direction. For example, I believe Effective Altruism&rsquo;s current stance in AI ethics is a great move, as while Artificial Intelligence is an incredibly popular topic with rapid growth, the topic of Artificial Intelligence ethics is a unique stance where EA provides a distinct value add. In addition, the prevalence of pandemic preparedness has validated many of EA&rsquo;s previous claims. While I do not advocate EA to gloat with an &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;, I believe the EA community should capitalize on the status quo to grow its movement and diversify.</p><p>Ideally, this would also help EA expand its diversity and presence. For example, in California, the Bay Area of Northern . While affluent , the nature of the demographic may alienate . This demographic in the Bay Area should not necessarily be a microcosm of the Effective Altruism</p><a href=#what-are-you-hoping-to-get-out-of-the-fellowship><h2 id=what-are-you-hoping-to-get-out-of-the-fellowship><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What Are You Hoping to Get Out of the Fellowship?</h2></a><p>I have truly enjoyed the depth of discussion Yale EA members have consistently been able to provide, especially in the current Yale fellowship. Though I realize I am on the younger side of the average EA member, I hope to contribute through thoughtful synthesis and incorporating reading materials into our discussions. If this fellowship has a similar level of organization and depth, I will definitely enjoy it.</p><a href=#short-bio><h2 id=short-bio><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Short Bio</h2></a><p>Student drawn to tackling ethics, education, and economic development with artificial intelligence and computer science. In particular, I hope to tackle the scarcity mindset, an issue that I believe is both neglected and keeping many citizens from engaging with global issues (and potential EA topics).</p><p>It is very difficult to worry about the world when your livelihood is under direct threat. As a Chinese proverb goes, ‚ÄúWhen there is food on the table there are many problems. When there is no food on the table there is one problem‚Äù.</p><p>According to a recent survey from Charles Schwab, 59% of Americans live from paycheck to paycheck. That means for many individuals, the biggest problem they will ever get to tackle is how to get food on the table, keep their job, or secure the next check. I believe the scarcity mindset introduced in this difficult lifestyle has led to a lack of <a class="internal-link broken">Political</a> engagement and hyperpartisanship.</p><p>It is very possible to feel disgruntled when listening to rich politicians criticize why you aren&rsquo;t caring enough about global issues when your mental bandwidth is occupied with your survival. It is also easier for a politician to convince you to scapegoat, whether it be immigrants, billionaires, or otherwise.</p><p>I&rsquo;m interested in destroying this mindset, economically or otherwise, and encouraging free thought and education across the world. Hopefully, this has the potential to grow the accessibility of EA topics across the globe.</p><p>I enjoy deep discussions about any topic and am happy to share any resources that may be worth your time. I am freshman at Yale University and prospective Economics & Computer Science and/or Data Science & Statistics major.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3></h3><ul class=backlinks><li></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3></h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p></p><ul><li><a href=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/></a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/braden-w>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
