I‚Äôm Braden, a referral from Cian and incoming freshman to Yale University planning to double major in Economics & CS and Statistics & Data Science. Cian and I had a fascinating conversation yesterday on economics, AI, and Effective Altruism, and he recommended that I reach out to you and apply for Patch!</p><p>I just had a quick question: at Patch, is there room for longer-term research projects/roadmaps/advocacy, or is there a stronger emphasis on MVPs and rapid growth? I‚Äôm very impressed by the program and would love to be a part of it, but I also want to make sure that my ideas can serve you and the program‚Äôs mission.</p><p>I have a project that I am quite passionate about, but it is more so a vision for the future than a specific project (it may be accomplished through advocacy, projects, etc., but requires direction). Would it be acceptable if I fleshed this out in my application, or would it be safer to go with an app idea?</p><p>Regardless, I just wanted to express how awesome I believe the work you‚Äôre doing is. I heard you‚Äôre working with a startup providing 25% of COVID tests in California, which is super rad (I‚Äôm from southern California :) ) Thank you so much for your time!</p><a href=#online-presence-><h2 id=online-presence-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Online Presence *</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/braden-wong/ rel=noopener>https://www.linkedin.com/in/braden-wong/</a> (LinkedIn),

I competed nationally in math, writing, speech & debate, and business in high school and took several risks that led me to becoming student council president and valedictorian. I love self-studying and improving myself! In quarantine, I&rsquo;m developing my technical skills. I‚Äôm an incoming freshman to Yale University planning to double major in Economics & CS and Statistics & Data Science.</p><a href=#tell-us-about-a-time-you-did-something-outside-the-box-it-can-be-anything-><h2 id=tell-us-about-a-time-you-did-something-outside-the-box-it-can-be-anything-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Tell Us About a Time You Did Something Outside the Box. It Can Be Anything! *</h2></a><p>Running for freshman student council. I hoped to run for a minor position, having lost four of five elections in middle school (I won the last only because it took second place). But when the clipboard landed on my lap, every position overflowed except president, where there was only the most popular candidate, the incumbent, whom nobody dared oppose. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.</p><p>One decision led to thousands, and one decision‚Äîto take a chance beyond my comfort zone‚Äîchanged my life.</p><a href=#describe-one-major-challenge-you-have-faced-and-how-you-overcame-it-><h2 id=describe-one-major-challenge-you-have-faced-and-how-you-overcame-it-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Describe One Major Challenge You Have Faced, and How You Overcame It. *</h2></a><p>Though I was a precocious tennis player, a recurring hip injury became a mental crutch, and I failed tennis tryouts all 3 times. Having invested many hours of practice, I was emotionally shattered.</p><p>Slowly, I realized pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional. I took back control of the narrative, and exercised into the best shape of my life. Perhaps I was never meant to be part of the tennis team, and sometimes there is no silver lining in failure‚Äîbut I&rsquo;ve become much stronger in return.</p><a href=#what-projects-have-you-worked-on-so-far-if-you-have-won-any-awards-or-have-done-any-work-you-are-proud-of-please-include-that-too-><h2 id=what-projects-have-you-worked-on-so-far-if-you-have-won-any-awards-or-have-done-any-work-you-are-proud-of-please-include-that-too-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What Projects Have You Worked on so Far?

Solves problems like &ldquo;I want to spend >x hours reading&rdquo; or &ldquo;&lt;y hours on YouTube&rdquo; per week. User allocates # of hours per activity per week (default 168 hours &ldquo;free time&rdquo;), and the app timer counts the current activity towards the budget (default &ldquo;free time). It&rsquo;s a dashboard with horizontal digital hourglasses.
