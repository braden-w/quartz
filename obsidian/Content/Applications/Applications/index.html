Outstanding test scores tend to have that effect on someone‚Äôs ego. Trust me, it gets better, and it gets worse. Through one single decision, your entire introverted life is about to be flipped over. You will find yourself in a completely new environment, which will expose almost all of your weaknesses but also all of your strengths. Truthfully, your past will no longer matter. There is only one phrase you must remember at all times: this too, shall pass.</p><p>No matter what the context is, or how happy or sad you may feel, time will move on. There will be times in which you will have complete control, and times in which you will feel completely helpless. Fortunately, you do not control the past or future, so do not stress over what has passed or what is yet to come. Instead, focus on the present, for that writes both the history books and tomorrow&rsquo;s decisions. The moments you find the most ephemeral now will create the memories that are the most everlasting later. Use it well.</p><p>Despite what is coming, the protagonist of our little story will not receive intervention. It is because I love you that I will not reveal too much, steer you clear of pain, or provide an easy way out. Frankly, there are twists down the road that are painful or pleasurable only if you do not know what‚Äôs coming next. There are challenges you must face alone and lessons you must learn the hard way in your darkest hours. But your journey will be the greatest story of all time, of a man who slowly unearths the power to acknowledge and the knowledge to empower. And of all the gifts to come your way, may you remember that you have been endowed with the greatest gift of all‚Äî</p><p>Trust.</p><p>It will take faith. It will make pain. But as Steve Jobs said, ‚Äú<a class="internal-link broken">You can‚Äôt connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards.</a>‚Äù You‚Äôll see why soon.</p><a href=#describe-a-characteristic-about-yourself-that-you-think-should-be-improved-and-what-you-would-do-to-change-it><h2 id=describe-a-characteristic-about-yourself-that-you-think-should-be-improved-and-what-you-would-do-to-change-it><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Describe a Characteristic About Yourself That You Think Should Be Improved and What You Would Do to Change it</h2></a><p>I plan on improving my confidence! Confidence conveys decisiveness and importantly, helps people feel safe. If I want to establish a team culture that is inclusive, where people are unafraid to give and receive honest feedback, it starts with me‚Äîto unconditionally demonstrate belief in them and myself!</p><p>I have learned that confidence is a matter of daily habit. For example, practicing a 5-minute impromptu speech every morning makes all the difference for my public speaking. Even 1 second of daily practice is infinitely times better than 0‚Äîbecause one second is improvement, zero is atrophy. Having a chain of successful habits builds an unshakeable confidence from constant tangible experiences. That gives me an advantage‚Äìbecause I have 5 minutes of extra practice on anybody in that room, for any given day. To gain confidence, I will maintain my central habit of waking up early before 5 AM to practice and gain a distinct early advantage every single day.</p><a href=#smw-members-often-visit-elementary-schools-for-read-across-america-events-if-you-had-to-pick-a-favorite-childhood-book-to-read-to-younger-children-which-one-would-it-be-and-why><h2 id=smw-members-often-visit-elementary-schools-for-read-across-america-events-if-you-had-to-pick-a-favorite-childhood-book-to-read-to-younger-children-which-one-would-it-be-and-why><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>SMW Members Often Visit Elementary Schools for Read Across America Events. If You Had to Pick a Favorite Childhood Book to Read to Younger Children, Which One Would it Be and Why?</h2></a><p>I would probably read the students a book from the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series! The books are not only well-known, but incredibly funny and a caricature of middle school life. They are particularly fitting, especially for 5th graders, because they demonstrate some aspects of middle school life before they start their middle school careers. On a side note, for younger students, I may choose Charlotte‚Äôs Web instead, as I have incredibly fond memories of reading with my mom when I was very young and would like to share a similar experience with those students.</p><a href=#create-an-action-plan-for-a-service-project-or-event-that-has-yet-to-be-done-at-arcadia-high-school-why-did-you-choose-this-projectevent-and-what-does-it-mean-to-you><h2 id=create-an-action-plan-for-a-service-project-or-event-that-has-yet-to-be-done-at-arcadia-high-school-why-did-you-choose-this-projectevent-and-what-does-it-mean-to-you><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Create an Action Plan for a Service Project or Event That Has yet to Be Done at Arcadia High School. Why Did You Choose This project/event and What Does it Mean to You?</h2></a><p>I believe that school organizations could benefit from a massive consolidation of knowledge into repositories and documents. In clubs, teams, and ASB, I have noticed that almost every organization uses different suppliers for very similar materials, the most notorious one being clothing, fruit snacks, and lychee jellies. Since the goods are identical but the prices can be drastically different, I envision us sharing information of our different suppliers and current inventories, so that future purchases choose the most cost-effective sources and organizations can borrow resources from each other to avoid excess inventory. I value knowledge, and sharing it is a legacy that will benefit numerous organizations for years to come, especially the ones I‚Äôm part of now. The procedure is simple, but not easy‚Äîcreate, then share. A brief action plan outline of the project would be as follows:</p><ol><li>Create a document or repository that is capable of accommodating different types of suppliers/information.</li><li>Organize them so that each one is specifically designated for clothing suppliers, food suppliers, etc..</li><li>Reach out to organizational leadership to add information into said documents.</li><li>First, have ASB create said document. They likely have the most diverse set of suppliers, especially among their 4 class councils, and can use this existing information to encourage other organizations to add to it.</li><li>Disseminate to clubs through ICC meetings</li><li>To academic teams in team captain meetings</li><li>Reach out to teacher organizations/administration, as they also have suppliers</li><li>To any other organizations through other means (LINK, SMW, etc.)</li><li>Create structure for long-term maintenance</li><li>ASB is probably the most reliable organization for this job but can be loaded upon SMW as well</li><li>Through the documents that outline steps for successors, include the steps for this process to be replicated in the future.</li></ol><p>The most important aspect is communication. The project is ambitious and difficult because not every organization may see an immediate benefit or reason to add their tips in. In this case, 100% participation, especially among clubs, is not a necessity but a luxury. However, information is always good for the consumer, and potential savings from such a project can be enormous. When a powerful organization such as ASB or SMW starts the chain by filling the list first with dozens of resources, it is safe to assume other organizations will see tangible benefits and consider joining. Organization will be key, but it‚Äôs definitely worth a shot with a huge payoff in the long run.</p><a href=#you-are-at-a-volunteering-event-and-are-asked-to-speak-about-the-importance-of-service-and-your-leadership-role-in-smw-what-would-you-say><h2 id=you-are-at-a-volunteering-event-and-are-asked-to-speak-about-the-importance-of-service-and-your-leadership-role-in-smw-what-would-you-say><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>You Are at a Volunteering Event and Are Asked to Speak About the Importance of Service and Your Leadership Role in SMW. What Would You Say?</h2></a><ol start=6><li>My regard for service is simple‚Äîit is the tangible connection between an individual and the community. The flow of service, however, is the opposite of the norm. While communities directly benefit practically all of their individuals, how many individuals directly benefit their communities? The answer is only an elite few‚Äîbut those individuals make all the difference, through targeted and motivated service.</li></ol><p>Everyone is a leader. The moment you wake up from bed, you have led through making a decision, a choice that affects not just you but everyone else you will meet for that day, just for choosing to be present. Leadership is decision making, and leadership is for all of us.</p><p>My role in SMW is the same as anybody else in this room. I lead by example, for an audience that is always watching: myself. The service and smiles that follows is the bonus, and the best reward.</p><a href=#what-is-your-pet-peeve-and-why><h2 id=what-is-your-pet-peeve-and-why><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What is Your Pet Peeve and Why?</h2></a><p>I don‚Äôt generally have a pet peeve, but I find it incredibly difficult to deal with complete carelessness. There‚Äôs a difference between being easy-going and being utterly careless‚ÄîI enjoy spending time with people who go with the flow, but to just not care about anything can often create a poor friend and colleague. If you care about at least something, then we can work from there‚Äîin fact, when I lead, I appreciate diversity of values because it provides adaptability when united under a common banner‚Äîbut if you don‚Äôt care about anything, and have no values, how can I trust you to care about our relationship or our team? I‚Äôll do my best and rise to the challenge, but generally, it is incredibly difficult to lead or have meaningful relationships with such individuals.</p><a href=#what-is-your-strongest-trait-and-describe-a-time-which-you-demonstrated-this-trait-to-be-a-leader><h2 id=what-is-your-strongest-trait-and-describe-a-time-which-you-demonstrated-this-trait-to-be-a-leader><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What is Your Strongest Trait and Describe a Time Which You Demonstrated This Trait to Be a Leader</h2></a><p>My strongest ability is grit and ability to learn from failure. I am consistent, willing to take risks, and especially wiling to hold on when the going gets tough. My belief is that it doesn&rsquo;t matter where you came from‚Äîonly where you want to end up, and your willingness to suffer to get there.</p><p>In leadership, dealing with failure is the truest test. Success in leadership breeds respect, but it is often failure that breeds the greatest trust. After poor planning in my Boy Scouts troop during a snow sports trip, our two groups got separated. Ultimately, it was because some scouts had been selfish and wanted to move faster than the second group. We all knew what went wrong. But when I gathered all the scouts to reflect on the activity, I didn‚Äôt point fingers. Instead, I took responsibility for as many aspects as possible‚Äìthough I had little directly to do with the separation, as the troop leader, I explained I was ultimately responsible for the safety of all my fellow scouts. This immediately broke the tension and expectation in the room. Following my lead, several other scouts jumped in to take ownership of their actions, apologizing for separating. From that discussion, we discussed how to move forward, and I earned immense trust from every scout. The reflection could have easily descended into a yelling match, but through strong leadership, we all emerged stronger from it.</p><a href=#how-have-you-made-arcadia-high-school-a-better-place><h2 id=how-have-you-made-arcadia-high-school-a-better-place><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>How Have You Made Arcadia High School a Better Place?</h2></a><p>I have bettered AHS through having given more than just what I have received. As Dr. Seuss once stated, ‚ÄúTo the world you may be one person; but to one person you may be the world.‚Äù I know that to me, my friends may be one of a hundred interactions every day, but to them, I may be the only one‚Äîso every single one needs to count. I have been here for my friends when they succeeded, but more importantly also when they failed. I was especially tested when one of my friends began having limiting and sometimes suicidal thoughts. Finding the right words to say was challenging, but I realized that just being open and present was one of the most important things a friend could ask for. The experience was an incredible learning opportunity, for both her and me.</p><p>The world has room for both creators and consumers, but while it is easy to consume and grow, few can truly create value for others. I have created value through my relationships and I hope to keep doing so‚Äîfor Arcadia High School, and beyond.</p><p><a href=/quartz/obsidian/Content/Applications/Rotary-Scholarship rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/obsidian/Content/Applications/Rotary-Scholarship>Rotary Scholarship</a>
