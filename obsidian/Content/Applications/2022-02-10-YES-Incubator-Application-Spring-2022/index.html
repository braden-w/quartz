It started out with Legos, but programming is an entirely different beast‚Äîit allows one to create a living tangible product, one that breathes and responds to every change, until you get it just right. These moments, of immense clarity and euphoria, are what I live for.</p><p>I love a rapid pace. I enjoy the feeling of having coding docs open, along with 20 other tabs, scrambling to find a solution for a new feature. I am drawn to decentralized command, where each individual is empowered to make decisions for the betterment of the team. I enjoy being trusted, depended on, to deliver new features.</p><p>Having been involved with Jonathan Pierre‚Äôs cohort last year in Spring 2021, I would like to once again find an environment which enables me to build things, iterates rapidly, grants autonomy, and provides me the environment to take risks.</p><a href=#tell-us-about-1-thing-that-youve-built-or-achieved-and-the-impact-it-had-this-can-be-a-blog-post-side-project-prose-code-a-community-etc-include-links-pdfs-etc-if-it-helps-supplement-your-answer-><h3 id=tell-us-about-1-thing-that-youve-built-or-achieved-and-the-impact-it-had-this-can-be-a-blog-post-side-project-prose-code-a-community-etc-include-links-pdfs-etc-if-it-helps-supplement-your-answer-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Tell Us About 1 Thing That you‚Äôve Built or Achieved and the Impact it Had.

How many people would like to know what a genuine night as a Yale Student is like (thoughts, experiences, good and bad)? Even though one day is very little for the average Yale student, it is a lot for a person to experience even once.</li><li>Hypothesis: People are willing to offer time (and possibly money) to consume honest content of day in the lives of various experiences, or be arranged to directly experience them.</li><li>Target Customers:<ol><li>Starting with students in college who would like to shop others‚Äô classes (we will take advantage of lectures in which you may walk in). For example, STEM majors who would like to know what it is like to take certain humanities majors. This can be done by using the Coursetable API and enabling friends to share their schedules for classes that are lectures, so that their friends can drop in.</li><li>We can then expand to greater audiences.</li></ol></li><li>Business Model: Honestly, the most difficult part that needs time, input, and can completely fail. I imagine that it is better to release a free web app to test how willing people are to share their schedules with friends, or others, and then expand this to other offerings</li><li>Assumptions:<ol><li>Lectures are able to have capacity for students walking into lectures (as are professors)</li><li>People are willing to pay time or money to experience something for a day</li><li>People are willing to settle for a virtual experience over no experience</li><li>People actively search for new experiences</li></ol></li></ol><a href=#please-tell-us-about-a-time-you-successfully-hacked-some-non-computer-system-to-your-advantage><h3 id=please-tell-us-about-a-time-you-successfully-hacked-some-non-computer-system-to-your-advantage><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Please Tell Us About a Time You Successfully Hacked Some (non-computer) System to Your Advantage.</h3></a><p>As the clipboard landed on my lap, my jaw dropped. Every position overflowed with names, except class president, where there was one‚Äîthe most popular candidate, the incumbent, whom nobody dared oppose. I closed my eyes, and took a deep breath.</p><p>3‚Ä¶2‚Ä¶1‚Ä¶</p><p>The decision to run for class president was the most defining decision and my biggest ‚Äúhack‚Äù I made in high school. Today, I am still amazed by how this one leap of faith completely changed the trajectory of my life‚Äîhow it led to two enthralling weeks of campaigning, a surprise victory, and four years of unforgettable memories and experiences. I am also amazed because it was something I never imagined that I would do. As I sat in that candidate meeting, I probably had one of the lowest election win-rates. I had lost four out of my five previous middle-school campaigns, winning the last only because it took the top two and I finished second. On the first day of school, I stayed behind for the student council meeting not because I thought I could win‚Äîfar from it‚Äîbut because I didn&rsquo;t know who to eat with during lunch. All of my close friends from middle school had moved away.</p><p>It was through jumping into the deep end that I forced myself to innovate, to be resourceful, and take risks. During my campaign, I had to learn how to socialize without having been particularly social. During ASB, I had to learn how to become a leader without having been a leader‚Äîat least, not at that scale. It was challenging. I was definitely really awkward in the beginning when approaching new groups, but gradually learned that I love creating and sharing moments with others. I definitely had many leadership weaknesses at first, but I adopted a growth mindset and listened to my advisors until I was competent enough to advise others. I&rsquo;ve learned that one decision leads to thousands, and decision-making is at the heart of all leadership‚Äîand that we are all leaders, because our choices, starting with the decision to get up and be present every morning, impact countless others every day.</p><p>Today, I embrace taking risks and pushing my boundaries, because it is the ‚Äúhack‚Äù that forces me to adapt and enables creativity and resourcefulness. I hope to continue taking risks in the future.</p><a href=#what-is-a-talent-of-yours><h3 id=what-is-a-talent-of-yours><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What is a Talent of Yours?</h3></a><p>I am interested in understanding the problem, not just finding a solution, and frequently challenge my assumptions to change my beliefs.</p><p>To help achieve this, I often prioritize speed, and can get most of my ideas to a web app MVP within a week. I do my best to avoid overengineering a solution (there is no use making an app scalable if nobody will use it).</p><p>I define my life not by the quantity of my successes, but the quality of my problems.</p><a href=#how-do-you-learn-do-you-consume-any-news--media-what-is-something-you-want-to-learn-more-about><h3 id=how-do-you-learn-do-you-consume-any-news--media-what-is-something-you-want-to-learn-more-about><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>How Do You Learn?
