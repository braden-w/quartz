These experiences laid a foundational knowledge in business that I hope to build upon in coming years, as well as an awareness of issues that I would like to help tackle.

While networking is appreciated, it is not my biggest reason for applying; instead, it is the structured education, opportunity to grow, and understanding of finance that I hope to use in my endeavors to affect change. Through YUDI, I hope to further my understanding of the business world, and identify opportunities to blend my experiences in YEA with YUDI to increase my social impact. Most of all, I enjoy enabling others and the journey for growth, and am excited to learn along the way!</p><a href=#if-any-what-relevant-books-have-you-read-what-news-sources-do-you-follow-to-stay-up-to-date><h2 id=if-any-what-relevant-books-have-you-read-what-news-sources-do-you-follow-to-stay-up-to-date><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>If Any, What Relevant Books Have You Read?

Negotiation is an essential skill that guides almost every interaction in our lives‚Äìwhenever we are not in agreement (and sometimes, even when we are), we are negotiating. Thus, the potential compounding effects of good negotiation are almost limitless, and Never Split the Difference in particular is the most eloquent book I&rsquo;ve read on the topic.</p><p>Currently, I subscribed to daily digest emails from the New York Times, Time Magazine, the Economist, The Wall Street Journal, and news aggregators such as Apple News.

Additionally, I am interested in Yale Computer Society, Yale Machine Learning Society, GRCand Yale Entrepreneurial Society, although the final list will likely be far shorter.</p><p>I believe I will reliably be able to invest about 5 hours per week, with the recognition that time is generally not the primary issue but priorities.

Provide a Brief Description and Analysis (200 Words max)</h2></a><p>IPO: Beyond Meat, 2019</p><p>Beyond Meat, who closed their IPO‚Äôs first day with a valuation northward of 3.8 billion, is most well-known as a maker of vegan beef and sausage substitutes. The IPO is particularly interesting because of its challenge of industry norms: a revenue multiple rivaling those of modern tech companies, in an industry where that is all but the case.</p><p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/c2wPw3FW1a5FXC-HXiXsgRDB-VMpM8AXMLYtnkj1vX-GY_KTEki13HhmUBEQjlKY9KqXIJyzq9dNUwxWO66Pc6YQc5eDGaoO_lzjxRZnbTyreW-BsDvbLq2_nmUBom9XdfelQqKA=s0" width=auto alt></p><p>Source: CNBC as of May 2, 2019.</p><p>When looking at prices, it may be easy to forget that Beyond Meat is a food company, with a gross margin of only 20%. Interestingly, it sits at extremes: incredibly high price-sales ratios compared to food companies, while incredibly low gross margins compared to tech¬† or other fast-growing companies.</p><p>Beyond Meat uses a dual revenue stream model, selling both to retail and restaurant chains. However, while revenue in both areas have grown precipitously, the total slice is nowhere near its valuation.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/h-GZqQCrsGeCSwmRRXrGFC1E9YJ6p6ZXw5ZipkPgQgiIUNiy2XYOu6dVT6Fvpb2VYDvIDEJ-1NeKpJGvbmTJjhYrkOE-xJPlIdg8RMQoFYAk-ibKCXlL7FF7u_kgjXxrIl0GJq9h=s0" width=auto alt></p><p>Data source: SEC filings. Chart by Brian Stoffel. TTM = Trailing 12 months as of December 11, 2019.</p><p>While prices have adjusted since the first day, the record-breaking growth remains, and the company shows promise with its growth trajectory. I am particularly excited by this IPO, as it may signal a growing shift of demand toward more socially and environmentally conscious businesses in the future.</p><p>Sources:</p><p><a href=https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/11/if-you-invested-in-beyond-meats-ipo-how-much-now.aspx rel=noopener>https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/11/if-you-invested-in-beyond-meats-ipo-how-much-now.aspx</a></p><p><a href=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/beyond-meat-soars-163-in-biggest-popping-us-ipo-since-2000-2019-05-02 rel=noopener>https://www.marketwatch.com/story/beyond-meat-soars-163-in-biggest-popping-us-ipo-since-2000-2019-05-02</a></p><p><a href=https://fortune.com/2019/05/02/beyond-meat-ipo-stock-price/ rel=noopener>https://fortune.com/2019/05/02/beyond-meat-ipo-stock-price/</a></p><p><a href=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/02/beyond-meat-is-being-valued-like-a-tech-company-but-it-makes-food.html rel=noopener>https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/02/beyond-meat-is-being-valued-like-a-tech-company-but-it-makes-food.html</a></p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Braden Wong using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, ¬© 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://braden-w.github.io/quartz/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/braden-w>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
