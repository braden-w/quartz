I had a situation that came up and you seemed like the right person to talk to and give an unbiased opinion. I appreciate any time you can offer to help us navigate this situation</p><a href=#tldr><h3 id=tldr><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>TL;DR</h3></a><p>Matt implied that he thought I was an ineffective community builder and should strongly consider giving up community building for future semesters. Furthermore, he revealed that he talked to an Open Phil manager about how he believed Miriam and I severely underperformed this semester. He told me that I will likely not receive funding from the Open Phil fellowship in future semesters as a result, and should consider dropping out as early as today</p><p>I don&rsquo;t fault Matt for holding the views, nor do I hold anything personally against him. I am also grateful that he told me, as the alternative would be just an invisible reputation/blacklist without me knowing what happened. I was just taken aback that the talking was done without anticipation and that there is no opportunity to advocate for myself. The thought that EA may lose trust in me as a community builder or ‚Äúgive up‚Äù on me has perturbed me in the past few days, especially if there is nothing I can do to reverse it. I also felt like Matt had overlooked some my work in past semesters (such as the fellowship) and other softer qualities outside of pure logistics. I would like a chance to prove myself next semester, but I am concerned that Matt (and funders) would not like that to happen</p><p>Disclaimer: I acknowledge that this is from my point of view. I have waited a few days to reflect and hope to represent Matt and the events as objectively and fairly as possible. Nothing beats representing Matt&rsquo;s point of view by listening him to directly, so I intend to talk to him again (and if you like, you could be part of that discussion).</p><a href=#more-details><h3 id=more-details><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>More Details</h3></a><p>Matt and I called earlier this semester, this first call being constructive exploration of our different leadership approaches. This was a wholesome call. It seemed like we really actually agreed on so many aspects of leading, even if we had come at odds earlier last semester (which was why we had a call in the first place). I don&rsquo;t wish to incorrectly speak on behalf of Matt, but it seems like we both emerged from this call with a greater understanding of each other</p><p>This second call was more directed at me than the last one, and it seems like there were still a few unaddressed issues. Matt called to express his main criticism was that I don&rsquo;t get things done. He cited the first half of last semester as the primary area of improvement. I agree with almost all of his criticisms in this section. I could have definitely have done more in the first half of last semester. I also know that during last semester, I had misprioritized between managing the board, lock down speaker events, etc.. I was hoping to create a lasting shift by recruiting members to SP who seemed promising for future CB. However, I understand that Matt couldn&rsquo;t have seen that, just the results or lack thereof. I also fault myself for not prioritizing the lock down speaker events responsibility more. Were all those 1-1&rsquo;s worth it? I had really dropped the ball in this aspect, and it is plausible that most of my 1-1&rsquo;s were a waste of time, at least in the short term.</p><p>In the second half of the call, he expressed that he felt I was a poor fit for Special Projects Team. He explained that he had a 1-1 with Sarah and found her to be very exciting‚Äîa bit ironic because that is exactly how I felt about Sarah and the reason why I was persistent to have her (she was initially very hesitant to commit this summer and I tried to be as supportive and flexible as possible). Matt expressed his believe that other SP members like Will or Sarah could do a better job than me. I also find this 100% plausible especially for certain tasks‚Äîfor speaker events, I think Sarah is unequivocally a better option than me, which is why I approached her and was so persistent on working with her. However, I felt like he did a lot of overlooking on the amount of time I had spent with each member to get them invested and working on projects, or the broader role of delegating responsibility</p><p>But at the very end of the call, he stated he talked about this to the manager and I was kinda taken aback, because he had never hinted that he was doing this. Hopefully I expressed this with you in our 1-1 last semester, I am excited to continue our work next semester and prove myself in contrast to last semester. I thought Matt&rsquo;s feedback was for this, to improve the upcoming semester. However, instead, there was an uneasy permanence to this section.</p><p>He heavily implied that I should stop being a community builder as early as now (he offered to take over the Summer Incubator immediately), and re: how can I best respond or improve my standing, he talked about generally, fund managers or the one he talked are pretty set on either you are an effective or ineffective community builder (basically, there was little I could do about this situation, as the manager already made up her mind).</p><p>I totally see Matt&rsquo;s point of view and I don&rsquo;t fault him for calling me to express criticism‚ÄîI welcome it. At worse, it is hard not to feel coerced and have my options limited, especially because he had a conversation behind my back. I also feel misunderstood, because I know that I did spend time last semester finding people. Nothing really hit me in the moment, but in retrospect it, definitely become a challenging situation and hurts if I lose the trust of Open Phil or other organizations without opportunity to defend myself. I will be talking with him again later this week to sort out these issues.</p><p>Were you aware of this and/or should I give up community building? I was wondering what you would recommend as a next step, and if I am overreacting. Given the gravity of the situation, I really could use an unbiased opinion. I will be talking with Matt again later as well. If it easier to talk about this over a call, I would be happy to this week at your convenience.</p><a href=#snippets-from-talk-with-miriam><h2 id=snippets-from-talk-with-miriam><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Snippets From Talk with Miriam</h2></a><p>Matt talked to an Open Phil manager and our names came up as individuals he felt fell short of expectation. We might not receive funding from the open Phil fellowship next semester as a result</p><p>But definitely I was surprised to hear this yesterday from him yesterday
Regardless, I think Matt heavily implied he doesn&rsquo;t want me to cb next sem
Just to be clear, I have nothing against matt and I can totally see how he sees it from his perspective
I just am concerned that i might not get that chance this semester depending on how deep Matt has talked about it with the manager
I definitely feel like last semester I could have done so much better in the first hf and want a chance to prove myself next semester</p><p>Yeah he just asked for a 1-1 with me twice this summer
First was constructive and nice
Second was more about talking how
I don&rsquo;t really get things done as I should (I agree for the first half of second semester), he thinks Will or Sarah could do a better job than me at special projects, he would like me to do a different task
But at the very end of the call he stated he talked about this to the manager and I was kinda taken aback because I thought I would have the opportunity to improve next sem but the way it was framed, i should take a step back next semester
Also re how can I respond or improve my standing he talked about generly, fund managers or this one tend to be pretty set on either you are an effective or ineffextice cb
Anyways I don&rsquo;t want to read too deep into it, I&rsquo;m also in a better headspace now and don&rsquo;t fault Matt for holding the views, they are understandable
Just a little taken aback that the talking was done without anticipation or my knowledge before
Idk I just
Would like a chance to prove myself next semester
Not get blacklisted :')</p><a href=#thomass-response><h2 id=thomass-response><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Thomas&rsquo;s Response</h2></a><p>Hi Braden,</p><p>I understand this is something that may have caught you off guard. I think the essential problem is somewhat what you outlined above but not exactly. I don&rsquo;t really think the problem is that you don&rsquo;t get things done. I think you sometimes do get things done, sometimes not, and sometimes it has created problems when you don&rsquo;t (though I will note, not nearly the same degree of problems as Miriam&rsquo;s inability to get things done).</p><p>In my view the main thing, which I have been asking you for more than a year now, is¬†<em>what is your goal?</em>¬†What do you actually want to achieve? Why are you a community builder for YEA? What should YEA be trying to do? Why are we running particular events? I ask these questions frequently, mainly because I don&rsquo;t really hear an answer from you.</p><p>We got you involved in serious organizing when you had only just started at Yale. My impression was that you hadn&rsquo;t really had time to think about what you really wanted from YEA or from your life, which is completely understandable and how it should be. But I haven&rsquo;t really seen a great indication that you truly feel the importance of this, in the way that I think (e.g.) Simon or Alexa does. I think it may have been a mistake to take you on with so much responsibility then, not because you couldn&rsquo;t handle it, but because you didn&rsquo;t have time to really know if this was something that was important to you.</p><p>In the average student group, you may just try to grow the group. Or perhaps somebody just tells you what to do and you execute (Sarah Shapiro is a very good executor, for instance). EA is different because nobody knows what the heck to do, if growing the group is even good, what kinds of things will even matter. EA is different because people shouldn&rsquo;t care about the student group in itself, they shouldn&rsquo;t care about what it can do for them, they should care about what it can do for the world. And I didn&rsquo;t feel that essential connection between yourself and what we were trying to achieve. I mainly felt you were optimizing for subgoals without really knowing why. This actually is fine in a large organization, since somebody can just give you your subgoals and you can do them, but it is not fine in a very small organization where every individual needs to really believe that what they are doing is actually achieving something.</p><p>My sense is that your main approach has been to build various structures that will help get things done. But what exactly to get done seems a bit haphazard and I do not really understand the theory of impact for some of it. We&rsquo;ve discussed various things at length, but my sense is that we are coming from fundamentally different places when thinking about things.</p><p>For example, it seems you are in favor of taking significantly more risks with respect to community building strategies, more in line with Simon. But when I talk to Simon, I understand him as somebody who wants the same thing as I do but has a different approach for achieving it. I frequently think he wants to take too many risks, and I&rsquo;ll argue with him about it, but in the end I know we are on the same page. With you, I simply don&rsquo;t feel this way; rather I feel that you are choosing actions for the particular action that it is or the particular person endorsing it, rather than the aims it will intend to bring about.</p><p>Not everyone needs to believe in EA. In fact, I think EA could even do good things for some people who don&rsquo;t really, if it helps them get into high impact careers. But in terms of community building leadership, we need somebody who really buys the central premises, and I haven&rsquo;t seen strong indications that you do.</p><p>In comparison to somebody like Sarah, I think you are less organized and more likely to drop tasks. But I don&rsquo;t think this means you&rsquo;re especially bad. I think Alexa is less organized and more likely to drop tasks than Sarah. The problem is that if we want somebody to lead, we want somebody who really believes in the mission and is good at thinking about how to achieve it, and if we want somebody to execute, we want somebody who is absurdly organized and unlikely to drop tasks. I think Matt was essentially saying that if you are in the executor role, there are better executors, and I think I&rsquo;d roughly agree with him.</p><p>I discussed this with Matt and Alexa earlier on and said similar things to the above. In fact, the meeting we scheduled was so we could be on the same page with regard to how we were going to approach this with you. I scheduled it specifically because I knew the funders will ask us about everyone and if they should be funded, and we needed to be on the same page about what to say. Matt didn&rsquo;t mention to me that he was going to be meeting with Asya prior to our meeting, if he had I would have told him we needed to schedule it earlier. I was quite disappointed with the way that he blindsided you by not discussing with you in frank terms what he would say beforehand, even though we had agreed that he would do that. I am not sure if he said this to you, but he apologized for doing this and said he would not do it again. It is not an appropriate thing for him to have done.</p><p>However, in this particular instance I do not think that the outcome would have changed. You would have had a chance to discuss it before Matt discussed with any funders, but I do not think you would have changed his mind, so he would have said the same thing. At this point I&rsquo;m not sure what I would have said if it had been me who&rsquo;d been asked, but probably something similar to what I just wrote.</p><p>Now to the question of whether I personally think you should continue doing community building. As I said, I think there are some problems with your execution style, but that&rsquo;s not the essential point. Think about why you would actually want to continue doing community building. What is the purpose? What calls you to do it? If you&rsquo;re doing it because you think that your specific community building is a way in which you might be able to do the most good, and you really feel that deeply as something you want to do, then yes, I think you should continue doing community building. I think in that case, you will not let me and Matt and some Open Phil employee stop you from doing community building which you once did for free, and you will keep doing community building not despite but because of our incompetence in properly seeing that you really care. If Matt and Asya Bergal told me that they thought I didn&rsquo;t really care about the essential mission of community building, I would go and do my own thing, because they would be wrong and I would be right.</p><p>But if that&rsquo;s not why, and YEA is just a thing that you do, and you like the people and you like taking on projects and responsibilities and maybe you like having a bit of extra money, then no, I don&rsquo;t think you should keep doing it.</p><p>This could be totally off. Maybe the difference really is execution, and you feel the same way as I do about things but just think so differently about achieving them that I can&rsquo;t recognize that. In that case, most of what I wrote would be incorrect and I would have a pretty different approach (namely, trying to move you to whatever project, if any, you can execute best on, or perhaps advising you to gain other kinds of skills rather than community building). But that hasn&rsquo;t been my impression.</p><p>Thomas</p><a href=#response-to-thomas><h2 id=response-to-thomas><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Response to Thomas</h2></a><p>Thank you so much for the response Thomas. I appreciate you putting so much time in writing this, and I am grateful to have such a level-headed and thoughtful response. It could not have had come at a better time, as I had a call with Teddy just 5 minutes after you sent the message. It was one of the most reflective discussions I have had.</p><p>The past day was admittedly dark but offered unprecedented distance and clarity. When Matt called me, I felt like my entire world was being shut out from EA. We had no time for follow up questions. For a day, I felt that EA was not a part of my life. As you mentioned before, I got into community building really early in college, and I got into it without really figuring out what I wanted to do. I think that this is a common issue for people who get into it early. I have never really seen what my life is like without EA, but for a day, I felt what that was like.</p><p>EA has shaped me in so many ways, but I still feel that I stick out like a sore thumb. It bothers me that I have not taken a gap year or moved into the YEA house. Perhaps I am not as willing to make sacrifices for EA in the way others do. But I do know that my eyes light up whenever I talk about EA, maybe more than most. My close EA adjacent friends have told me that I am a very good, if not the best, spokesperson of EA concepts they have met. Many of my friends who haven‚Äôt heard of EA before consider me the face of YEA. I don‚Äôt know what to make of this‚Äîperhaps this is a bad thing for YEA to be associated with me‚Äîbut I do know this reinforces a cognitive dissonance. I feel like I tell, but I do not show . I may buy the central premises, go out of my way to chat with students, but I don‚Äôt show it in my actions in the same way other community builders do. Why is it that I may seem so enthusiastic, but when it comes time to actually prioritizing certain things over other things, I can‚Äôt make the same decision?</p><p>I think that there is a level of community building is assuaging this feeling.</p><p>I am happy to work with YEA‚Äîeven if you, Alexa, and Matt believe I am an ineffective CB. And this being the case, I still want to be actively participating in YEA in other ways outside of exec team. If EA cut only funding the next day, I would still invest just as much time as I intended. If EA also cut trust in me, I would be sadder, and feel what I felt yesterday. But I know that there is a way to make substantive change outside of EA. EA principles have already indelibly influenced my life trajectory‚ÄîI just don‚Äôt know how much yet.</p><p>As for next steps, at your convenience, I would also like to ask if we could finish discussing this via call, with Alexa and Matt if possible, so I could express a few more thoughts as they come. During our call, I would like to explore the following:</p><ol><li>I would like to transition outside of exec team, on amicable terms, and still contribute to YEA. For all my college career, I have only known investing more and more time into EA. Let‚Äôs talk about how to transition and transfer ownership of special projects, etc. as smoothly as possible</li><li>Explore options for next semester<ol><li>Founding the Developmental Economics Club at Yale<ol><li>My friend, Bilal Moin, is my most EA adjacent friend (goes to career advising, Phillip Trammel invited him to an economics retreat, etc.) and started a development economics club. I think this is an area where my skills are appreciated. They need a website and want to start a fellowship, and my training in YEA would be incredibly useful for them. Additionally, the founding team is more mixed and less ‚ÄúEA‚Äù in the sense that they are less autonomous, need more coralling, etc.‚Äîwhich I am used to.</li></ol></li><li>Having 1-1&rsquo;s, I‚Äôm down to have a lot of them. My experiences have led me to believe I have a comparative advantage to introducing EA to people, especially newer students. Also, it is what brings me the most joy of the three options</li><li>Facilitating</li></ol></li></ol><p>Thank you once again for handling this situation with so much maturity and care. I hope that I have handled this situation with even a fraction of that level.
The reason I community build is twofold. When I was younger, I was excited to be a part of something bigger. In my second year, it was because I remember the intense feeling of loneliness of my first year, and felt thatt . EA felt like it was so close to being exactly what I wanted to be, and i</p><p>Perhaps it is something where I have known EA my entire college career that I have been blind to what my life is without it.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this with Teddy, Miriam. It feels like the three of us represent a different side of EA (although from my impression, Miriam does a lot of logstical work for EA).</p><a href=#call-with-teddy><h2 id=call-with-teddy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Call with Teddy</h2></a><ul><li>We don&rsquo;t want our lives to be EA.

I want them to win.</p><p>There are people who light up when they hear EA concepts for the first time, and want to immediately take action. Over time, they realize and buy into EA principles. This is a differentiating point.¬†I believe that the world would be a better place if we could maximize that number of people.</p><p>I do not consider myself as someone who fully buys into EA concepts. I cannot say for certain I will pursue a career in direct work, or to what extent I will put EA concepts into practice in my actual life. At least, that is my impression right now.</p><p>But I love talking about them. I will always present them generously and in good faith, and engage with people who feel strongly about it, positively or negatively.

It is what makes me difficult to read, even for myself, because my motivations are complex and perhaps partly motivated by guilt.</p><p>I do not necessarily buy EA principles, but I want them to win. I want them to spread as fast as possible, and for us to maximize the number of people actively working on these issues. This may be completely wrong, but it is what I currently optimize for when I am in EA mode. Of all the motivations I have ever discussed, and across all the various roles I have found myself in two years with YEA with varying degrees of fit, this has been the one that has stayed consistent¬†</p><a href=#call-with-thomas><h2 id=call-with-thomas><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Call with Thomas</h2></a><ul><li>Thomas‚ÄîI can take money from people who don&rsquo;t agree with me<ul><li>Meeting with people who disagreed but still respected me the same to fund me<ul><li>Understood we wanted the same thing, so respected</li></ul></li><li>Huge update for me‚ÄîI do not need to buy EA principles at all to community build</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>I can be a leader, but I don&rsquo;t have to represent the movement or even agree with anything it says.
