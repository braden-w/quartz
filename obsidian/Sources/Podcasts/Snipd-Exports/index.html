That's not something that i've thought of before, and it's simply because i've overlooked it. But it makes sense. Because my sister, who's reasonably fit, i'm always trying to get her to do a bit more. She always asks me, what should i take? And i believe her in supplements for certain people in certain instances. But i keep telling her, you know, the behaviours are going to ande. Nutrition are ging to have the greatest outsize, possitive effect. And she loves things like um dance classe and things, or kick boxing, these counds of things, which so it make sense that if you can hook somebody on the conditioning aspect or the skill aspect, and can't trick them into doing more cardio, so to speak, that that's terrific. Also, the neuro scientist in me just has to say, forgive me a that any time you're engaging the ouow tha two sets of motor narons, the ones in your brain, the upper motor rons, and the ones in your spinal cord. Any time you're engaging those upper motor nerons, which are for deliberate, well controlled action, you're doing a great thing for your brain in terms of brain longevity. So i now i need to incorporate some actual skills in my training. Am going back to t training a bit. One of the most important things i learned from you over the years was that when training to increase muscle size, to really think not so much about moving weights, but more about challenging muscles. I also heard this from my friend ben ski, who was very well accomplished. He was a body builder. Now he's in other aspects of fitness. Teach his fitness, but don't move weights. Challenge muscles, unless you're trying o power lift or something of that sort, which i'm not immensely helpful. But the other thing that i learned from you, that i combined with that, was this idea that certain muscles will grow better and get stronger much more easily, maybe even will recover better, because of our ability to contract them really hard.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#2952-the-cavalier-test><h3 id=2952-the-cavalier-test><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[29:52] The Cavalier Test</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/60bb8a30-abdd-499c-96a8-1dfd913ebdba rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (28:24 - 29:52)</a>

If you can, if you can flex your bicep to the point where it hurts a little bit, like, it almost feels like a cramp, or a cramp, or you can flex your calf to the point where it really cramps up a loab, it almost fels like its nodding up, that's a pretty good indication that you're going to be able to stimulate that muscle well, under load, if you're doing the movement properly.

What's been shown is that when, when the repair process, muscular repair, from, lets say, strength riting during the day, the repair process usually results in a muscle that is slightly shorter, rather than increased in length. You know, its isthat. It's, your muscles prefer to sort of yo ratchet their way down into that that contraction, and then you maintain that that that more comfortable length tension relationship. So when you're sleeping, it tends to you on the side of shorter rather than longer. When an ideall, we don't really want that. We want to maintain as much of that length, because with more length, we actually have more leverage, right? That muscle has more leverage to contract if it was all the way contracted. Yeu really can't ois weu know, generate much force in a muscle that's already maximumly contracted.

You'll feel it in your jaw. You'll ritly feel your jaw rattle when you land on your heels. There is no shock absorption capabilities through your heels.

Well, there is, maybe there is some adaptability because it's so floppy. But at the same time, at some point, that critical juncture when you're going to then step through and you need to be able to push off, the foot has to actually change in the mid foot itself to become a rigid lever, as they call it. You're going from a mobile adaptor to a rigid lever. That rigid lever literally locks up the mid tarsal joint to come solid so that you can push off it with leverage.

Whenever i can, i try and go into external rotation, provided without looking like an idiot, walked round with my palms facing outward. Please tell us about internal external rotation.

All of a sudden that train track on the bottom gets torked just a little bit? Well, who's going to feel that the most? The area where it's torking, which is at the knee. So the stress are going to be felt there. Meanwhile, the problem is the foot, or the problem is the ankle. People that are chronic ankle sprainers are almost always going to wind up having back pain, because the ankle sprain causes weakness and maladaptations in the ankle that then gets connected through the chain. Because now, once i distort the ankle on the shin, now the knee is trying to maintain its ability to hinge smoothly, so it torks on the femur to do that, while the femer's now inside the hip joint pulling on the pelvis, and the pelvis is ot of whack. So it's realief. It's really as fascinating. Like, it's one of my favorite things about how the body works, is like how it interconnected it is, and how one little thing somewhere causes repercussion somewhere else. And the easiest way to find out what your problem is is to say, i know where my symtem is, but i got to find someone who can help me find the source somewhere else. Because it is going to be usually either above or below, mostly usually below, because it usually translat up the connectict chain. But usually it's going to be below where the real source is.

Are used to, at least with baseball too, there is a cheesecake factory everywhere you went. And i love cheesecake factory. But like, the way they structure meals is it's all rice on the bottom and ha little bit chicken on top. I mean, it's a plateful of rice that you wouldn't find me make a plate that way. I'm going to just devote that portion of the plate to the starchy carbohydrate. And so it gives me a little bit more responsibility in terms of portion control. Cause those are the foods a, again, probably younow, don't mean driven, that are most easily overeaten. I always asked the question, how it was the last time you ate ten chicken breasts at a meal, like you're getting sick of it after maybe two or three. But you could eat a whole hel of a lot of carbohydrate, starching carbohydrates, because t they're just so satisfying. And i think those triggers, as you said, they want more. Like that's what happens, right? You just keep even when you're feeling full, you want more. Ah, and that's the biggest danger to carbohydrate. So if you can develop some sort of discipline around them, a, then you can still enjoy them. If you can't develop that discipline a, for whatever reason, then maybe they do become something that you have to work yourself around or adopt. The differnt eting style.

It‚Äôs designed for people who don‚Äôt have clinical insomnia but would like to fine-tune their sleep. Matt goes over five conventional tips, and five unconventional tips that may be new to you.¬†<br>The first tip is regularity‚Äîgoing to bed and waking up at the same time every day. Your brain has its own master 24-hour clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which expects regularity.¬†<br>Second is temperature‚Äîyour brain and body need to drop their temperature for you to fall and stay asleep, so the ambient temperature must be cold.¬†<br>Third is darkness‚Äîwe need darkness to trigger the release of melatonin.¬†<br>Fourth is to walk it out. If it‚Äôs been around 25 minutes, and you can‚Äôt fall asleep, get out of bed, relax in another room, and come back to bed later.¬†<br>Finally, try to abstain from coffee from around noon and avoid drinking alcohol in the evening.<br>Of the non-conventional tips, the first is this: if you‚Äôve had a bad night‚Äôs sleep,¬† DO NOTHING. Don t wake up any later. Don t drink excessive compensation caffeine. Don t nap. And don t go to bed any earlier the following night. That explains the reasons why.<br>The second tip is to have a wind-down routine. Your biology needs to wind down so you can descend into good sleep at night, so we should all find our own wind-down routine.<br>Third is to stay away from naps, especially after 1pm, which is a bit like snacking before your main meal.¬†<br>The fourth tip is don‚Äôt count sheep. It doesn t work (in fact, it makes matters worse!) Instead, take yourself on a familiar mental walk. Doing this helps take your mind off itself and lets you fall asleep because you stop overthinking.<br>And the ffinal unconventional tip is to remove or cover all clock faces in the bedroom.¬†<br>Please note that Matt is not a medical doctor, and none of the content in this podcast should be considered medical advice in any way, shape, or form, nor prescriptive in any way.<br>The good people at InsideTracker are one of the sponsors of this week s episode, and they are generously offering a special 25% off any one of their programs for anyone who uses the above link during the time window of this episode.

Goodness, i'm very envious if you can do that, if you're lucky enough to live by the beach. But just really pleasant walk that you do. Think about that, as long as it's something that you know well. And then start in really great, high fidelity detail. Think about leaving your front door, going down the steps, and then you're out, and then your stead of moving this direction.

But are people generally bad at predicting far future events, including thoughtful people who are trying reason hard to be right? If we look back at prominent futurist predictions, what's the actual track record? How bad is the situation? I've looked pretty far and wide for systematic answers to this question, and open philanthropys luk muelhauser, has put in a fair amount of effort into researching it. I link to a couple of his reports. So far, we haven't turned up a whole lot. The main observation is that it's hard to judge the track record of futurists.

The track record of futurists seems fine. I've argued that the development of advanced dei could make this the most important century for humanity. A common reaction to this idea is one laid out by tyler cowan in a piece that i link to, where he says, how good we're, past thinkers, at predicting the future. Don't just select on those who are famous because they got some big things right now. This is a common reason people give for being sceptical about the most important century hypothesis, and often for scepticism about pretty much any attempt at futurism, trying to predict key event in the world a long time from now, or what i call steering, trying to help the world navigate key future events.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#300--joe-rogan-comedy-controversy-aliens-ufos-putin-cia-and-freedom><h1 id=300--joe-rogan-comedy-controversy-aliens-ufos-putin-cia-and-freedom><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>#300 ‚Äì Joe Rogan: Comedy, Controversy, Aliens, UFOs, Putin, CIA, and Freedom</h1></a><p><img src="https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flexfridman.com%2Fwordpress%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fpowerpress%2Fartwork_3000-230.png&w=200&h=200" width=200 alt=Cover|200></p><a href=#episode-metadata-4><h2 id=episode-metadata-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Episode Metadata</h2></a><ul><li>Episode title:: <a href=/quartz#300-joe-rogan-comedy-controversy-aliens-ufos-putin-cia-and-freedom rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz></a></li><li>Show:: <a class="internal-link broken">Lex Fridman Podcast</a></li><li>Owner / Host:: <a href=/quartz/obsidian/Sources/Podcasts/Lex-Fridman rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/obsidian/Sources/Podcasts/Lex-Fridman>Lex Fridman</a></li><li>Episode link::

States now have far less leeway to restrict gun permits. The right to abortion is no longer constitutionally protected. The Environmental Protection Agency has been kneecapped in its ability to regulate carbon emissions, and by extension, all executive branch agencies will see their power significantly diminished.<br>But to focus only on this particular Supreme Court term is to miss the bigger picture: In the past few decades, conservative court majorities have dragged this country‚Äôs laws to the right on almost every issue imaginable. Shelby County v. Holder gutted the Voting Rights Act and opened the door for states to pass restrictive voting laws. Rucho v. Common Cause limited the court‚Äôs ability to curb partisan gerrymandering. Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission unleashed a torrent of campaign spending. Janus v. AFSCME Council 31 weakened unions. A whole slew of cases, including some decided on the shadow docket during the Covid-19 pandemic, undercut federal agencies‚Äô power to help govern in an era of congressional gridlock. And that‚Äôs only a partial list.<br>Kate Shaw is a law professor at Cardozo School of Law, a co-host of the legal podcast Strict Scrutiny and a former clerk for Justice John Paul Stevens. In this episode, she walks me through the most significant Supreme Court cases over the past 20 years, from the court‚Äôs decision to hand George W. Bush the presidency in 2000, to the dismantling of the Voting Rights Act, to the assertion of an individual‚Äôs right to bear arms.<br>Along the way, we discuss the right‚Äôs decades-long effort to transform American law from the bench, how Republican-appointed judges have consistently entrenched Republican political power, the interpretive bankruptcy of constitutional originalism, how the Warren Court radicalized the conservative legal movement, what might happen to decisions like Obergefell v. Hodges now that the court majority seems to be so comfortable throwing out precedent, what cases to watch in the Roberts Court‚Äôs next term, and more.<br>Mentioned:<br>‚Äú After Citizens United: How Outside Spending Shapes American Democracy ‚Äù by Nour Abdul-Razzak, Carlo Prato and Stephane Wolton<br>‚Äú The Most Important Study in the Abortion Debate ‚Äù by Annie Lowrey<br>Book recommendations:<br>The Turnaway Study by Diana Greene Foster<br>Torn Apart by Dorothy Roberts<br>Who Decides? by Jeffrey S.

This patirla opinion. And if you listen to thi show, i think you'lve see in overtime that i don't have very much respect for the supreme court. And it's because of opinions like citizens united were i read them an realize they're doing what i do, just worse. They're just running crappy punditry. So you ere talking about kennedy's views there of whether corruption can be addressed. But kennedy goes further. He talks about whether or not corruption is present. He he makes as cor his inion, like an actual view, about whether or not political contributions of this kind will either create real corruption or the appearance of it. Because he agrees on some level that there is an interest in reducing corruption and the appearance of it. So he he writes, we now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. He goes on to say, the fact that speakers, by which he means here donors, may have influence over or access to elected officials, does not mean that these officials are corrupt. Then he goes on to say, the appear rence of influence or access furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy. And i don't understand how you can see that is anything but punditry. I mean, bad punditry. I would be embarrassed to make that argument. But nevertheless, it is a crucial decision that is not, in any way that i can tell, truly illegal decision. Much like john roberts decides racism isn't that bad any more, justice kennedy decides political corruption isn't that bad any more. And what is so weird about it to me is, if you would imagine that there would be anywhere in the world, in the law that you would obviously defer to elected politicians on what is going on here, it would be on the question of whether or not unlimited independent campaign contributions lead to corruption, or the appearance of corruption in political practice. And kennidy decides he knows better than te no elof sight.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#299--demis-hassabis-deepmind><h1 id=299--demis-hassabis-deepmind><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>#299 ‚Äì Demis Hassabis: DeepMind</h1></a><p><img src="https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flexfridman.com%2Fwordpress%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fpowerpress%2Fartwork_3000-230.png&w=200&h=200" width=200 alt=Cover|200></p><a href=#episode-metadata-6><h2 id=episode-metadata-6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Episode Metadata</h2></a><ul><li>Episode title:: <a href=/quartz#299-demis-hassabis-deepmind rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz></a></li><li>Show:: <a class="internal-link broken">Lex Fridman Podcast</a></li><li>Owner / Host:: <a href=/quartz/obsidian/Sources/Podcasts/Lex-Fridman rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/obsidian/Sources/Podcasts/Lex-Fridman>Lex Fridman</a></li><li>Episode link::

What are all these things? Rightwi, wi, we've wondered about them since since the dawn of humanity. And i think one of the reasons, and you know, i love philosophy, and philosophy of mind, is we've found, i difficulties. There haven't been the tools for us to really, other than introspection, two fromvery clever people in history, very clever philosophers, to really investigate this scientifically. But now, suddenly we have a pelethro of tools. First, we have all the newer science tools, from u machine, single cell recording, all this stuff.

And if you get a bit more nirty about it, which i love to do as a physicist, then it's quite obvious that if we really succeed in figuring out what intelligence is, and how to build things that are as intelligent as aws of physics allow, you know, that we would shift from suddenly being limited, not by what we can figure out, to just being limited by the laws of physics. And you can get nerty on that and realize that it's just so many orders of magnitude more in all ways. If you ask how much compute per second get, or if you ask how how possible it is to go travel to other galaxies, or basic any actes you're excited about, we're nowhere near the limits that the laws of physics place the speed of light, that you can't be stuff like that. And the secret to unlocking this is through artificial intelligence. Now, so that's the upside. Basically, anything you would like to do which we haven't been smart enough to do yet, cure cancer, eliminate poverty, help people live exciting, inspiring lives, or for that matter, if you would like to help help life spread throughout our observe, much of our servable universe. Any of those things, artificial intelligence has a potential to give them to you. And moreover. You don't have to wait millions of years, like in the syphi novels. It's quite likely that, i believe, we could get this in our lifetime. So that's the upside. But we also know that every tool we have is a double edged sword, not just a sword.

Rob people are really all over the place, even very educated people. And there are these two basic dimensions you outline first the question of, well, how soon and will this happen, and how far will it go? Where you'll have some people like my former m i t colleague, professor rodney brooks, who says it's not going to happen for 300 years, ther we'll even to human level, and a hundred % sure. And then you have other people, which aren't actually most people in the technical community now, who think tits can happen a lot sooner. And recent poles of ai researchers tend to predict that ao decades from now, we'll have a that can do basically all our human jobs, or cheaper than we can. That that's one axis where you can basicaly classify people from techno sceptics to think it's never going to work, to techno optimists. And then on the other axis, it's do they think this is going to suck, or going to be great? Where maybe it actually says more about peoples personality traits and whether than than anything scientific, really where they land on that. Some people tend to becone of hopeful and optimistic about everything. Some people are more prone to wishful thinking than others. If we take the first one, the question of what will actually happen, i think a very common misconception, specially among scientists, is that intelligence is something mysterious that can only exist inside of biological organisms like human beings and te if we've learned anything from physics, it's that the no, intelligence is about information processing. And it really doesn't ter whether the information is processed by a carbon atom, by carbon atoms in neurons in brains, in people, or by silican atoms in some g pu somewhere. It's the information processing itself that matters. It's this sub straight independent nature information processing t hat doesn't matter whether it's a mack or a pc you're running it on, or linnox box, or for that matter, what the cpu manufacture is, or even whether it's biological or silican base that matters. It's just the information processing that matters. That's really been the number one corps idea. I would say, that that's caused the tion at nai, that you can keep swabping up out your hardware and using the same alegarithms. Whence you once you accept that that you and i are blobs of corks and electrons that happen to be arranged in a way such that they can process information, well, it's pretty obvious that, unless you have weigh more hubrous than i do, you know that the we are not the most optimized cork blobs possible for information processing.

It's identical in canada and the u. K. Australian new zealand are very similar there, ust after a little delay. So whatever we're looking for here, but yet, it's not, it's not as clear in the germanic countries. In continental europe, it's little different. And we can get into that when we talk about childhood. But something's happening in many countries a that. And it started right around 20 12, 20 13. It wasn't gradual. A, it hit girls hardest, and it hit preteen girls the hardest. So what could it be? Nobody has come up with another explanation. Nobody. It wasn't the financial crisis, that wouldn't hit preteen girls the hardest. A, there is no other explanation. The complexity here. And the data is, of course, as everyone knows, correlation doesn't prove causation. The fact that television viewing was going up in the fifties and or in the sixties and seventies doesn't mean that that was the cause of the crime. So what i've done a, and this is work with jean twang, who wrote the book, igen is ah. Because i was challenged you know, one nigt. When gregg and i put out the book, the coddling themerican mind, some researchers challenged us and said, oh, you do't nowha.

Anyway, so the scrolling, i think, is bad for the girls.

That depended a great deal on if mike pence had just said, yes, where would we have been? We would have been through the looking glass on a constitutional crisis.

And then after mike pince says no, this is one thing that's incredibly sobering to me, as if you look at the approval ratings of donald trump and mike pince after january sixth, one of ther only one of the two, their approval rating plunges, and its mike pince, not donald trump. Incredible. So what that told me is that you had a republican party tat was so fully committed to this election steel effort, that even a long time republican who had stood by donald trump's side every moment of his presidency, who then appeals to his faith as an evangel lical who is sort of the representative of the evangelical base and the trump administration, appeals to his faith to do the right thing, and he's rejected by his own movement in favor of donald trump. And to me, in some ways, that was as sobering as all the ents that happened before that, not even the shock of the moment of january sixth could shake people from this hyper partisanship and animosity and distrust that led them down the road.

The wisdom of evolution is that the risk of violence is just too great.<br><br>Which might make one wonder: if war is so destructive, why does it happen? The question may sound na√Øve, but in fact it represents a deep puzzle. If a war will cost trillions and kill tens of thousands, it should be easy for either side to make a peace offer that both they and their opponents prefer to actually fighting it out.<br><br>The conundrum of how humans can engage in incredibly costly and protracted conflicts has occupied academics across the social sciences for years. In today's episode, we speak with economist Chris Blattman about his new book, Why We Fight: The Roots of War and the Paths to Peace , which summarises what they think they've learned.<br><br>Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.<br><br>Chris's first point is that while organised violence may feel like it's all around us, it's actually very rare in humans, just as it is with other animals. Across the world, hundreds of groups dislike one another ‚Äî but knowing the cost of war, they prefer to simply loathe one another in peace.<br><br>In order to understand what‚Äôs wrong with a sick patient, a doctor needs to know what a healthy person looks like. And to understand war, social scientists need to study all the wars that could have happened but didn't ‚Äî so they can see what a healthy society looks like and what's missing in the places where war does take hold.<br><br>Chris argues that social scientists have generated five cogent models of when war can be 'rational' for both sides of a conflict:<br><br>1. Unchecked interests ‚Äî such as national leaders who bear few of the costs of launching a war.<br>2. Intangible incentives ‚Äî such as an intrinsic desire for revenge.<br>3. Uncertainty ‚Äî such as both sides underestimating each other's resolve to fight.<br>4. Commitment problems ‚Äî such as the inability to credibly promise not to use your growing military might to attack others in future.<br>5. Misperceptions ‚Äî such as our inability to see the world through other people's eyes.<br><br>In today's interview, we walk through how each of the five explanations work and what specific wars or actions they might explain.<br><br>In the process, Chris outlines how many of the most popular explanations for interstate war are wildly overused (e.g. leaders who are unhinged or male) or misguided from the outset (e.g. resource scarcity).<br><br>The interview also covers:<br><br>‚Ä¢ What Chris and Rob got wrong about the war in Ukraine<br>‚Ä¢ What causes might not fit into these five categories<br>‚Ä¢ The role of people's choice to escalate or deescalate a conflict<br>‚Ä¢ How great power wars or nuclear wars are different, and what can be done to prevent them<br>‚Ä¢ How much representative government helps to prevent war<br>‚Ä¢ And much more<br><br>Get this episode by subscribing to our podcast on the world‚Äôs most pressing problems and how to solve them: type 80,000 Hours into your podcasting app.<br><br><br>Producer: Keiran Harris<br>Audio mastering: Ben Cordell<br>Transcriptions: Katy Moore</blockquote></details><ul><li>Show notes link::

Because certainly once, evenl certainly after revolution was run, most americans didn't vote, couldn'tvote. Certainly they weren't holding george washington and the other founding fathers fully accountable in the years running up to the revolution. And what's interesting, and many historians have noted, is that most of the founding fathers had a big economic stake in independence, or a very particular lena, trade and an tax policy with britain. It's no coincidence. And coincident, a lot of the people who remained loyalists had economic stakes in union with britain and with the british policies that britain wanted to impose on the united states. And so that surely influenced, along with all the other more noble motives that played a role, both in their willingness to launch the revolution, but had also played a role his. Washington was a notorious land speculator. He was a consumer. Wanted the fanciest clothes, the fanciest carriages, the land trappings of wealth. He pursued tat his entire life.

So the ucranians refuse to compromise on their liberty. The american revolutionaries refuse to compromise on their liberty. And the tolibon refused to compromise, not so much on their liberty, but on a set of principles. The american administration, when dealing with the tolybon refused to compromise on a certain set of principles of justice and of a punishment of a grave crime. And so our intransigence on a principle is a kind of intangible incentive that essentially says, well, there's a bargain to be made that we should accept semi sovereignty as an american revolutionary or as a eucranian, because they are strong and we are weak, and i refuse. That is the sensible compromise.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#010323-commitment-problem><h3 id=010323-commitment-problem><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[01:03:23] Commitment Problem</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/fbe5cadc-ec0a-43d1-a95f-0a2e131d83ea rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (01:02:23 - 01:03:28)</a>

Basically, if you have two actors, and one is quickly becoming more powerful than the other, then the rising party would probably like to commit to not take too much of the pie, to not exploit the other party in future, because that would stop them from being attacked now. But no matter, no matter what they say, the declining power knows that it's going to be in the rising power's interest to take advantage of them in future. And so now the rising power could basically try to directly pay off the declining power now yeout to attack them, which which does apparently often happen. But if the rise, if their risin power, is too steep, then they may just not be able to afford sufficiently large payout to motivate the declining power not to engage in a preenptive strike in order to stop their rise.

In the casea, it goes back to this broader point about over centralized power being the root of accentuating all five kinds of conflict bicas mechanically is going to make leaders more inchecked and less likely internalized cost. But it means we're at the mercy of their misreceptions. We're at the mercy of their intangible incentives. There's more uncertainty. They can't commit, and so it just aggravates all thes arches of war. And i think that is, to me, a very plausible rational for why checked, highly checked and balanced societies very seldom go to war against any one, against one another. And when they do go to war, it's usually against a relatively unchecked society where they can't find a mutual bargaining range. But i'm careful to sort of talk in the book about these sort of checked and balance societies, rather democratic, because democratic people think t means, you know, most people s leap to thinking as the is the president elected or not? But then there's a lot of countries like liberia where wo're electing a dictator every five years. That's a slight exaggeration, but they're just not, they're not that checkd and balance. They have a lot of autonomy and and so an election for the executive is actually not the most important check for my prorspective for peace building. It's actually the division of power within the country, across branch os tho government, across levels of government in the country, anto these like supernational organizations. So anything that does that is going to make things more peaceable. So i totally by democratic peace theory.

Staff are paid minimum wage, lunch is bread and hummus, and you're all bunched up on a few tables in a basement office.<br><br>But over a few years, your cause attracts some major new donors. Your funding jumps a thousandfold, from $100,000 a year to $100,000,000 a year. You're the same group of people committed to making sacrifices for the cause ‚Äî but these days, rather than cutting costs, the right thing to do seems to be to spend serious money and get things done ASAP.<br><br>You suddenly have the opportunity to make more progress than ever before, but as well as excitement about this, you have worries about the impacts that large amounts of funding can have.<br><br>This is roughly the situation faced by today's guest Will MacAskill ‚Äî University of Oxford philosopher, author of the forthcoming book What We Owe The Future , and founding figure in the effective altruism movement.<br><br>Links to learn more, summary and full transcript.<br><br>Years ago, Will pledged to give away more than 50% of his income over his life, and was already donating 10% back when he was a student with next to no income. Since then, the coalition he founded has been super successful at attracting the interest of donors who collectively want to give away billions in the way Will and his colleagues were proposing.<br><br>While surely a huge success, it brings with it risks that he's never had to consider before:<br><br>‚Ä¢ Will and his colleagues might try to spend a lot of money trying to get more things done more quickly ‚Äî but actually just waste it.<br>‚Ä¢ Being seen as profligate could strike onlookers as selfish and disreputable.<br>‚Ä¢ Folks might start pretending to agree with their agenda just to get grants.<br>‚Ä¢ People working on nearby issues that are less flush with funding may end up resentful.<br>‚Ä¢ People might lose their focus on helping others as they get seduced by the prospect of earning a nice living.<br>‚Ä¢ Mediocre projects might find it too easy to get funding, even when the people involved would be better off radically changing their strategy, or shutting down and launching something else entirely.<br><br>But all these 'risks of commission' have to be weighed against 'risk of omission': the failure to achieve all you could have if you'd been truly ambitious.<br><br>People looking askance at you for paying high salaries to attract the staff you want is unpleasant.<br><br>But failing to prevent the next pandemic because you didn't have the necessary medical experts on your grantmaking team is worse than unpleasant ‚Äî it's a true disaster. Yet few will complain, because they'll never know what might have been if you'd only set frugality aside.<br><br>Will aims to strike a sensible balance between these competing errors, which he has taken to calling judicious ambition . In today's episode, Rob and Will discuss the above as well as:<br><br>‚Ä¢ Will humanity likely converge on good values as we get more educated and invest more in moral philosophy ‚Äî or are the things we care about actually quite arbitrary and contingent?<br>‚Ä¢ Why are so many nonfiction books full of factual errors?<br>‚Ä¢ How does Will avoid anxiety and depression with more responsibility on his shoulders than ever?<br>‚Ä¢ What does Will disagree with his colleagues on?<br>‚Ä¢ Should we focus on existential risks more or less the same way, whether we care about future generations or not?<br>‚Ä¢ Are potatoes one of the most important technologies ever developed?<br>‚Ä¢ And plenty more.<br><br>Get this episode by subscribing to our podcast on the world‚Äôs most pressing problems and how to solve them: type 80,000 Hours into your podcasting app.<br><br><br>Producer: Keiran Harris<br>Audio mastering: Ben Cordell<br>Transcriptions: Katy Moore</blockquote></details><ul><li>Show notes link::

On Today's Episode: Roughly 1% of the world is said to be millionaires, and the fraction of the worldwide population that are billionaires are even fewer. So, no bullsh*t, what does it take to become a billionaire, or even a millionaire. The answer comes down to habits and mindset. Ultra-successful people think and move differently from everyone else. You may have heard Jim Rohn‚Äôs quote, ‚Äúsuccessful people do what unsuccessful people are not willing to do.‚Äù This applies across the board. If billion dollar status is a goal, and being ultra wealthy and successful is high on your list of priorities, start today with your habits. Focus on the right things that create forward progress, ask the hard questions, and question everything. In this episode, 5 ultra-successful guests share what it takes and explain the inner workings and habits you can start to adopt and apply immediately. Dean Graziosi is an entrepreneur and investor that changed his life through real estate. Robin Sharma, former attorney turned leadership expert, has written books such as The 5 AM Club and The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari changed his life through spirituality. Ed Mylett is a peak performance expert and author of The Power of One More. Patrick Bet-David is the ultra-successful businessman from humble beginnings and author of Your Next Five Moves. Tim Ferris is an entrepreneur and investor that started the mega successful ‚Äú4-Hour‚Äù self help series among other popular best selling books. ‚ÄúIt is incredibly empowering to know that your future is in your hands.‚Äù Keanu Reeves SHOW NOTES: 0:00 | Introduction to Billionaire Habits 0:22 | Outsource Tasks That Don‚Äôt Make Money 22:43 | High Achievers Do This Every Morning 43:37 | Build Your Body Build Success 1:05:02 | Reflect on Your Life Every Day 1:27:47 | Build Creativity & Apply Application QUOTES: ‚ÄúWhat stands between us and where we want to go is never what we think it is.‚Äù Dean Graziosi [6:59] ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter how many zeros are at the end or how big your company is, the pain is still there, [‚Ä¶] when your company's got 3 zeros, or nine zeros, or ten zeros, the stress and the worry is almost the same when you look back.‚Äù Dean Graziosi [21:39] ‚ÄúPeople might ridicule you, [‚Ä¶] people might throw stones at you, but use them to build monuments of mastery‚Ä¶‚Äù Robin Sharma [33:24] ‚ÄúIt all starts with who you are because you‚Äôll never rise any higher than what‚Äôs going on within you.‚Äù Robin Sharma [33:59] ‚ÄúYou can play with your phone, or you can be monomaniacally focused on being a history maker and legendary, you don‚Äôt get to do both.‚Äù Robin Sharma [41:36] ‚ÄúIdentity is the governor on our lives.

This is who you are. And i had a other person, to my benefit, pointing out to me the things that were great about me. This is going to sound hoky, but i'm going to give you the big one, and this is why life gives you these great tests. I had a really good friend of mine, i went to lunch, and he said, i don't know who this guy is here in front of me, ind he goes the mass. You question honestly right now, what are you grateful for? And at the lunch i said, jack, shit, nothing, brother. There's nothing good in my life right now. And i'm not exaggerating this to you when i tell you this, and this is a factual story, as i'm mouthing these words, people walked in with an older man. Both of them clearly were fighting cancer. Somehow both had lost their hair. One of the ladies had a bonnet on. And they were barely moving in both, walked by our table and gave me the most warm greeting, the warmest smile, as a stranger. Anigos, that's pretty frick and pathetic. You can't find anything your life to be grateful for right now. And on the drive home, i'm not kidding you, i started to stack gratitude. I started to take inventory. Because if you can find things to be grateful for in that space, man, is your life going to be rich when there really are external things to be grateful for. So my first mechanism out of that space was, honestly, to stack the things i was grateful for. And i started reinforcing it over and over and over again.

Well, i think everything in our bot, i think everything in our lives, starts with our body. If you're a person of faith, you believe that's where your soul is housed, right? And so it's the you you do emotions. You don't just feel them, you do them. In other words, and you know this from things you've learned in your life, but like, joy is an actual action, not just an emotion. We feel a certain joy. There's a certain breathing, a certain movement in our body. Depression and sadness is something we do. We're more hunched over. Our breathing is more shallow, right? And so there's a correlation between the way you move your body and your emotions. There directly. This is even before we get to dopamen hits and our nervous system being. I'm just telling you that the way you move your body is an emotion. You do emotions. And so when you move your body, you can't be in full workout mode, moving your body, running, king, jumping jacks, jump rope, and be depressed. They don't go together simultines because your body doesn't get the connectionn i'm moving like i'm joyful. I'm moving like i'm having sex. I'm moving like i'm happy. These are all joyful states. You can't be depressed simultaneously. So the quickest way to change our behavior, our emotions and our state is with our body.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#1125-identity-drives-your-behaviors><h3 id=1125-identity-drives-your-behaviors><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[11:25] Identity Drives Your Behaviors</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/982c1b77-d8d1-4711-80fa-13d3db67fa31 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (09:58 - 11:23)</a>

Once that temperature is set at a certain degree, everything in the world, externally, can hit it. And you will find a way to get that temperature. So even in this house, let's say it's set at 80 degrees, if we opened up all the doors in cold air, just the worst things in life, the blizzard of life, came in, the thermostat will kick the heater and will regulate this room back to 80 degrees. The reverse is also true. It's a super hot day. Great things are happening in your life. It's getting hotter and hotter and hotter. If you're at 80 degrees, that internal therm stet will find a way, over a window of time, to cool your life right back down to 80 degrees again.

And those are the people who like you the most, and those are the people who would really want you to be successful. And if they're not coming back, then no one's going to come back. Ah. And so i think number one, tracking return usage is realy important. Number two, track n p s. There's all kinds of tools to do this now. Or n p s. Some people say forty. I think about 50. It's above 50, then you'd probably cheap prot market fit m n p s. If you ever answerd that question, would you recommend this proter service to a friend? That's n p s. It's one question. You rank from zero to ten. A basically the percentage of people who answer nine or ten, those are a promoters. The percentage of people who answer zero to six, those are detractors. And people who answer seven or eight are thrown out. So in the early days a weble had an m p s of 80 %. That was basically 88 % of people answered nine or ten, eight % of people answered zero to six. And by matthew's right, 12 % of people answered seven or eight. So ba, takea 88 % minus eight % equals 80. If it's above 50, you're doing pretty well. M the way thismetric is built, it can get negative, and that's probably where it will start. A, and the number three, paying customer renewal rate. S when you have paying customers, look at their renewal rates. Um, a quick side bar, i don't like the churn metric for looking at this. A lot of people use that because it's easier to calculate. Ah, but basically, churn is not cohort base. Renewals cohort based. Um, so churn is just looking at number subscribers lost, divided by a toa act of subscribers in any given period. I don't like that, because if you're a denominator, m is changing like less at you're growing really rally quickly. Your denominar is changing fast. In eununumerator, the numerators based on last year's denominator.

And that's cohort base. So i like renewal rates a lot better. All right, a next a metrick that aren't included. So number one metrick that is not included is sign ups. This is something that was not very well understood when we got started. I would not pay that much attention to sign ups. I would pay a lot of attention to active users. U if you have good returning usage, and sign ups translates the active users pretty well. If you have bad returning usage, then sign up basically like completely drops off, and you have very little active users. In fact, that number may even be shrinking, even when your stiamps are growing, if people aren't returning. A number two, conversion rate. If if you're thinking of building a sas business, conversion rates, they all start low. They build over time. I wouldn't pay a lot of attention to conversion rate in the beginning. I'd pay attention to some of the other metrics. A, i think it's the last point. Just how does it feel when you get product market fit? Ah, you'll know when you achieved it when your customers are beating a path to your door. A, when you don't have it, everything feels hard. It feels like you're pushing this huge rock up a mountain. You're a pushing your customers towards the solution. They're too nice to tell you no, but they're not really coming back. They're not really using it. When you have it, the whole world is beating a path to your door. Everyone wants to use it. Ah, pressis writing about it. Everything feels easy, and every decision you make feels like you're a genius, because they all go, well, ah, you know, t spoiler alert, it's somewhere in between. Ah, it turns out that, you know, as you're scaling your business overtime, you'll discover, ah, you're maybe a little less smart than you thought you were. Ah, but, but, but, that comes later. A but, i think this is what it feels like. So if you're not feeling that, you know, sort of, customers pulling you in a direction world, you know, beating a path to your door, then you probably don't have it yet. All right, now, a couple more points. A beyond prok market fit, this is a little bit more theoretical.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#3621-scaling-the-team><h3 id=3621-scaling-the-team><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[36:21] Scaling the Team</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/41390d36-d7bf-40d1-b088-7f774521cdbd rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (34:30 - 36:23)</a>

I also discuss the efficacy and mechanisms behind OCD treatments‚Äîboth behavioral and pharmacologic as well as holistic and combination treatments and new emerging treatments, including directed brain stimulation. I explain the neural circuitry underlying repetitive ‚Äúthought-action loops‚Äù and why in OCD, the compulsive actions merely make the obsessions even stronger. I review cognitive-behavioral therapies like exposure therapy and SSRIs, holistic approaches, and nutraceuticals, detailing the efficacy of each approach and what science says about how to combine and sequence treatments. I describe an often effective approach for treating OCD where clinicians use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to deliberately bring patients into states of high anxiety while encouraging them to suppress compulsive actions in order to help them learn to overcome repetitious thought/action cycles. This episode should interest anyone with OCD, anyone who knows someone with OCD or OCPD, and more generally, those interested in how the brain works to control thoughts and actions, whether those thoughts are intrusive or not.<br>Thank you to our sponsors AG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman<br>Thesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman<br>Eight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman<br>Supplements from Momentous https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman .<br>For the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com .<br>Timestamps (00:00:00) Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)<br>(00:03:01) Momentous Supplements, AG1 (Athletic Greens), Thesis, Eight Sleep<br>(00:08:28) What is OCD and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder?<br>(00:11:18) OCD: Major Incidence & Severity<br>(00:15:10) Categories of OCD<br>(00:21:33) Anxiety: Linking Obsessions & Compulsions<br>(00:27:33) OCD & Familial Heredity<br>(00:29:10) Biological Mechanisms of OCD, Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loops<br>(00:39:36) Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loop & OCD<br>(00:46:39) Clinical OCD Diagnosis, Y-BOCS Index<br>(00:51:38) OCD & Fear, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) & Exposure Therapy<br>(01:01:56) Unique Characteristics of CBT/Exposure Therapy in OCD Treatment<br>(01:10:18) CBT/Exposure Therapy & Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)<br>(01:22:30) Considerations with SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments<br>(01:25:17) Serotonin & Cognitive Flexibility, Psilocybin Studies<br>(01:31:50) Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators<br>(01:36:09) OCD & Cannabis, THC & CBD<br>(01:39:29) Ketamine Treatment<br>(01:41:43) Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)<br>(01:46:22) Cannabis CBD & Focus<br>(01:47:50) Thoughts Are Not Actions<br>(01:51:27) Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA<br>(02:00:55) Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD<br>(02:03:28) Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine<br>(02:09:45) OCD vs. Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder<br>(02:20:53) Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions<br>(02:31:00) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter<br>Title Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac<br>Disclaimer</blockquote></details><ul><li>Show notes link::

To day we are talking about obscessive compulsive disorder, or o c d. We are also going to talk about obsessive compulsive personality disorder, which, as you will soon learn, is distinct from obsessive compulsive disorder. In fact, many people that refer to themselves or others as obsessive or compulsive, or having o c d, or o c d about this, or o c d about that, do not have clinically diagnosil o c d. Rather, many people have obsessive compulsive personality disorder. However, there are many people in the world that have actual o c d. And for those people there is a tremendous amount of suffering. In fact, o c d turns out to be number seven on the list of most debilitating illnesses, not just psychiatric illnesses, but of all illnesses, which is remarkable and somewhat frightening. The good news is, thanks to the fields of psychiatry, psychology and science in general, there are now excellent treatments for o c d.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#1207-obsessive-compulsive-personality-disorder><h3 id=1207-obsessive-compulsive-personality-disorder><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[12:07] Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/bd32cda6-2021-4063-a8a3-6c8f0b72e39c rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (10:34 - 12:09)</a>

Is very different than obsessive compulsive personality disorder, which mainly involves a sense of delayed gratification that people want and somewhat en oy because it allows them to function better or more in line with how they would like to show up in the world. So again, o c d has mainly to do with obsessions that are intrusive and recurrent. Whereas obsessive compulsive personality disorder does not have that intrusive feature to it. People do not mind, or in fact, often invite or like the particular terns of thought that lead them to be compulsive along certain dimensions. So leaving aside obsessive compulsive personality disorder for the moment, let's focus a bit more on o c d and define how it tends to show up in the world. First of all, o c d is extremely common. In fact, current estimates are that anywhere from two point five % to as high as three or even four % of people suffer from true o c d. That is an astonishingly high number. Now the reason the range is so big, two point five % all the way up to three or maybe even four %, is that a lot of the features of o c d go unnoticed, both in the clinitions office and simply because people don't report it and don't talk about it. In fact, it is possible to have recurrent and intrusive obsessions and not engage in the sorts of behaviours that would ever allow people to notice that somebody has o c d.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#2602-anxiety-and-the-right-hand-turn><h3 id=2602-anxiety-and-the-right-hand-turn><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[26:02] Anxiety and the Right Hand Turn</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/c81c61c9-7b28-42b3-ba0e-96d4e8cda1da rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (24:33 - 26:01)</a>

But then by taking a right hand turn, again, in this one particular example, by taking a right hand turn, there is a very brief, i should mention, very brief, relief of that anxiety at the time of the decision to right, not left. And there's an additional drop in anxiety while one takes the right hand turn, as opposed to the left hand turn. And then, as i alluded to before, there's a reinforcement of the compulsion. In other words, by going right, it doesn't create a situation in thebr n and psychology of the person that, ah, you know what, i'm not anxious any more. Left would have probably been ok. It reinforces the idea that right made me feel better, or turning right made me feel better, and going left would have been that much worse. Again, it reinforces the obsession even further. And again, we could swap out right turns and left turns with something like hand washing. The feeling that something is contaminated and the need to wash one's hands, even though one already wash their hands 20, 30, 50 times prior nd were ae.

And there's also an issue of depression.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#5717-cognitive-behavioral-theory><h3 id=5717-cognitive-behavioral-theory><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[57:17] Cognitive Behavioral Theory</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/856bc8c1-dfa1-4e02-9ae5-8190118f7492 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (55:45 - 57:21)</a>

So whereas typically some one would feel the obsession with, i don't want to turn left ecause something bad i's going o happen, someone's going to die, and then they turn right, they never get the option or the opportunity to really explore what would happen were they to turn left, or to not be able to turn right.

And that's actually what the clinition is. After cogni behavior therapy and exposure therapy, in the context of o c d, most often involves trying to get people to tolerate, not relieve, their anxiety. This is extremely important, and i realize there's variation to this depending on the style of cogni behavior therapy, the style of exposure therapy, but almost across the board, the goal, again, is to get people to feel the anxiety that normally they are able to at least partially relieve, however briefly, by engaging in the compulsion.

Here it's the opposite. What they're trying to get the patient to do is to really feel the anxiety at its maximum, but then do the exact opposite of whatever the normal compulsion is. So if normally the compulsion is to wash one's hands, then the idea is to suppressed hand washing while being in the experience of the utmost anxiety.

One of the powerful elements of treatment for o c d is to really support the patient and make them realize that thoughts are just thoughts, and that everyone has disturbing thoughts, and that oftentimes those disturbing thoughts arise at the most inconvenient and sometimes what seems like the most inappropriate circumstances.

But i think it is fair to say that obcessive compulsive disorder, whether not in mild, moderate or severe form, is impairing normal functioning. Whereas opsessive compulsive personality disorder, there is a range of expressions of that, some of which can be adaptive, some of which can be maladaptive. And again, it's all going to depend on context. Before we conclude, i do want to touch on something that i think a lot of people experience, and that's superstitions. Superstitions are fascinating. And there's some fascinating research on superstitions. One particular study that i'm a big fan of is the work of benslevski at harvard. He studies motor sequences and motor learning. And he as beautiful data on how people learn, for instance, a tennis swing, and the patterns that they engage in early on, and then the patterns of swinging that they swing in the racket, that is, that they engage in later as they acquire more skill. And basically the take away is that the amount of error, or variation from swing to swing is dramatically reduced as they acquire skill. That's all fine and good, and there's some beautiful, a mechanistic data that he and others have discovered to support how that comes to be.

If you've ever watched a game of baseball, you've seen this before. Oftentimes the pitcher up on the mound will bring the ball to their chin, they'll look over their shoulder, they'll look back over the other shoulder, and then they will, of course, reel back and pitch the ball. But if you watch closely, oftentimes there are components in the motor sequence which are completely unrelated to the pitch. They are not looking necessarily to see if someone stealing a base. They're not necessarily looking down at home plate where the batter is. They're doing things like touching the back of their ear before they bring the ball to their chin, or adjusting their hat. And if you watch individual pitchers, what you'll find is that they'll do the same sequence of completely irrelevant motor patterns before each and every single pitch.

I don't know what their thought process is. Now i also don't know what the rat is thinking, but the rat is clearly doing something, or thinking something, is related to the final outcome. I don't know of any studies where they've intervened with the particular superstition, like behaviors of the rat, to see whether or not the rat somehow doesn't continue to do the motor sequence to get the pellet. We don't know ther rats. I don't speak rat. Most people don't. Or if you speak to a rat, if it speaks, is not in english.

While a political debate rages around the topic of gun control, it remains important to understand the causes and possible remedies for gun violence within the current system. Andrew Papachristos is a sociologist who uses applied network science to study patterns of street violence in urban areas. His research shows that such violence is highly non-random; knowing something about the social networks of perpetrators and victims can help identify who might be at heightened risk of gun violence. It‚Äôs an interesting example of applying ideas from mathematics and computer science to real-world social situations.<br>Support Mindscape on Patreon .<br>Andrew Papachristos received his Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Chicago. He is currently a professor of sociology at Northwestern University, and a faculty fellow at the Institute for Policy Research.

What keeps chicago unique? A, one of the things, outside of segregation, racest housing policies and all the things that kind of cre neighborhoods that have high crime rates and keepin that way, is its history of gangs in this city, which is um fundamentally different than some of those other cities. L a had a similar history, as did new york, but their gangs didn't, a, grow as big and as pervasive as chicagos in terms of the level of organization and polit politicaliation. And that still lingers to this day, am guns. Chicago recovers more guns. There are more guns in chicago than there are in new york or la. And part of that is a, not necessarily the city's gun laws or the states, but our proximity to states like indiana, which is where a second largest source of guns come from, which is, is largely a cash and carry state. And the two other ones, which are really important, and there are others, one is the continued dominance of a a political machine system, which is slowly changed over time, but, you know, that's part of what keeps crime in some neighborhoods and not in other neighborhoods.

So when i'm talking the networks are created through ances of coarest or being stopped together by the police. So it is actually setting aside anything around culpability. It's an observation made by police a point in time and space. Um, you know, there are biases in police data which are important. We're able to see a lot of those. So, say, failure to comply, often is something that's officer base. Robbery, assault, arson, things like that, tend to be come to the attention of police from civilians. So we take all those things to account. But basically, if you and i somebody together, we have a tie. And then if i, you know, committ an assault with somebody else, we have a tie. And you string these things together, and it creates actually, a network of of a risky behaviors, right? Things that are inherently you and i engaging in a behavior that could be risky. So, but your comment about victim and suspect, or people that are involved. M, i focus mainly on victims. One, because in chicago we have abysmally low clearance rates. But more to the point, violence prevention is about saving lives. And focusing on ho's in harm's way, who is experiencing trama, is the kind of most immediately actionable information. And we generally have all the information about who was injured. And from a public health standpoint, it shouldn't matter whether you have a felany conviction, or, you know, our bad parent, or you dropped out o none of that should matter if you're focusing on saving somebody's life.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#5200-the-science-of-contact-tracing><h3 id=5200-the-science-of-contact-tracing><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[52:00] The Science of Contact Tracing</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/36cab423-ddf6-4caa-a167-5fc88c8943b4 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (50:11 - 52:04)</a>

The motive, one of the motivations of this is, amost a huge baseball fan. We talked about mony ball, and i kind of realize that baseball has changed so much, i since due to the mony ball revolution. When i was a kid, the game of baseball looked different, like the infielders all stood in the same spot in every play. And now every play the infielders are all over the place. There's something he infield shift, which data scientists discovered was actually a better way. It looks insane, but you put most the infielders on one side of the field, it actually leads to better outcomes. And iwas think about, like, our personal lives, and i feel like most of us don't really use data driven, make data driven decisions. We generally do what feels about right and go with our gut s a kind what would a a data, what w would a data driven a life be like? And i think the area where there's the clearest and the monyball analogy extends best is dating a. So tha, there have been studies. There's a work by samantha joel where she studied 11 thousand romantic couples. And she had, ever she worked with 85 other scientists. She had every possible trait you could measure on them, their sexual tastes, their demographics, their values a, their physical appearance, as ranked by other people. And she and how happy they reported being in that relationship. And she and the other scientists used machine learning to try to find what is it about a person that predicts ou 're going to be happy in a relationship with them? And the overarching lesson is that it's incredibly hard to predict who makes someone happy. Like it's shockingly unpredictable. You would think that, like many qualities about a person would dramatically improve the odds they make you happy. And it seems in the datas, it's there are some things that moderately improve the odds, but they're not that big. And the striking thing about that study is you contrast that with scholars have studied on line dating, and they've mined through, you know, everybody's cliques and messages, and they saya what makes someone desirable in on line dating. And that is incredibly easy to predict. So its it. It may be hard to predict who's a good romantic partner, but it is so easy to predict who's desirable partner. In fact, they can even predict with high accuracy, not just whether you'r going to swipe left or right, but how long it's going to take you to swipe left or right.

So, like we're just lemings on these online sits, and what predicts a, someone's more likely to be clicked? It's they're beautiful. Not surprising. That's by far the biggest predictor. It explains conventionally attractive people a way more desirable.

Certain occupations, not in women and men, lawyers, people in the ltary a do wegh better. In online dating. Students do horribly. I spent most o my life as a student and did horribly in dating. And now i know the reason for that. A, people work in transportation. A, inhospitality, disaster for men on dating sites, a similarity to oneselfa, people are drawnt. There's there's this idea that people are drawn to opposites. It's totally not true. On just about every dimension scholars can measure, people are drawn to people who are similar themselves, even on silk seemly silly things like how many photos you include in your profile.

This week, as we prepare to mark Independence Day in the United States, we revisit our 2018 conversation with Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Annette Gordon-Reed .

At one point, a young slave is brought over from the united states. She is actual the sister of robert hemmings, who was by his side as he drafted the declaration of independence. Who was she and what did she become to jefferson? Well,</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br><br>sally hemmings, sarah, a nicknamed sally, was sister to robert annd james. She had been something of a companion to jefferson's so she went along, and she was 14. And while she was there, we don't know when she became jeffersons. And their son says, concubine is the term that he uses. And she became pregnant by jefferson, and she wanted to stay in france. By the time jefferson ink that he wants to come home, she wanted to stay. And actually, all the young people in the hotel de langiac wanted to stay in france. Nobody wanted to go home. But jefferson promised her that if she came back with him, she would have a good life at montecallo, and their children would be freed when they were 21 years old. So she agreed to that. She was 16 years old at the time, and she came back to virginia with jefferson.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br><br>So for us, at least with the vantage of history, this seems almost incomprehensible as a decision. Why would you give up essentially freedom in france to come back and be a slave in virginia? I</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br><br>thought about quite a bit when i wrote my first book. That was sort of a point of mystery for me, about sally hemmings. But when i started writing the hemmings o monticello and working on that, and i realized how important family was or i began to think about how important family would have been to some one like that, a 16 year old female raised to believe that she had some special connection to family. In a way, to think about family, think about your mother is back in virginia. Her sisters and brothers were there. So that would be an impetus an that was sort of a dilemma that many slave people faced. Do you run away and have freedom by yourself, or do you stay and stick it out with your family? The other thing to consider is that jefferson treated sally hemmings and her sisters and brothers very differently than he did the other aves on the mountain.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#1738-early-age-of-consent-is-hard-to-confront-but-normal-in-those-times><h3 id=1738-early-age-of-consent-is-hard-to-confront-but-normal-in-those-times><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[17:38] Early Age of Consent is Hard to Confront But Normal in Those Times</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/e95853b8-296c-4dec-83b0-f4b6d753ef24 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 17secÔ∏è (16:30 - 16:48)</a>

And in those days, it was much more than father knows best what he said would go, because he was the head of the household. I think it is also important to remember that jefferson had two surviving daughters with his wife, who died in 17 82. So i think he handled it by being the boss, and it was the kind of thing that people would not question. So he had basically the freedom to impose a kind of order on this place that everybody went along with. Plus, you have to remember, i think we have to remember, that he wasn't married. And the idea that a man would have a mistress or a companion, or that he would have a set up like this, was normal in virginia. It was not considered crazy. A one of jefferson's friends that it was a common practice for a widowed or bachelor slave owners to take an enslaved woman as, and he uses the phrase, a substitute for a wife. Obviously, she couldn't be a wife, because they couldn't marry black people. And white people could not get married. Well, until 19 67, in virginia. So that was out of the question. But this was something that happened in slavery, an it's hard for us to wrap our minds around, just as it might be hard for us to wrap our minds around about slavery in general.

And so one very well known example is southwest airlines. They were running out of money early in their operations. They were using four jets at the time, and they couldn't make their pay roll. So they had to sell one of the jets to pay employees that month. And they went to employees and said, we're going to sell one of our jets, but we want to run the same routes with three jets instead of four. How can we do that? And employees came back with the idea of turning the planes more quickly than they were before. So southwest now continues to be known for its turn time, the amount of time it takes to come back in the gate, unload passen s and bags, you know, clean the plane, reload passengers and bags and take off. And that's part of southwest' sort of deep strategy. So that story got told not just for the substance that turn time is important, but for the relationship between n leaders and employees and who actually came up with the idea.

Today‚Äôs episode is all about why we are unique when it comes to sleep.¬†<br>When we compare our sleep to that of all other primates, humans stand out in two ways. First, we spend far less time asleep, and second, and in bloody remarkable üòÇ contrast, humans get more than double the amount of REM sleep.<br>Unlike many other primates, we humans are exclusively ground (or bed!) sleepers. In contrast, primates usually sleep arboreally, meaning in the branches of trees. During REM sleep, to prevent acting out our dreams, the brain paralyzes the body. But this is far too dangerous to do if you are sleeping up in the trees, lest you fall fatally down to earth.<br>Homo erectus, as the first obligate biped and, with fire to deter predators and blood-sucking insects, was able to sleep fairly safely on the ground. However, fire didn‚Äôt eradicate all the risks. This forced another [bloody] remarkable change: hominids had to become far more efficient in their sleep and thus shorter duration of sleep.¬†<br>T his re-engineering of human sleep became one of the triggers that rocketed Homo sapiens to the top of the evolutionary pyramid due to REM sleep‚Äôs supercharging of 1) our socioemotional, allowing us to form the cooperative societies that formed the basis of modern civilizations, and 2) cognitive intelligence, particularly our creativity, which was the fuel to our brain-derived engine of ingenuity that helped in the great advances of civilization.¬†<br>‚ÄúSimply put: we sleep, therefore, we are.‚Äù¬†<br>Sleep really is bloody remarkable.¬†<br>Please note that Matt is not a medical doctor, and none of the content in this podcast should be considered medical advice in any way, shape, or form, nor prescriptive in any way.<br>One of the sponsors of today s podcast is the biochemical electrolyte drink company LMNT , and they are very kindly offering eight free sample packs when you purchase any one of their orders at drinklmnt.com/mattwalker .

Nowin last such episode, we spoke at length about one a bloody remarkable thing called half brain sleep. Well, to day is all about the equally remarkable fact that when it comes to dream sleep, we humans are special. And i mean very special indeed. I'm even going to propose that this unique aspect of human sleep is one of many reasons that justifies our homined name. Because the term homo sapiens is derived from the latin root meaning wise person. And i'll come back to that in just a second, but let's return to sleep. Here is how we are special. Compared to old and new world monkeys as well as apes such as chimpanzees and gorillas. Human sleep sticks out like a proverbial sore thumb in terms of slumber. Or i should actually say two sore thumbs. As first, we are unique in the sense that the total amount of time that we spend asleep is significantly shorter than all other primates. We will typically average around eight hours relative to somewhere between ten to 15 ous of sleep that we've measured in all other primates. The second thing, however, is that, in striking contrast, we humans have a staggering and disproportionate amount of rem sleep, of dream sleep. Because if you look all other primates, if you average them together, will come in at around about nine % of the sleep time dedicated to rem sleep. But in humans, that number is somewhere between 20 to 25 % of all our sleep time being dedicated to rem sleep, dreaming.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#0842-sleeping-in-trees-meant-less-rem-sleep><h3 id=0842-sleeping-in-trees-meant-less-rem-sleep><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[08:42] Sleeping in Trees Meant Less REM Sleep</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/1bfbafe8-5b34-485c-8729-cd64da56a96c rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (06:40 - 08:42)</a>

And this is where homo actus enters our story. Homo erectus was the predecessor of us, homo sapient. And homo erectus was the first obligate biped, meaning that they could walk freely upright on two legs, rather than mbering along on their hands and feet. And we believe that it was homo erectus that was the first dedicated ground sleeper. And with the advent of fire to deter large carnivore predators, and also the smoke from the fire, which pro ded a night time fumigation that repelled small insects, it enabled homo erectus to come out of the trees and sleep safely on the ground at night. Now, fire was not a perfect solution, however, ground sleeping would have remained somewhat risky.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#ido-portal-the-science--practice-of-movement--huberman-lab-episode-77><h1 id=ido-portal-the-science--practice-of-movement--huberman-lab-episode-77><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Ido Portal: The Science & Practice of Movement | Huberman Lab Episode 77</h1></a><p><img src="https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmegaphone.imgix.net%2Fpodcasts%2F042e6144-725e-11ec-a75d-c38f702aecad%2Fimage%2FHuberman-Lab-Podcast-Thumbnail-3000x3000.png%3Fixlib%3Drails-2.1.2%26max-w%3D3000%26max-h%3D3000%26fit%3Dcrop%26auto%3Dformat%2Ccompress&w=200&h=200" width=200 alt=Cover|200></p><a href=#episode-metadata-28><h2 id=episode-metadata-28><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Episode Metadata</h2></a><ul><li>Episode title:: <a class="internal-link broken">Huberman Lab Episode 77</a></li><li>Show:: <a class="internal-link broken">Huberman Lab</a></li><li>Owner / Host:: <a class="internal-link broken">Scicomm Media</a></li><li>Episode link::

Ido has spent a lifetime studying, combining and evolving elements from an enormous range of martial arts, dance genres, athletic endeavors, and science, to develop a unified theory and practice of movement called ‚ÄúThe Ido Portal Method.‚Äù Here we discuss all things movement, including the role of the nervous system, reflexive versus deliberate movement patterns, and the link between emotions and awareness in movement. We also discuss learning and neuroplasticity, the mind-body connection and how movement itself can be leveraged toward expanding other types of skillscognitive, creative and otherwise. As one of the most sought out teachers of movement alive today, the knowledge Ido shares in this conversation can benefit everyone‚Äîchildren, adults, athletes, dancers, clinicians and trainers and the everyday person.<br>Thank you to our sponsors AG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman<br>ROKA: https://www.roka.com - code "huberman"<br>Helix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman<br>Supplements from Momentous https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman .<br>For the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com .<br>Timestamps (00:00:00) Ido Portal, Movement & Movement Practice<br>(00:03:30) AG1 (Athletic Greens), ROKA, Helix Sleep<br>(00:07:49) What is Movement?<br>(00:10:56) Movement & the Body-Mind Connection<br>(00:14:47) Entry Points to Movement<br>(00:18:08) Early Education in Movement: Awareness, Play & Examination<br>(00:21:19) Stillness, Movement & the Environment, Playfulness<br>(00:31:34) Unique Postures, Types of Movement, Contents vs. Containers<br>(00:40:50) Discomfort: Marker of Movement, Failures & Learning<br>(00:47:05) Movement Diversity, Squat Challenge, Injury, Movement Evolution<br>(00:56:36) Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change<br>(01:02:04) Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution<br>(01:12:39) Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement as Language, Consilience<br>(01:21:39) Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise<br>(01:26:36) Potential for Movement, ‚ÄúHumming‚Äù<br>(01:32:18) Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees of Freedom<br>(01:35:50) Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity<br>(01:38:06) Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness<br>(01:48:28) Hearing & Movement<br>(01:52:43) Walking Gaits<br>(01:56:55) Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness<br>(02:03:05) Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity to Others, Play & Discomfort<br>(02:18:13) Visualization & Experience, Feedback<br>(02:20:14) Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination<br>(02:31:45) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter<br>Title Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac<br>Disclaimer</blockquote></details><ul><li>Show notes link::

And we have to be very careful these, these habits and these directions. They come from, many times, good intention, but they are the devil. Many times they turn into the devil, just like our technology nowadays. And what is happening with people with depression, with meaning, meaninglessness, also with the body in various perspectives. Or even, i will also flip it into high performance sports and the ther price. Because for me, this is not a movement practice. It erases the person in the centre of it.

The more i learn from the more i'm thinking that that statement really should be extended to all of life. And i love to remind people, because i start off as a developmental norbiologist, that development doesn't start and end. You don't have childhood and adulthood. Our life is one long developmental arc from birth until death, however long that might be.

But because these ideas that he put forward spread as fast as they did and as globally as they did, literally, it's a hundred and forty years since marks died. And in that time, his ideas have become major types of thinking in every country on the earth. Ah, if you know much about the great ideas of human tory, ah, that's an extraordinary spread in an extraordinarily short period of historical time. And what that has meant, that speed of spread and that geographic diversity, is that the marxian ideas eracted with very different cultural histories, religious histories and economic conditions. So the end result was that the ideas were interpreted differently in different places at different times. And therefore, marxism, as a kind of first flush definition, is the totality of all these very different ways of coming to terms with it. For the first roughly forty, 50 years, marxism was te tradition of thinking critically about capitalism. Marks himself, that's all he really did. He never wrote a book about communism. He never wrote a book really about socialism either. His comments were occasional, fragmentary, dispersed. What he was really interested in was a critical analysis of capitalism. And that's what marxism was more or less in its first forty or 50 years.</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br><br>A</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 5</b><br><br>the only qualification</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br><br>of what i just said was something that happened in paris for a few weeks in 18 71, there was a collapse of the french government consequent upon losing a war to bismarck's germany.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#1553-marxism-is-a-critique-of-capitalism-and-we-can-do-better><h3 id=1553-marxism-is-a-critique-of-capitalism-and-we-can-do-better><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[15:53] Marxism is a Critique of Capitalism and We Can Do Better</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/2de666e7-a95c-48d2-a7de-1d94c639b55c rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (13:43 - 15:53)</a>

Anyway, the importance in terms of marxism is that now, this seizure of power by a group of marxists, that is, a group of people inspired by marks, developing what you might call a russian even though there were differences among the sians too, but a russian interpretation. This now has to be transformed from a critique of capitalism into a plan, at least, what are you going to do in the soviet union? And a lot of this was then trial and error. Mark never laid any of this out.

And that's really quite a frightening thing to lize, very it's a very frightening thing to realize. When you really realize it, it's like, oh, ohoh, this is real. And it's even worse than that. It's like te it's the precondition for the idea of reality itself, which i that's really real, right? I mean, you've got real that's nothing.

And that's really something to understand as well. You know, scientists, i talked to richard dawkins when i was at oxford, you know, and one of the things that characterizes dawkins is that dawkins believes that the truth will set you free. That is not a scientific presupposition. That is a religious presupposition, but it also might be the religious presupposition without which science is not possible. Because all the scientists i know whoare real scientists, they're unthey abide by the truth to an unbelievable degree. You know, if you're a social scientist and you have a data set in front of you, you know, say, 200 columns of 500 rows, you know, a complex data set, an there are a lot of ways you can get that to talk to you statistically. And you make thousands of decisions when you're doing a statistical analysis. And every single one of those is an ethical decision. And one of the decisions is, whell do i priotize my career, or do i priortize my pursuit of the truth? And often those are antagonistic, because if you have a big daticet, you want to discover something in it, and maybe there's nothing there, and then you've wasted two years, and that's pretty hard on your career.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#5236-how-small-chimps-become-alpha-mutual-reciprocity><h3 id=5236-how-small-chimps-become-alpha-mutual-reciprocity><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[52:36] How Small Chimps Become Alpha (Mutual Reciprocity)</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/b96e3c4b-5a97-401a-89f9-7656966cec20 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (50:38 - 52:34)</a>

It's like while franz de wall's been studying chimps for 30 years, and that's not true. That is not what happens. He told me flat out that frequently, small male can become alpha, especially if he has the support of a influential female. And the small male becomes elphop and has the support of the influential female, not because he expresses arbitrary power, but because he's unbelievably good at mutual reciprocation. And so he has friends, and he does things for his friends, and they do things for him, and they trust each other. And he has lots of friends, which also means he has no enemies, which turns out to be really important. Because the brute chimps, like the cyclopath elphus, they do rule now and then, but they get torn to shreds by their enemies, because, you know, they're tough, let's say, and mean, but they have day and two chimps they stamped a week before, ally together and tear them, literally tear them into shreds. And so the the psychopath chimp types who use power to attain dominance, have very short rules and end in a very bloody way. And de wall has pointed out, like pge did among children, that power is an unstable a ethic upon which to base the social hierarchy, even for chimps. And chimps are male dominated, they have a patriarchal society, and they're relatively brutal, and it doesn't even work for them. It certainly doesn't work for human beings. So whatever is at the apex of the pyramid, it's not, as the bloody marxists insist, you know, the raw expression of powerand and exploitation. Wrong, wrong. Not the case. Doesn't even work in nature. Doesn't work for rats, doesn't work for panzes, certainly doesn't work for people.

Doesn't work for rats, doesn't work for panzes, certainly doesn't work for people. And then there is a kind of natural ethic that emerges out of that, right? Because with rats and with chimps and other social animals, it varies to some degree from species to species, thereis the necessity for something like mutual reciprocity as the basis for successful social organization. And that some thin like, treat your neighbor like you would want to be treated. It's something like that. It's the behavior equivalent of that. Now, ass earlier, you know, from whence does the highest injunction emerge or e when comes d yet yt. Well, it's strange, right? Some of it's bought em up. It's like, even among animals, mutual reciprocity seems to be a cardinal organizing feature, even done in the spirit of play, interestingly enough, ecause play is a mammalian universal. And that's kind of bot em up. But then at the same time, this, this, i suppose, pertains to the role, of the mysterious role of consciousness in the world. It's like, while we're also aware of this, right? And we also, we also think about it abstractly as a good and we don't only learn it bottom up, we also conceptiualize it top down. And then they meet. And that is, that's moses coming down the mountain with the tablets. And so what did he meet on the mountain? Well, god, whell. He met whatever's at the highest place.

It's there im in terms of sam, one of the things that i haven't heard you talk about too much, but there's something about what you said with him that that brings it up to me, is that he sees this hierarchy, or this the sa religious structure, has a totalitarian impulse, and it is a kind of structure that comes down and manifests itself. One of the things that comes down from the mountain, let's say, in religious stories, is also compassion. Without the hierarchy, there is, is it possible for there to be compassion? Because compassion is also the manner in which we accept that nothing ever reaches the ideal, that we can recognize it, but we also know that it's always kind of beyond us. And so there is a sense that is judging us. But there is also a sense in which it kind of yields because, you know, everyg is imperfect, and everything, every, every house is imperfect, every building, everything that we notice, we can also see that it doesn't reach that ideal.

Well, you're like a good mother with a child under six months of age. Because, because human babies are born premature in some fundamental sense.

You know how bad discriminate is? It's like, well, no, it's not. It's differentiation. It's judgment. It's its putting things in their proper place. It's its setting the highest above the lowest. It's, it's formulating a pathway for further development. And you know, a mother might say, you're just fine the way you are. But what's that to say to someone who's well, ten? It's lik, you'reo fini the way you are. You're ten. You got us a lot of growing up to do, and you're probably not fining the way you are when you're 20.

And you could say the same thing about orthodox. He said, catholic is as sane as people ever get. And that's partly because we have to have one foot in the dream and the mystery. We have to, you knowh douglas murray speak recently about this. That was very interesting, as murray is an atheist, essentially, and he has a variety of reasons for that. But he has swung around hard recently. And he said, when he was talking to dave reuben, he said, i don't believe that either conservatism or classic liberalism can sur in the absence of of the religious surround which was really something for him to admit. And it'slike takin him like five years of thinking to come to that conclusion. But then he said something even more remarkable, i thought.

He answered all the questions i asked him with no prevarication. You know, there was a few kind of prepared political talking points and, ah, but i thought he handled himself extremely well. He a very good conversationalist. He could really take turns in a conversation. He was thoughtful. I believe that his care for working class people is genuine. I think his economic policy is unsophisticated to the point of, ah, would you say, danger insufficiency? And i've talked tof some very sophisticated economic players in the canadian market. And they believe that our basic legal framework and our economic framework is forty years out of date. And these are people who've played, let's say, on the international market and got burned badly by hiper qualified american legal experts who just tore them into shreds when they tried to compete on broadscale and international markets. We don't have good policies for data ownership in canada. We're way out of sink with the digital age. We have no idea what we should be owning and what we shouldn't be owning in terms of our our personal information or data.

On Today's Episode: Why is being rich something so many people want, but so few achieve. Does being successful guarantee becoming rich? Obviously that requires you to define what success is for you and your journey. The funny twist in all of this is that being rich is so easily fantasized and yet the work it takes to become rich and successful is barely thought of. Jim Rohn said, ‚ÄúSuccessful people do what unsuccessful people are not willing to do.‚Äù As hard as that is to accept as truth, it is evident when you look at elite athletes, world-class performers, and the best of the best in any field. When you watch this, understand that Tom‚Äôs drive is always fulfillment, meaning, and purpose. The work it takes to achieve his level of success is not easy nor is it for the faint of heart. It‚Äôs not impossible, and it‚Äôs not the only path forward, but it has proven to be majorly successful over and over again. The path to becoming rich and successful is going to require you to dig deep and it requires skills, grit, and determination for you to tap into a level of potential you never knew was possible.

That's what you've got to ask. This whole theme of pivoting, this whole theme of keeping your centre, is about knowing what you want and believing you can make it a reality. But the only way to make it a reality is to put in the work. You've got to put in the work. The change is hard. The change is difficult. The change will demand everything of you. But man, if inside you really believe in what you're doing, you really see how you can get to that goal that you want, if you really see how you can serve other people doing you do with this skill set that you've worked your ass off to acquire, then you can actually make change in people's lives. And that's what motivates me. Getting the skills has real world implications. It took me from scrounging in my couch cushions to find enough change to put gas in my car to building a billion dollar business. It is absolutely limitless what you can accomplish. Now think about that. If that's really true, if what i just said is true, that human potential is limitless, then how you spend your time becomes a spiritual consideration. You're the average of the five peope you spend the most time with. That's just true. And but now it's become so common to say, and it's like every instagram post that i fear it's going to lose its meaning. Who are you spending time with? Because if you're spending time with people like you, you're spending time with people like me, i'm raising you up, or i'm just not going to spend time with you. So it's like, now, if you get in a mix of people like that, who are like men, we'd love for you to raise up to this level. But if you don't, it's fine, but we're just not goin tospend time with you. All of a sudden that desire to belong to something powerful that you can see is going to lead you to your dreams. And i remember saying to my wife over and over and over, they are the surest path to my success. I don't know anything else. I just know if i can hang on to these guys, they're going to make me better. And so that was through all the years of being embarrassed and developing, actually, massive anxiety, because i was always behind. I was always the dumbest person on the phone. I was always the dumbest person in the room. And it was like, was i going to be willing to emotionally go through that to get great? And most people can't. So here's a thing. Now, imagine i'm not the only person they said, hey, this is the start of m you know, any job you want. They i saw 12 people, maybe more, come and go over the years. B u. They just couldn't emotionally deal with it. And so i remember thinking to myself, why is it that i'm able to do this? And the answer was, i could self soothed faster than anyone else. So i would get kicked in the face and i would do something really dumb. I'd be called an idiot, told how stupid i was, and then i'd just be like, r i need to re center. And that just became my obsession. I need to be able to emotionally get back to complete neutral so fast that you don't even see it register on my face. How' you do it? How do you do literally practising. So remember, the same time, i'm reading about the brain voraciously. I'm reading about people that understand human behavior. I'm getting into cognitive science, noral science, like really going into it. So i'm reading all the stuff going wo we're just a chemical processing plant. There are physiological hooks into these chemicals. So hey, if you're ad, scared, whatever, but you force yourself to laugh out loud, you will change your neuro chemical state. And you literally, your experience is the neuro chemistry. So i like woe. So i could get i could be in a situation where 'm being beraded, or i legitimately mess up and it costs money, and it's like, woe. That's on me. And it is. Nobody's bad but my on. And i realize that what most people do, their strategy is to deflect. It is your fault, not my fault. Yes? So i started thinking of this as a metaphor. People are throwing gold at me. They're throwing it really hard, and i can put a shield up and deflect it, but then i lose that piece of gold. If i drop my shield and just take the pain, let it hit me in t head, then i bend down ad go this thing, which was me being</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#012825-becoming-so-good-that-they-cant-stop-you><h3 id=012825-becoming-so-good-that-they-cant-stop-you><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[01:28:25] Becoming So Good That They Can&rsquo;t Stop You</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/5a90c7ac-05ed-4c1c-bf16-24b66a303c24 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 3minÔ∏è (01:28:20 - 01:31:32)</a>

And if you find yourself doing that, i will say, hit the brakes right? Because first and foremost, you always want to look at what you could be doing. So there's two things you could be doing up in your game. No matter how good you think you are, you're still being ignored. And so if we talk about getting so good that they can't ignore you, then we know that we haven't achieved that yet. And then the second thing you can do is move on. And well, i know that i s brutally difficult to hear. If we're dealing with insecurities, then that may be the only solution. So first, i want to focus the most of our attention on this idea that you really can get so good that you can't be ignored. And i think a great example of this is garry van chuck. Now, if you guys don't know his story, it's such a cool story of somebody who came up working for their father. Their dad, i'm sure, in many ways, thought of them the same way that, you know, he was just the kid. And it got to the point where garry saw an opportunity for him to do something in a completely different part of the business, where he could establish himself. So now it was about an area that his father didn't understand, his father didn't have expertese, and garry could show with results, point blank, that he was able to do something that his father wasn't. He took ther a liquor store business from something like six million dollars in revenue to, i think, almost 70 million dollars in revenue. I mes, extraordinary in a relatively short period of time, just a few years, if i'm not mistaken. So that's the kind of thing there's no way, no matter how insecure the other person is, no matter how they may have their own a problems, emotionally soothing, or staying centred, or getting their ego out of the way, whatever the things are that they're dealing with, there's no way to look at those numbers and not say, a ight, clearly, what he was doing is working. And to me, that is where you have to get. You've got to get to the point wherei it would just be absurd to anybody looking at that situation to think that you weren't killing it.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#2503-be-kind-to-the-worst-player><h3 id=2503-be-kind-to-the-worst-player><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[25:03] Be Kind to the Worst Player</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/52389325-c581-4e5d-97ed-856f28003a22 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (24:54 - 27:07)</a>

You're going out of your way to be kind to people. That's if its worth its weight in gold. But you're never going to get people's respect until you're actually good. So now imagine being the best on the team and being kind to the worst player that's pried out the right way about amenites two ideas out. I think you do need to hold the worst player accountable, but john wooden, one of the greatest basketball coaches of all time, said that he would judge people when he was scouting a high school player. That there were times where he would intentionally have like a the tor or the water boy or something, spill water around a player he was recruiting, cause he wanted to see how they would react. And if they were a jerk to that person, he wouldn't bring them on the team. Because he knew it's not just about finding the best players. It's about finding people that can work together, finding ways to create harmony. Le's about michael jordan. Phil jackson said that until he helped michael become a leader, they didn't win championships because michael was so antagonistic. And looked michael was hard on people his whole career. Dong me wrong. But he said he had to help michael understand that he had to play as a team, that this couldn't be just about jordan. And now, if you look at the things that jordan talks about, he always credits the team, the team, the team. I was a part of a winning team. And he'll rattle off the players by name. And if you read 11 rings by phil jackson, he talks about that transition that jordan went through.

Im completely clear about this. There is no way in which you could organize such a a wealth transfer on moral or practical reasons.

But the the er, the almost aggressive tone in which this is now levelled, i don't like the sound of nobody's experience is completely understandable by another human being. Nobody's. And what many people are asking us to do at the moment, us collect tively, is to fall for that thing. I think it was camille faster who said, at first, but i've adopted in recent years, is to say, you must spend an inordinate amount of your life trying to understand me personally, my lived experience, everything about me, you should dedicate your life to into. Do that. Simultaneously, you'll never understand me. This is not an attractive invitation. Thisi this is an unwinnable game.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#4013-do-white-people-experience-raceism><h3 id=4013-do-white-people-experience-raceism><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[40:13] Do White People Experience Raceism?</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/9d7cbe38-cbf8-4808-ad1a-271cc34151f5 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (37:55 - 39:26)</a>

It has a potential to be endless, a you can do it your whole life. And one of the ways i've sort of sort of found myself explainied i osay, it's also important to recognize that resentment is something that can cross absolutely every boundary. So for instance, it crosses all racial boundaries. Obviously, i go without saying more interesting as it crosses all class boundaries and socio economic boundaries. And if i wase to sort of simplify this thought, i would say, i guess that you and i and everybody watching knows, or has known somebody in their lives who has almost nothing in worldly terms, and is a generous person, a kindly person, a giving person, a a happy person, even a cheerful person. And i think wed probably have also, or many of us will have met people who seem to have everything, and who ware filled with resentment, filled with resentment somebody else has held them back from something. Their sister once did something tta she shouldn't. She got this, and i should have got that, and and on and on and on. It's a human trait. And what one of the things that suggests to me is that we therefore have a choice in our lives about this. This is something which we can do something abouti not limitlessly, but for instance, i mean, there are very good reasons thas some people in their lives might feel resentment. Let's say you're involved in a car crash and a friend fell asleep at the wheel, and that's why you are spending the rest of your life in a wheel chair. Tat's a pertinent example of this in american politics at the moment. Am, you would be justified in feeling resentment.

But they never have, and they never will, because the whole thing is rotten from the start. But let me just also say one thing, because, of course, mark isn't as nice as he sounds. Nd, that's one of the things thati try to highlight in the book is, if we're going to do this reductive thing of people in history and saying whell they had views that were of their time, and we must therefore condemn them for them, say, fine, let's do the same thing with marks. And there are things i quote in this book for mark's letters, not least letters to engles. And indeed, in his published writings, in part piece he was writing for the american press in the eight in fifties, the way, he has horrible views on slavery and and and er colonialism and much more. But the main thing is only the horrible things he says about black people and the con use of the nd word. In fact, when i was doing the udea book for the walnwets, i had to decide will i read out the quotes from marks or not. If i had read them out, i'd have been cancelled, because peoplewould have just said, you've been using the end word so much in this passage, and you know this. And i slightly thought doing it, so that i could say i was only quoting marks to try to hit the point home. In the end, of course, i was sensible, and as i did not do but mark's letters are disgusting on these terms. Since i highlighted this in this book, and some of the media have picked it up a and er and have popularized this, i'm trying to put into the system, which is, if you're going to accuse churchill of racism, ou're gon to accuse, accuse jefferson of racism, washington of racism. And someone what about marks? The two things that mariss have said since this came out has been, first of all, why are you saying this about marks? He was a man of his time, like everyone else. And second thing they say is, we don't go to marks for his horrible, abhorrent views on race. They're talking about mixed race people as guerillas and so on. We don't go to him for that. We go to him for his economic theories. I say, ok, well, we don't go to thomas jefferson for his views on slaves. We don't go to churchill for his the precise language he used that points in the 19 tens about indians, or his health advice, or his health advice. Wesh, i do get in for that.

It's the thing we've invented for the communication of those ideas that are not necessarily the deep representation of those ideas. Yes. So what a what's the what's a good way to model such powerful mathematical reasoning? Would you say, what are some ideas you have for capturing this in a model? The</blockquote><br><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br><br>insight that human mathematicians have had is a combination of the kind of, the intuitive, kind of connection s like knowledge that makes it so that something is just like, obviously true, so that you don't have to think about why it's true. That then makes it possible to then take the next step and ponder and reason and figure out something that you previously didn't have that intuition about. It then ultimately becomes a part of the intuition that the next generation of mathematical thinkers have to ground their own thinking on, so that they can extend the ideas even further. I came across this quotation from enri poincare while i was walking in the in the woods with my wife in a state park in northern californiaa late last summer. And what it said on the bench was, it is by logic that we prove, by intuition that we discover. And so what what for me, the essence of the of the project is to understand how to bring the intuitive connectionist resources to bear on letting the intuitive discovery arise, you know, from engagement in thinking with this formal system. So i think of, you know, the ability of somebody like hinton or newton, or einstein, or romelhart, or picera, to a archimedes, another example, writes, suddenly a flash of insight occurs. It's, it's like the constellation of all o these simultaneous constraints that somehow or other causes the mind to settle into a novel state that it never did before, and and give rise to a new idea a that, you know, then you can say, ok, well, now, how can i prove this? You know, how do i write down the steps of that theorem that that allow me to make it rigorous and certain? And so i feel like the the kinds of things that we're beginning to see deep learning systems do of their own accord kind of gives me this feeling of, of, am, i don't know, hope or encouragement that ultimately, um, it'll all happen. Am, so in particular, as a many people now, have have become really interested in thinking about, you know, noral networks that have been trained with massive amounts of text can be given a prompt, and they can then sort of generate some really interesting, fanciful, creative story from that prompt. A and ah, there's, there's kind of like a sense that they've somehow synthesized something like a novel out of the, you know, all f the particulars of all the billions and billions of experiences that went into the training data, that it gives rise to something like this sort of intuitive sense of what would be a, a fun and interesting little story to tell, or something like that. It just sort of wells up out of the, out of the letting the thing play out its own imagining of what somebody might say given this prompt, as as impot to get itto to start to generate its own thoughts and and to me, that that sort of represents the potential of capturing this, the intuitive side of this.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#015227-the-difference-between-language-and-mathematical-cognition><h3 id=015227-the-difference-between-language-and-mathematical-cognition><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[01:52:27] The Difference Between Language and Mathematical Cognition</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/fd70617a-7d16-4f01-91f5-ffcda7d8ef2f rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 4minÔ∏è (01:48:57 - 01:53:09)</a>

I think that's a very interesting question, and i think it's one of the ones that i'm actually very interested in right now. A, but i i think the answer is, in important ways, it is important draw that line, but then to come back and look at it again and see some of the subtleties and interesting aspects of the difference. A, so if we think about chomsky himself, um, he e was born into an academic family. His father was a professor of rabinical studies at a small rabbinical college in philadelphia. A, and he was deeply inculturated in a, you know, a culture of thought and reason, and brought to the effort to understand natural language this profound engagement with these formal systems. And a, you know, i think that there was tremendous power in that, and that chamsky had some azing insight into the structure of natural language. But that use the word but there, the actual intuitive knowledge of these things only goes so far, and does not go as far as it does in people like thomsky himself. And this was something that was discovered in the phd. Dissertation of lila glightman, who was actually trained in the same linguistic department with chomsky. So what lila discovered was that the intuitions that linguists had about even the meaning of a phrase, not just about its but about what they thought a phrase must mean, were very different from the intuitions of an ordinary person who wasn't a formally trained thinker. And well, it recently has become much more salient. I happened to have learned about this when i myself was a ph d. Student at the university of pennsylvania, but im i never knew how to put it together with all my other thinking about these things. So so i actually currently have the hypothesis that formerly trained linguists and other formally trained a academics, whether it be linguistics, philosophy, cognitive science, computer s, machine learning, mathematics, a have a mot if engagement with experience that is intuitively, deeply structured to be more organized around a the systematicity, a and a ability to be conformant with the principles of a system than a than is actually true of the natural human</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#015337-the-expert-blind-spot-is-more-prosaic><h3 id=015337-the-expert-blind-spot-is-more-prosaic><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[01:53:37] The Expert Blind Spot Is More Prosaic</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/03fa38c8-730b-4bdd-b409-6c112e0389e9 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (01:53:09 - 01:55:23)</a>

And so, well, they were psyc atrist, right? So i had to be a psychiatrist. Anda that meant i had to go to medical school. And i got to college, and i find myself taking, you know, the first semester of a three quarter physics class, and it was mechanics. And this was so far from what it was i was interested in, but it was also too early in the morning, in the winter quart somester. So i never made it of the physics class. But i wandered about the rest of my freshman year and most of my sophomore year until, a, i found myself in the midst of this situation where around me, m there was this big revolution happening. I was at columbia university in 19 68, and the via um war is going on. Columbia is building a gim in morningside heights, which is part of harlem. And people are thinking, oh, the big bad rich guys are stealing the the the park land that belong to the people of harlem. And a, you know, they're part of the military industrial complex, which is enslaving us and sending us all off to war in vianom. And so there is a big revolution that a confluence of black activism and, you know, s t s and social justice, and the whole university blew up and got shut down. And a, i got a chance to sort of think about why people were behaving the way they were in this context. And i, you know, i happened to have taken mathematical statistics. I happened to have been takin psychology that quarter, ad just sike one and somehow things in that space all ran together in my mind and got me really excited about about asking questions about why people, what made certain people go into the buildings and not others, and things like that. And so suddenly i had a path forward. And i had just been wandering around aimlessly and athe different points my career, you know, when i think, ok, well, should i take this class? Or should i just read that book about some idea that i want to understand better, you know? Or should i, should i pursue the thing that excites me and interests me, or should i, you know, meet somereu ment? You know, that's i always did the latter. So i ended up, my, my professors in psychology were thought i was great. They wanted me to go to graduate school. They deynominated me for fibeta capa.

I think that most of the time, the way the body works is the best solution. I haven't seen many alternatives, so it's hard to compare. But a, i think, you know, there's some parts of the body that make more sense than others. You know, the way our hands work, for instance. Ah, you know, the muscles are up in the forearm, and the tendons kind of come down likea strings on a puppet. And just the dexterity it gives our hands is just really amazing. And it's hard to imagine a better, a better tool than the human hand to do everything, from, you now, hold things, to play piano and do a million other daily activities that we do. One thing i talk about in the book, there's some other body parts that seem to be lacking that kind of brilliant a design, such as the throat. You know, where thea food drink are swallowed and air is inhaled. And they kind of, those two paths come within millimeters of each other, and you slip up once you laugh while eating, or you speak while trying to swallow, and you die from choking. So it seems less than optimal, though i'm not sure it could be better. From the way we're kindof formed in the womb as a beginning as the tiny little tube. I don't think it could have been done any better, or there's any other way to do it. But it is an unfortunate thing that ou kno, does lead to some problems.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#1006-the-thumb-is-it-fundamental-to-humanity><h3 id=1006-the-thumb-is-it-fundamental-to-humanity><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[10:06] The Thumb, Is It Fundamental To Humanity?</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/284280d5-1f66-4140-8339-03a3ef996ca3 rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (08:37 - 10:04)</a>

And you know, when we when plastic surgeons, wo are often the ones to repair thatome the dorothopetic surgeons. They will debate, you know, how important is it to save this finger, or how important is it to save, you know, let's say, the kind of tip, the one third, the tip, one third of one of your fingers. You know, t depends on the length that you'll lose, it depends on which finger. And so the thumb really is them crucial a just, you know, for your occupation. In most cases too, just daily life, um, and your ability to get around, take care of yourself an others.

You know, if anyone's ever been to the doctor and had five to ten tubes of blood removed from them, it can be quite surprising how much they take outd and it's, you know, that's the limitation of our technology, that we need those volumes of blood to all the tests that we want to and so the promise of theranos was that perhaps with a single drop of blood, we would be able to know as much about the persons, the condition of their body, and without drawing all that blood. And thereby, you know, there would be these devices she was going to create that would sort of do it, you put a drop of blood in and spits out thing you ever wanted to know about what's in your blood stream. And in a way, that would make it so much easier. You know, it could be, you could have one in your home, theoretically. And you i don't know why you'd wonder what your potassium level is on any given day, but you could check if you wanted to. Ah, and so that that goal is very worthy. You know, i put that goal up there with a the frontier of making pain killers that are as good as opioids, without the addictive quality. You know, that would be such a huge revolution if we did have that in medicine. But, and particularly for me, cause i trained in both pediatrics and internal medicine, so i learned to care for both children and adults. In children we do draw much less blood.

You know, when r believe our ancestors started off as single celled organisms floating in some ancient brew, and they were surrounded by the medium that would bring them all the nutrients they needed, so there's no issues there. Then once you start getting multi cellular organisms, the kind that are thicker, and the ones on the inside are in contact with that sort of nutritious brew that they're growing in, ah, you kind of need a way to distribute those nutrients to every cell. And so that's what the heart and the branching vascular tree do. So the heart, you know, it's, it's the most, the biggest disconnect between how the organs talked about in poetry and through history versus is actual function is probably the heart, cause we ascribe all these things, love and passion and life itself, sometimes, to the heart. But actually, it's just a simple mechanical pump, you know, that's all it is. I don't wan to down playht, it's amazing, but, you know, it just pushes, it fills theth blood and then squeezes, it fills the blood and squeezes it.

I mean, let's also discuss the testicle. You know, they're very important too. I mean, ce yes, ough, they're fragile and they're important, and yet they're hanging off the body, in danger, basically. So, um, does that make sense? You know, they begin in the womb, they begin inside the abdomen, and they slowly descend and n sometimes before birth, sometimes in the first year of sometimes never. They pop out of the body and an up hanging in the scrotum. There's a reason, because the chemical reactions that create sperm function best at a few degrees cooler than body temperature. And so that's why you might notice in the warm weather, they might hang further down, and in the cold weather, they scrunched themselves up to get closer to the body to maintain that ideal temperature a few degrees cooler.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#010234-artificial-womb><h3 id=010234-artificial-womb><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>[01:02:34] Artificial Womb</h3></a><p><a href=https://share.snipd.com/snip/73bd0378-c3c7-4b8d-9776-e535ac0299ea rel=noopener>üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (01:01:13 - 01:02:35)</a>

Were in way smarter than we were in the past. And then thereis these, like, interesting studies that think, robin hanson mentioned it to me that if you look at the entirety of medication, like the effect of medication on human health, if you do those kinds of broad studies, does it actually help, like toes quality of life, live a certain measures of well being, does iin look at human society as a whole, does taking medication or not actually help? And those studies find thereis no positive or negative effect if medication. And that's a very, kind of o interesting perspective. You could probably argue in a lot of ways. But the point is a cause. Cause you can bring up literally a billion cases where medication has significant positive impact on a particular patient. But you have to kind of zoom out and honestly look at possitive effects of medicine of life styled choices die, choicesof exercise or not.</blockquote></details><hr><a href=#george-hotz-commaai-openpilot-and-autonomous-vehicles><h1 id=george-hotz-commaai-openpilot-and-autonomous-vehicles><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>George Hotz: Comma.ai, OpenPilot, and Autonomous Vehicles</h1></a><p><img src="https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flexfridman.com%2Fwordpress%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fpowerpress%2Fartwork_3000-230.png&w=200&h=200" width=200 alt=Cover|200></p><a href=#episode-metadata-36><h2 id=episode-metadata-36><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Episode Metadata</h2></a><ul><li>Episode title:: <a class="internal-link broken">George Hotz: Comma.ai, OpenPilot, and Autonomous Vehicles</a></li><li>Show:: <a class="internal-link broken">Lex Fridman Podcast</a></li><li>Owner / Host:: <a href=/quartz/obsidian/Sources/Podcasts/Lex-Fridman rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/obsidian/Sources/Podcasts/Lex-Fridman>Lex Fridman</a></li><li>Episode link::
