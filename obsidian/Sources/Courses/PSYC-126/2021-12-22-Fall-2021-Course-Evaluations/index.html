<strong>A</strong> Strengths: Amazing sense of humor from Scholl, lectures are fun. Weaknesses: Course is disorganized and grading in exams is all-or-nothing (basically no partial credit on short answers, and you don&rsquo;t get points unless you say exact words or phrases). So if you are unlucky (like me), you might get your lowest grade ever in the midterm.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> What is your overall assessment of this course?</p><p><em>(Your anonymous response to this question may be viewed by Yale College students, faculty, and advisers to aid in course selection and evaluating teaching.)</em>

<strong>A</strong> Not unless you have to or Credit D Fail. Even after this class, I cannot explain to a student &ldquo;What did I learn?&rdquo; due to the disorganized nature of curriculum. The grading in midterms and finals are all-or-nothing, which can lead to brutal unsalvagable grade situations.</p><p><strong>10.</strong> Summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the instructor.

<strong>A</strong> Strengths: Piskac is super nice, was super generous with homework. You feel a lot more comfortable with C afterwards. Weaknesses: Homework was brutal and varied in workload drastically. Pset 4 was especially difficult.
