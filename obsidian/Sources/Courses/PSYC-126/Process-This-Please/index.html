Are [Communal relationships] meant to be long term and [Exchange relationships] short term? No because ‚Üì - The lack of record keeping argues against that 1.

    Expressing emotions is an act of vulnerability with [benefits]  and [risks]
    benefits ‚Üí Strengthen relationships, open door to getting support
    risks ‚Üí ignored, taken advantage, responded to negatively

Invisible support ‚Üí The best kind of support is the kind that isn&rsquo;t recognized by the target as support
On 61% of days partners agreed about the presence or absence of support exchanges
When examinees perceived receiving support, they felt more anxious the next day
BUT when examinees didn&rsquo;t perceive receiving support but their partner reported providing support, they were the least anxious
Emotional support that doesn&rsquo;t strike the target as emotional support is the best kind
Culture and Social Support
Individualistic cultures view the self as independent and ask for support more {{easily}}
Collectivist cultures view the self as {{ interdependent }} and resist asking for support for fear of being a {{ burden or relationship consequences}}
What ultimately matters is what we {{ <strong>think</strong> }} our partners do for us.

three components ‚Üì - Understanding (asking questions) 1. Validating (validating emotions) 1. Caring (support)
Capitalization ‚Üí the sharing of a beneficial or positive event with others and deriving additional benefit from this sharing

study
154 undergraduates completed 7 day daily diary study

Relationship outcomes are better with {{active-constructive}} support, and the other three are worse
Active-constructive are simultaneously understanding, caring, and responsive
Gratitude ‚Üí The quality of being thankful
Examples
Verbal thanks
Expression of appreciation
Repayment
[Gratitude] <strong>finds</strong> , <strong>reminds</strong> , and <strong>binds</strong> ‚Üì
<strong>Finds</strong> new relationship partners
<strong>Reminds</strong> us of good, responsive, relationship partners
<strong>Binds</strong> recipient and benefactor together
Little sister study
Gratitude was predicted by relational appraisals of the benefit received (rated thoughtfulness of the big sister)
Gratitude at the time of the gift receipt predicted little sisters&rsquo; feelings about their unknown big sisters (more gratitude, more liking)
We feel really good after receiving gratitude
Expressers of gratitude
{{Underestimated}} how surprised or positive recipients feel after receiving gratitude
{{Overestimated}} how awkward recipients feel after receiving gratitude
{{Underestimated}} how surprised recipients feel after receiving letter and content
People think others know how they feel and grateful, but that is not true
Expressing gratitude is simple and low cost, but the potential benefits to the relationship are meaningful</p><pre><code>        ![](local:///Users/braden/remnote/Braden_W/files/RXDG22lvQxhdC8UpuAK6nL4lSbxXyCSX__crQ9q1X77pQuqcXkK6wjgmnewkKIjX-8CWs74vy4N29UjsB1RlkXRc72u3PiVmehhbYamSxDSipidCWR2CrgB8wskEh4gd.png)
