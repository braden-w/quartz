Yet, it is from meat that so many complex developments, interactions, and phenomena have risen. As the story remarked, humans have somehow managed to create radio waves, technology, etc., in spite of our ability to be simplistically characterized. To the external observer, that is remarkable.</p><p>In my opinion, there is something beautiful about the <a class="internal-link broken">stochastic nature of humanity‚Äôs existence</a>. As ‚Äúmeat‚Äù, we can be so simply characterized yet are also so overwhelmingly complex. It is truly a marvel to realize how much we are able to achieve, and that from our <a class="internal-link broken">stochastic nature</a> and biological processes have risen both order (such as machines and technology) and chaos.</p><a href=#marcus-et-al-2014-and-carandini-2012><h2 id=marcus-et-al-2014-and-carandini-2012><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Marcus et al.

Part of Marr&rsquo;s 3 Levels is comprised of computational, algorithmic, and implementation level details, and all three are essential, as we explored in class. As professor Scholl mentioned, a ‚Äúrule in science&mldr;is to seek an appropriate level of description‚Äù, and there are processes on each level that should be appropriately described. A graph of a Commodore 64 computer‚Äôs circuitry is not insightful enough to how it works‚Äîand it is even worse for human brains, whose wiring and responses vary across humans.</p><a href=#sacks-2004><h2 id=sacks-2004><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Sacks (2004)</h2></a><a href=#this-new-yorker-article-gives-a-nice-initial-sense-of-how-wonderfully-strange-the-mind-and-especially-the-scientific-study-of-the-mind-can-be-while-the-distortions-of-temporal-perception-experienced-by-the-patients-described-here-are-extreme-and-extremely-fascinating-we-all-have-the-experience-of-time-passing-or-seeming-to-pass-quickly-in-some-situations-but-slowly-in-others-just-based-on-your-own-experience-name-one-or-two-factors-that-you-think-might-be-responsible-for-those-different-speeds-of-experience><h4 id=this-new-yorker-article-gives-a-nice-initial-sense-of-how-wonderfully-strange-the-mind-and-especially-the-scientific-study-of-the-mind-can-be-while-the-distortions-of-temporal-perception-experienced-by-the-patients-described-here-are-extreme-and-extremely-fascinating-we-all-have-the-experience-of-time-passing-or-seeming-to-pass-quickly-in-some-situations-but-slowly-in-others-just-based-on-your-own-experience-name-one-or-two-factors-that-you-think-might-be-responsible-for-those-different-speeds-of-experience><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>This New Yorker article gives a nice initial sense of how wonderfully strange the mind (and especially the scientific study of the mind!) can be. While the distortions of temporal perception experienced by the patients described here are extreme (and extremely fascinating), we all have the experience of time passing (or seeming to pass?) quickly in some situations, but slowly in others. Just based on your own experience, name one or two factors that you think might be responsible for those different &ldquo;speeds&rdquo; of experience.</h4></a><p>I think one of the most notable factors that lead to different ‚Äúspeeds‚Äù of experience is the amount of salience and new exposure in the experience. For example, being in a situation that is saturated with new and unprecedented experiences would cause the time to go slower, as we are soaking in so much information in a short amount of time and are given the impression that time goes slower. In contrast, an experience with things we are very familiar with would cause the time to go by more quickly. This is a possible explanation why going to a place by car often feels much slower than the return trip back.</p><a href=#bouchard-2008><h2 id=bouchard-2008><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Bouchard (2008)</h2></a><a href=#this-is-a-fairly-dense-and-detailed-chapter-imagine-that-a-classmate-saw-the-article-sitting-next-to-you-at-dinner-and-asked-so-do-genes-really-determine-our-behavior-how-might-you-summarize-the-main-points-of-this-chapter-in-just-a-few-sentences><h4 id=this-is-a-fairly-dense-and-detailed-chapter-imagine-that-a-classmate-saw-the-article-sitting-next-to-you-at-dinner-and-asked-so-do-genes-really-determine-our-behavior-how-might-you-summarize-the-main-points-of-this-chapter-in-just-a-few-sentences><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>This is a fairly dense and detailed chapter! Imagine that a classmate saw the article sitting next to you at dinner, and asked: &ldquo;So, do genes really determine our behavior?&rdquo; How might you summarize the main points of this chapter in just a few sentences?</h4></a><p>It‚Äôs plausible to say that there is an inextricably link between genes and our behavior, though the degree of the influence is still up for question. As Lynch and Walsh (1998) have put it, &ldquo;If one&rsquo;s sole interest in performing a quantitative-genetic analysis is to demonstrate that the character of interest is heritable, there is probably little point in expending the effort. The outcome is virtually certain. Almost every character in almost every species that has been studied intensively exhibits nonzero heritability&rdquo;. When it comes to personality, we also had another study which reported that all 11 personality traits are ‚Äúsignificantly heritable‚Äù, with a mean of .44. However, there were also studies that demonstrated that intelligence between identical twins was influenced by the environment.

This is because classification requires a degree of cognition and experience that I think the children would not have yet. Computer vision is an incredibly difficult task in the realm of artificial intelligence (for good reason) and so I believe that it could also cause children some degree of difficulty. I think the ability to recognize light could be rapidly acquired.

This is most noticeable when there are conflicts between our emotions and thought. For instance, one may feel a sudden swell of anger or resentment as an instinctual reaction to an injustice, even though a person may conclude that the emotion is unjustified. How a person feels and how they want to feel are two different things.</p><p>On the other hand, one could also characterize emotions as being non-modular because they seem to be a result of multiple cognitive processes/influenced by our thoughts.

To get a better sense for this distinction, please apply it to one or more of the thorny disputes we&rsquo;ve seen recently between Democrats and Republicans. Suppose that a Democrat is trying to predict what Republicans will think about a given question, and now suppose that the Democrat&rsquo;s prediction ends up being completely wrong.

In theory theory, one applies a more theoretical approach: for example, as the reading writes, if someone believes <em>p</em> and <em>if p then q</em>, then other things being equal, they will believe <em>q</em>.

After you read the target article (excepting Section 2, which isn&rsquo;t required), browse through the many ensuing commentaries from other scientists &ndash; nearly all of which argue against the target article in some way, by design &ndash; and pick one that sounds especially intriguing to you. Then, after reading it carefully, let us know in one paragraph what you think about the status of the debate after reading that commentary. In particular: (1) Summarize the key points of the commentary in a few sentences. (2) Then discuss: did you find the commentary to be compelling? Why or why not? (You can then also search the authors&rsquo; response &ndash; which starts on p. 53 &ndash; in order to see how we actually responded to your chosen commentary, and then if you want to also incorporate that into your RQ answer, that&rsquo;s fine &ndash; but you don&rsquo;t have to do that.)</h4></a><p>I chose Balcetis & Cole: <em>Task demand not so damning: Improved techniques that mitigate demand in studies that support top-down effects.</em> The commentary asserted that Firestone & Scholl&rsquo;s techniques in their study were fundamentally flawed because they introduced new forms of demand, and proposed 5 different alternative methods to mitigate these effects. These five were accuracy incentives to limit the chance of response bias, using counterintuitive behavioral responses, between-subject designs, double-blind hypothesis testing, and dissociating participiants&rsquo; perceptual experiences. From the response on page 59, we see that Firestone & Scholl argued these new recommendations are &ldquo;no substitute for the nonnegotiable strategies of masking demand and carefully debriefing subjects about the experiment&rdquo;‚Äì and in many cases these supposedly ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù techniques actually worsen the problem of demand (they were not &ldquo;superier, or even remotely sufficient&rdquo;). Though I initially thought the commentary to be convincing (specifically since there were 5 alternatives proposed), I think that the response was incredibly thorough in addressing all five and changed my mind once again.</p><a href=#most-et-al-2001-or-new--scholl-2008><h2 id=most-et-al-2001-or-new--scholl-2008><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Most et al.

The arrows are similar to anchors because they are additional information that doesn&rsquo;t change the correct answer (the length of the line), but can drastically influence one&rsquo;s estimations if presented.
